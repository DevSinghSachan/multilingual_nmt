__de__ When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
__de__ My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
__de__ There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
__de__ &quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
__de__ I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
__de__ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
__de__ A morning that I will never forget .
__de__ A real school .
__de__ You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
__de__ So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
__de__ It was the only way we both could be educated .
__de__ Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
__de__ We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
__de__ The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
__de__ It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
__de__ We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
__de__ From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
__de__ We always wondered what they knew about us .
__de__ Were we being followed ?
__de__ Do they know where we live ?
__de__ We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
__de__ I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
__de__ My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
__de__ A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
__de__ But my educated mother became a teacher .
__de__ There she is .
__de__ She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
__de__ And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
__de__ There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
__de__ To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
__de__ During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
__de__ I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
__de__ Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
__de__ But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
__de__ So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
__de__ I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
__de__ Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
__de__ Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
__de__ ( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
__de__ He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
__de__ ( Applause ) My family believes in me .
__de__ I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
__de__ That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
__de__ That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
__de__ The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
__de__ And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
__de__ Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
__de__ Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
__de__ As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
__de__ It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
__de__ In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
__de__ Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
__de__ But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
__de__ ( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
__de__ I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
__de__ I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
__de__ But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
__de__ To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
__de__ Like me , they are dreaming big .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ And you &apos;ll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
__de__ And slightly more complex things appear .
__de__ That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
__de__ And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
__de__ But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
__de__ Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
__de__ Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
__de__ We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
__de__ What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
__de__ How old are you ? What do you do ?
__de__ Then we get more personal with it .
__de__ Have you ever had any diseases ?
__de__ Have you ever been divorced ?
__de__ Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
__de__ What are you into ? Who are you into ?
__de__ What gender do you like to sleep with ?
__de__ I get it .
__de__ We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
__de__ We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
__de__ We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
__de__ We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
__de__ Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
__de__ Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
__de__ The boxes are too narrow .
__de__ And this can get really dangerous .
__de__ So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
__de__ I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
__de__ I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
__de__ I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
__de__ Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
__de__ ( Laughter ) It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
__de__ So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
__de__ I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
__de__ They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
__de__ So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
__de__ When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
__de__ I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
__de__ I kept up the charade for eight years .
__de__ So this is me when I was 11 .
__de__ I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
__de__ See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
__de__ In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
__de__ Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
__de__ When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
__de__ At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
__de__ It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
__de__ I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
__de__ I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
__de__ I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
__de__ If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
__de__ But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
__de__ Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
__de__ When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
__de__ No one is exactly shocked .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
__de__ When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
__de__ Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
__de__ See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
__de__ I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
__de__ So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
__de__ And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
__de__ But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
__de__ And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
__de__ And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
__de__ If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
__de__ At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
__de__ I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines — girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
__de__ I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
__de__ And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
__de__ I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
__de__ I was not an activist .
__de__ I wave no flags in my own life .
__de__ But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
__de__ How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
__de__ Were we even a group ? What group ?
__de__ And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
__de__ Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
__de__ And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
__de__ It might give them pause .
__de__ Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
__de__ Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
__de__ For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
__de__ Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
__de__ So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
__de__ And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
__de__ So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
__de__ And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
__de__ And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
__de__ And then we made this .
__de__ ( Music ) Video : I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
__de__ Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
__de__ My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
__de__ My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
__de__ ( Music ) &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
__de__ It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
__de__ We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
__de__ There is no equality in the United States .
__de__ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Marriage &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Freedom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
__de__ The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
__de__ Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
__de__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
__de__ So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
__de__ And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
__de__ I want to take the project across the country .
__de__ I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
__de__ This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
__de__ I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
__de__ ( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Self evident truths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) iO Tillett Wright : Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
__de__ Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
__de__ And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
__de__ So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
__de__ That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
__de__ I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
__de__ Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
__de__ So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
__de__ Visibility really is key .
__de__ Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
__de__ Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
__de__ Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
__de__ Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
__de__ But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
__de__ In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
__de__ It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
__de__ It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
__de__ At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; gays &quot; &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
__de__ Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
__de__ At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
__de__ And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
__de__ ( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
__de__ Can you quantify your openness ?
__de__ Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
__de__ Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
__de__ I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; &quot; Grey . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
__de__ And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
__de__ I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
__de__ ( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
__de__ The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
__de__ And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
__de__ Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
__de__ Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
__de__ Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
__de__ Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
__de__ Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
__de__ After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
__de__ Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
__de__ So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
__de__ Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
__de__ Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
__de__ What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
__de__ And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
__de__ At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
__de__ So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
__de__ Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
__de__ It &apos;s too late .
__de__ Because I already am all of those things .
__de__ We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
__de__ So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
__de__ The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
__de__ I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
__de__ I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
__de__ Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
__de__ When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
__de__ As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
__de__ I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
__de__ For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
__de__ Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
__de__ We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
__de__ After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
__de__ It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
__de__ Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
__de__ Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
__de__ Some I even considered like my second home .
__de__ But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
__de__ A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
__de__ That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
__de__ A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
__de__ That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
__de__ Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
__de__ Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
__de__ Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
__de__ Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
__de__ Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
__de__ In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
__de__ This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
__de__ Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
__de__ Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
__de__ There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
__de__ So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
__de__ Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
__de__ Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
__de__ I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
__de__ I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
__de__ I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
__de__ I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
__de__ I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
__de__ As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
__de__ In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
__de__ The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
__de__ It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
__de__ How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
__de__ Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
__de__ They have nothing to compare it to .
__de__ When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
__de__ I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
__de__ Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
__de__ In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
__de__ They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
__de__ This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
__de__ It was more like a restaurant .
__de__ Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
__de__ Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
__de__ Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
__de__ The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
__de__ Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
__de__ I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
__de__ There were no back doors .
__de__ There were no windows large enough to climb through .
__de__ These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
__de__ Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
__de__ Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
__de__ It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
__de__ The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
__de__ I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
__de__ This is a family portrait .
__de__ The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
__de__ They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
__de__ My interpreter told me their stories .
__de__ &quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
__de__ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
__de__ When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
__de__ I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
__de__ Wrong . They were all enslaved .
__de__ Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
__de__ This young child is eight years old .
__de__ He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
__de__ He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
__de__ The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
__de__ Many of them drown .
__de__ For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
__de__ Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
__de__ I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
__de__ in the cold , windy night .
__de__ And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
__de__ I want to introduce you to Kofi .
__de__ Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
__de__ I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
__de__ Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
__de__ Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
__de__ Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
__de__ Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
__de__ He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
__de__ At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
__de__ Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
__de__ After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
__de__ Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
__de__ Mercury is used in the extraction process .
__de__ These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
__de__ When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
__de__ I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
__de__ The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
__de__ At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
__de__ All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
__de__ In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
__de__ This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
__de__ When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
__de__ When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
__de__ On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
__de__ Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
__de__ I want to shine a light on slavery .
__de__ When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
__de__ They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
__de__ I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
__de__ I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
__de__ These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
__de__ There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
__de__ I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
__de__ Thank you very much .

__de__ The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
__de__ But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
__de__ Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
__de__ So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
__de__ These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
__de__ In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban .
__de__ And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
__de__ And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
__de__ Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
__de__ At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
__de__ So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
__de__ We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
__de__ This is our group , our main group of weavers .
__de__ They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
__de__ They all have bank accounts .
__de__ They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
__de__ It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
__de__ This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
__de__ And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
__de__ And the rest says it all .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
__de__ If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
__de__ Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
__de__ Here &apos;s my clock .
__de__ It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
__de__ Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
__de__ So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
__de__ At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
__de__ Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
__de__ So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
__de__ However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__de__ It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
__de__ In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
__de__ In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
__de__ This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
__de__ So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
__de__ Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
__de__ You can see why I hate Chris .
__de__ One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
__de__ This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
__de__ All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
__de__ Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
__de__ And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
__de__ So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
__de__ To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
__de__ Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
__de__ Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
__de__ Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
__de__ Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
__de__ ( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
__de__ So here are some other results .
__de__ The first is for instant noodles .
__de__ Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
__de__ You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
__de__ OK , next , clubbing .
__de__ These people I still do hang out with .
__de__ All right , and smoking .
__de__ Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
__de__ OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
__de__ It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
__de__ Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
__de__ In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
__de__ That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
__de__ Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
__de__ So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
__de__ Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
__de__ And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
__de__ You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
__de__ Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__de__ It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
__de__ In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
__de__ And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
__de__ You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
__de__ Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
__de__ So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
__de__ Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
__de__ We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
__de__ So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
__de__ Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
__de__ It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
__de__ Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
__de__ Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
__de__ Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
__de__ There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
__de__ Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
__de__ Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
__de__ Oh , one last thing before I leave .
__de__ And the best way to do that is with free candy .
__de__ You guys ready ?
__de__ All right .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ When I was six years old , I received my gifts .
__de__ My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea .
__de__ So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom , and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner .
__de__ And she said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we just stand here and compliment each other ?
__de__ What could go wrong ?
__de__ And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ...
__de__ and three left .
__de__ And I was one of them .
__de__ And the compliments stopped .
__de__ Well , at that moment , I was crying .
__de__ And the teacher was freaking out .
__de__ But I don &apos;t know who felt worse that day .
__de__ She must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds .
__de__ That &apos;s one version .
__de__ Then fast-forward eight years .
__de__ Bill Gates came to my hometown — Beijing , China — to speak , and I saw his message .
__de__ I fell in love with that guy .
__de__ I thought , wow , I know what I want to do now .
__de__ And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad handwriting , but I did highlight some key words .
__de__ You get the idea .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So ...
__de__ that was another version of me : one who will conquer the world .
__de__ I jumped on it , because that was where Bill Gates lived , right ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey .
__de__ Then , fast-forward another 14 years .
__de__ I was 30 .
__de__ Nope , I didn &apos;t build that company .
__de__ I didn &apos;t even start .
__de__ I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company .
__de__ Why is that ?
__de__ Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter ?
__de__ It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
__de__ One wanted to conquer the world — make a difference — another was afraid of rejection .
__de__ And every time that six-year-old won .
__de__ And this fear even persisted after I started my own company .
__de__ I mean , I started my own company when I was 30 — if you want to be Bill Gates , you &apos;ve got to start sooner or later , right ?
__de__ When I was an entrepreneur , I was presented with an investment opportunity , and then I was turned down .
__de__ And that rejection hurt me .
__de__ It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there .
__de__ But then I thought , hey , would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection ?
__de__ Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that ?
__de__ No way .
__de__ And this is where it clicked for me .
__de__ OK , I can build a better company .
__de__ I can build a better team or better product , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better leader .
__de__ I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore .
__de__ Google was my friend .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But why was I still so scared ?
__de__ It &apos;s called rejectiontherapy.com.
__de__ His name is Jason Comely .
__de__ And I loved that idea .
__de__ And so here &apos;s what I did .
__de__ This is what the blog looked like .
__de__ Day One ...
__de__ ( Laughter ) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger .
__de__ So this is where I went to where I was working .
__de__ I came downstairs and I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk .
__de__ He looked like a security guard .
__de__ So I just approached him .
__de__ And I was just walking and that was the longest walk of my life — hair on the back of my neck standing up , I was sweating and my heart was pounding .
__de__ But because I filmed myself — so that night I was watching myself getting rejected , I just saw how scared I was .
__de__ I looked like this kid in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense . &quot; &quot; I saw dead people .
__de__ You know , he wasn &apos;t that menacing .
__de__ And I could &apos;ve said many things .
__de__ I could &apos;ve explained , I could &apos;ve negotiated .
__de__ I didn &apos;t do any of that .
__de__ I felt , wow , this is like a microcosm of my life .
__de__ And you know what ?
__de__ The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run .
__de__ I &apos;ll stay engaged .
__de__ And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done burger refill .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
__de__ But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time was no longer there , just because I stayed engaged — because I didn &apos;t run .
__de__ I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , great , I &apos;m already learning things .
__de__ Great . &quot; &quot; And then Day Three : Getting Olympic Doughnuts .
__de__ I went to a Krispy Kreme .
__de__ It &apos;s a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part of the United States .
__de__ I &apos;m sure they have some here , too .
__de__ And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; Can you make me doughnuts that look like Olympic symbols ?
__de__ Basically , you interlink five doughnuts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say yes , right ?
__de__ The doughnut maker took me so seriously .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So she put out paper , started jotting down the colors and the rings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings .
__de__ And I was so touched .
__de__ I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
__de__ And that video got over five million views on Youtube .
__de__ The world couldn &apos;t believe that either .
__de__ A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is awesome . &quot; &quot; But you know , fame and notoriety did not do anything to me .
__de__ What I really wanted to do was learn , and to change myself .
__de__ So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground — into this research project .
__de__ I wanted to see what I could learn .
__de__ And then I learned a lot of things .
__de__ I discovered so many secrets .
__de__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard .
__de__ If you want to do this , go across the street and talk to Connie .
__de__ She loves flowers . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__de__ I went across and knocked on Connie &apos;s door .
__de__ And she was so happy to see me .
__de__ I &apos;m sure it looks better now .
__de__ It was none of those .
__de__ It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted .
__de__ And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral , using a sales term .
__de__ I converted a referral .
__de__ So for example , one day I went to a Starbucks , and asked the manager , &quot; &quot; Hey , can I be a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Do you know those Walmart greeters ?
__de__ You know , those people who say &apos; hi &apos; to you before you walk in the store , and make sure you don &apos;t steal stuff , basically ?
__de__ It &apos;s as if he &apos;s putting all the doubt on the floor .
__de__ I said &quot; &quot; hi &quot; &quot; to every customer that walked in , and gave them holiday cheers .
__de__ By the way , I don &apos;t know what your career trajectory is , don &apos;t be a greeter .
__de__ ( Laughter ) It was really boring .
__de__ But then I found I could do this because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; I mentioned the doubt that he was having .
__de__ And because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t weird .
__de__ That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a weird thing .
__de__ And again , and again , I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have before I ask the question , I gained their trust .
__de__ People were more likely to say yes to me .
__de__ by asking .
__de__ But it has always been my dream to actually teach something .
__de__ But because I didn &apos;t run — I kept doing it — and on the third try the professor was very impressed .
__de__ He was like , &quot; &quot; No one has done this before . &quot; &quot; And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , I can use this .
__de__ Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll fit you in my curriculum . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was teaching a class .
__de__ You know , sometimes you get rejected by lighting , you know ?
__de__ I used to think I have to accomplish all these things — have to be a great entrepreneur , or get a PhD to teach — but no , I just asked , and I could teach .
__de__ And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quoted Martin Luther King , Jr .
__de__ Why ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections .
__de__ People like Martin Luther King , Jr . , like Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela , or even Jesus Christ .
__de__ These people did not let rejection define them .
__de__ They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves .
__de__ And they embraced rejection .
__de__ Then I started embracing it .
__de__ I turned that into the biggest gift in my life .
__de__ I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities .
__de__ I use my blog , I use my talk , I use the book I just published , and I &apos;m even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection .
__de__ When you get rejected in life , when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure , consider the possibilities .
__de__ Don &apos;t run .
__de__ If you just embrace them , they might become your gifts as well .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ So I guess I was the lucky one .
__de__ My mother had 16 pregnancies .
__de__ From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
__de__ You can imagine as a child what I went through .
__de__ I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
__de__ Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dormitory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
__de__ So as a result , my father sent me to America .
__de__ I came to America .
__de__ And do you know that at the time I was completing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
__de__ There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
__de__ My family was in a refugee camp .
__de__ So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
__de__ I wanted them to be safe .
__de__ But where was my heart ?
__de__ My heart was in Afghanistan .
__de__ I had a good job .
__de__ I could live with them .
__de__ I wanted to go back home .
__de__ So I went to the refugee camp .
__de__ I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
__de__ So it was a very devastating situation .
__de__ At that moment , we talk about momentum .
__de__ At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
__de__ How could I help these people ?
__de__ It transformed me . It gave me status .
__de__ But do you think it was easy ?
__de__ No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
__de__ Somebody who comes from the United States .
__de__ So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
__de__ How am I going to do that ?
__de__ I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
__de__ I asked .
__de__ Finally , I found one man .
__de__ He was 80 years old .
__de__ He was a mullah .
__de__ I went to his tent in the camp , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
__de__ one day I was in the office in Peshawar , Pakistan .
__de__ You &apos;re scared . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
__de__ You have to hold it together and show strength .
__de__ So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
__de__ So I invited them to the office .
__de__ They came , and there were nine of them — nine Taliban .
__de__ They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
__de__ They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
__de__ But also I was strong , holding myself up .
__de__ The only thing you could see , my eyes .
__de__ They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
__de__ We have some students coming , and they are all learning Koran , Holy Book .
__de__ By that time , my staff poured into my office .
__de__ They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
__de__ Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
__de__ We opened women &apos;s learning center .
__de__ We worked with mothers and children .
__de__ I was very happy . I was delighted with the outcome of my work .
__de__ And by that time , the women are yelling and screaming inside the car .
__de__ I am very shaken up , and I told myself , this is it .
__de__ There is no doubt in my mind .
__de__ You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
__de__ So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
__de__ My leg was shaking , and I got outside .
__de__ And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
__de__ They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
__de__ The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gun and kill .
__de__ It &apos;s a trap to me , of course .
__de__ They ran away home . Nobody stayed there .
__de__ My bodyguard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
__de__ I was shaken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
__de__ Hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
__de__ And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; And I answered her .
__de__ &quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
__de__ I told her the whole story .
__de__ At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
__de__ You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same route , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car .
__de__ So we stopped the car .
__de__ I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
__de__ Today , they are the best trainers .
__de__ So we are continuously giving training to men , and I really believe strongly .
__de__ I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
__de__ I just want to share this with you .
__de__ We were going everywhere .
__de__ We never locked our doors .
__de__ But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
__de__ Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
__de__ They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
__de__ They are training to be doctors , back again .
__de__ So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
__de__ We have one poet , Mawlānā Rūmī .
__de__ And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
__de__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__de__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__de__ Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
__de__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__de__ They kill our livestock .
__de__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__de__ My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__de__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__de__ The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__de__ So they kill the lions .
__de__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__de__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__de__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__de__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__de__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__de__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
__de__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__de__ And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
__de__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
__de__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__de__ So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__de__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__de__ So I had an idea .
__de__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
__de__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__de__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__de__ So I set up everything .
__de__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
__de__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__de__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__de__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__de__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__de__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__de__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__de__ One of them was this grandmother .
__de__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__de__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__de__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__de__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__de__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__de__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__de__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__de__ And here I am today .
__de__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__de__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__de__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__de__ Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__de__ So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
__de__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__de__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__de__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
__de__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__de__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
__de__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
__de__ Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
__de__ Disappears right into the background .
__de__ So , he &apos;s bluffing . Let &apos;s do it backwards .
__de__ One , two , three .
__de__ Server : May I help you , sir ?
__de__ Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .
__de__ Server : We have pan seared registry error sprinkled with the finest corrupted data , binary brioche , RAM sandwiches , Conficker fitters , and a scripting salad with or without polymorphic dressing , and a grilled coding kabob .
__de__ Customer : I &apos;d like a RAM sandwich and a glass of your finest Code 39 .
__de__ Server : Would you like any desserts , sir ?
__de__ Our special is tracking cookie .
__de__ Customer : I &apos;d like a batch of some zombie tracking cookies , thank you .
__de__ Server : Coming right up , sir .
__de__ Your food will be served shortly .
__de__ ( Applause ) Maya Penn : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon , and I &apos;ve been making animated flip books since I was three years old .
__de__ At that age , I also learned about what an animator was .
__de__ There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
__de__ When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life .
__de__ Animation and art has always been my first love .
__de__ It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
__de__ Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
__de__ And thus , &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; &quot; was born .
__de__ At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
__de__ That started my love for technology .
__de__ I built my first website myself in HTML , and I &apos;m learning JavaScript and Python .
__de__ I &apos;m also working on an animated series called &quot; &quot; The Pollinators . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
__de__ If plants aren &apos;t pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
__de__ So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
__de__ ( Applause ) ( Foot stomp ) ( Music ) ( Roar ) Pollinator : Deforestsaurus ! I should have known !
__de__ I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
__de__ ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my animations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
__de__ Ideas can spark a movement .
__de__ Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
__de__ Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
__de__ If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
__de__ At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya &apos;s Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya &apos;s Ideas for the Planet .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
__de__ I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
__de__ I was greatly influenced by art , and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did , even my business .
__de__ I would find different fabrics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scarf or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for designs .
__de__ I noticed when I wore my creations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
__de__ And I thought , I can start my own business .
__de__ Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
__de__ I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
__de__ My mom taught me how to sew , and on my back porch , I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon , and I would write down the names and the price of each item .
__de__ I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
__de__ Soon , my items began selling all over the world , and I had customers in Denmark , Italy , Australia , Canada and more .
__de__ Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
__de__ Soon , my business really started to take off .
__de__ Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
__de__ ( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
__de__ Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
__de__ I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
__de__ My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
__de__ I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
__de__ For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
__de__ These actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it .
__de__ So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
__de__ ( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
__de__ I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
__de__ We live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
__de__ But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
__de__ It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
__de__ That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
__de__ Thank you , and peace and blessings .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : So , you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
__de__ Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just — Ah !
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
__de__ Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
__de__ And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
__de__ We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
__de__ We go through initiation rites .
__de__ We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
__de__ But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
__de__ And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
__de__ All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
__de__ And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
__de__ Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
__de__ And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
__de__ The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
__de__ It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
__de__ And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
__de__ No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
__de__ And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
__de__ When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
__de__ Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
__de__ A language is a flash of the human spirit .
__de__ It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
__de__ Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
__de__ And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
__de__ They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
__de__ What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
__de__ And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
__de__ And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
__de__ Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
__de__ And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
__de__ Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
__de__ Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
__de__ Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
__de__ They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
__de__ And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
__de__ They simply listen and then begin to speak .
__de__ Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
__de__ In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
__de__ They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
__de__ They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
__de__ But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
__de__ They speared each other .
__de__ 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
__de__ We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
__de__ Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
__de__ In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
__de__ In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
__de__ On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
__de__ It &apos;s interesting .
__de__ If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
__de__ Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
__de__ There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
__de__ But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
__de__ So , the living give birth to the spirits .
__de__ The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
__de__ That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
__de__ We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?
__de__ So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
__de__ Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
__de__ Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
__de__ In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
__de__ To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
__de__ The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
__de__ And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
__de__ And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
__de__ It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
__de__ Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
__de__ Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
__de__ Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
__de__ There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
__de__ Now , what does that mean ?
__de__ It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
__de__ Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
__de__ What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
__de__ I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
__de__ That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
__de__ Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
__de__ It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
__de__ This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
__de__ What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
__de__ This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__de__ If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__de__ To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
__de__ In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes — who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
__de__ They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
__de__ Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
__de__ How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
__de__ Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
__de__ But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
__de__ This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
__de__ And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
__de__ I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
__de__ Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
__de__ Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
__de__ All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
__de__ And the problem is not technology itself .
__de__ The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
__de__ It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
__de__ Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
__de__ to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
__de__ Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
__de__ You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
__de__ And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
__de__ I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
__de__ This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
__de__ That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
__de__ His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
__de__ His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
__de__ He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
__de__ The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
__de__ One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
__de__ The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
__de__ And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
__de__ Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
__de__ And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
__de__ The Neolithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago .
__de__ The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
__de__ Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
__de__ When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
__de__ And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
__de__ This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
__de__ The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
__de__ This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
__de__ The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
__de__ Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
__de__ The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
__de__ So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
__de__ He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
__de__ He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
__de__ He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
__de__ Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
__de__ The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
__de__ It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
__de__ It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
__de__ An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
__de__ And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
__de__ They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
__de__ They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
__de__ So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
__de__ We think that polemics — ( Applause ) — we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
__de__ 156 nations carry our television channel .
__de__ Our magazines are read by millions .
__de__ And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__de__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__de__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
__de__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__de__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__de__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__de__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__de__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__de__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__de__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__de__ But we could keep that idea around the trees .
__de__ There are three trees popping through .
__de__ And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
__de__ But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
__de__ They fall into the net .
__de__ And you get more , and more , more .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
__de__ The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
__de__ Monkeys in the zoo .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Feeding time .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
__de__ And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
__de__ And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
__de__ You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
__de__ ( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
__de__ And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
__de__ So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
__de__ And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
__de__ So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
__de__ When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
__de__ But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
__de__ Because there is no boundary .
__de__ And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
__de__ He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
__de__ But here , just they leave and come back .
__de__ It &apos;s a natural process .
__de__ And secondly , we consider noise very important .
__de__ You know that children sleep better in noise .
__de__ They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
__de__ And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
__de__ And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
__de__ They need noise .
__de__ And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
__de__ You are not supposed to be in silence .
__de__ You know , it &apos;s completely open .
__de__ And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
__de__ In summer you go swimming .
__de__ The sand is 50 degrees .
__de__ And also , you should know that you are waterproof .
__de__ You never melt in rain .
__de__ So , children are supposed to be outside .
__de__ So that is how we should treat them .
__de__ This is how they divide classrooms .
__de__ They are supposed to help teachers .
__de__ They don &apos;t .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
__de__ A classroom .
__de__ And a washbasin .
__de__ They talk to each other around the well .
__de__ And there are always some trees in the classroom .
__de__ A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
__de__ And each classroom has at least one skylight .
__de__ And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
__de__ This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
__de__ The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
__de__ And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
__de__ So you have to consider safety .
__de__ So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
__de__ They tried to go in .
__de__ He hit his head .
__de__ He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
__de__ He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
__de__ And then we put other children .
__de__ The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo , as you know .
__de__ ( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
__de__ Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
__de__ And the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
__de__ So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
__de__ And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
__de__ But the surprise is yet to come .
__de__ The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
__de__ And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
__de__ The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
__de__ My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
__de__ They need to get some injury .
__de__ And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
__de__ And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
__de__ They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
__de__ They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
__de__ So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
__de__ Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
__de__ And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
__de__ And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big .
__de__ So , how big ?
__de__ Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
__de__ And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
__de__ Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
__de__ It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
__de__ But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
__de__ They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
__de__ And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
__de__ might be answered by studying these systems .
__de__ So that was very big .
__de__ The second things is very hot .
__de__ Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
__de__ This is in false color .
__de__ It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
__de__ And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
__de__ The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
__de__ And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
__de__ The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
__de__ So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
__de__ Third thing : probing the very small .
__de__ Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
__de__ Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
__de__ You were lied to .
__de__ Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
__de__ Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
__de__ If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
__de__ And dark matter is no exception .
__de__ Well , how do we do this ?
__de__ To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
__de__ Here is an image .
__de__ Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
__de__ They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
__de__ The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
__de__ What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
__de__ And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
__de__ So , it &apos;s very funny .
__de__ The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
__de__ Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
__de__ Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
__de__ Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
__de__ If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
__de__ What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
__de__ Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
__de__ They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
__de__ They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
__de__ And , again , we want to learn more about it .
__de__ So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
__de__ Depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
__de__ Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
__de__ Here is a computer simulation .
__de__ And we need a way to simplify it .
__de__ Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
__de__ The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
__de__ So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
__de__ I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
__de__ Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
__de__ He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
__de__ And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
__de__ They are not faster horses .
__de__ They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
__de__ So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
__de__ And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .

__de__ Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
__de__ At the time , I was cardiologist at UCLA , specializing in cardiac imaging techniques .
__de__ The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__de__ An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
__de__ Now , to be clear , North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified , board-certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients .
__de__ And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__de__ And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
__de__ Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients : congestive heart failure , brain tumors , leukemia , diabetes , arthritis , ALS , breast cancer , even psychiatric syndromes like depression , anxiety , compulsions , eating disorders and self-injury .
__de__ Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
__de__ So I started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
__de__ Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever attended a veterinary conference ?
__de__ For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
__de__ I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
__de__ Every medication that we prescribe or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
__de__ Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban .
__de__ You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
__de__ Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology .
__de__ And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles .
__de__ But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
__de__ But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
__de__ I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook .
__de__ I feel that tug of human exceptionalism , even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
__de__ Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
__de__ When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
__de__ And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
__de__ Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
__de__ Fear-induced heart failure .
__de__ Around the year 2000 , human cardiologists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
__de__ It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life &apos;s savings with a roll of the dice , in a bride who &apos;d been left at the alter .
__de__ But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
__de__ Self-injury .
__de__ Some human patients harm themselves .
__de__ Some pluck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
__de__ Some animal patients also harm themselves .
__de__ There are birds that pluck out feathers .
__de__ There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
__de__ Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis .
__de__ Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic .
__de__ Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large .
__de__ To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laundry .
__de__ Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D. &apos; s .
__de__ I &apos;m talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
__de__ So I don &apos;t blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession &apos;s condescension and ignorance .
__de__ But here &apos;s one from the vets : What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) .
__de__ Can geographic information make you healthy ?
__de__ In 2001 I got hit by a train .
__de__ My train was a heart attack .
__de__ I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
__de__ And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
__de__ I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
__de__ &quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
__de__ So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
__de__ Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
__de__ That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
__de__ Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
__de__ And you know why I understand that ?
__de__ Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
__de__ Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
__de__ I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
__de__ But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
__de__ What does that mean , my environment ?
__de__ Well , it can mean a lot of things .
__de__ This is my life . These are my life places .
__de__ We all have these .
__de__ While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
__de__ Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
__de__ And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
__de__ You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
__de__ And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
__de__ So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
__de__ And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
__de__ And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
__de__ Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
__de__ I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
__de__ I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
__de__ You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
__de__ And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
__de__ So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
__de__ OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
__de__ Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
__de__ They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
__de__ Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
__de__ And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
__de__ It was insidious and it was really happening .
__de__ Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
__de__ And I moved to Redlands California .
__de__ Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
__de__ Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
__de__ Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
__de__ If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
__de__ So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
__de__ Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
__de__ The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
__de__ No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
__de__ They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
__de__ They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
__de__ Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
__de__ This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
__de__ Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
__de__ Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
__de__ So , how many people are in the white ?
__de__ How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
__de__ Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
__de__ How many have spent it in the red places ?
__de__ Oh , not so lucky .
__de__ There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
__de__ They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
__de__ But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
__de__ And it &apos;s not in yours either .
__de__ So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
__de__ He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
__de__ And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
__de__ And this is where he has spent most of his time .
__de__ If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
__de__ Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
__de__ We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
__de__ And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
__de__ Did you know that data existed ?
__de__ For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
__de__ So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
__de__ This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
__de__ This might be what we end up with .
__de__ This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
__de__ This could be my little assessment .
__de__ And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
__de__ I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
__de__ Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
__de__ It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
__de__ And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
__de__ These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
__de__ The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
__de__ It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
__de__ But it will also be useful for us .
__de__ I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
__de__ Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
__de__ With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
__de__ Just look at that for a minute .
__de__ That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
__de__ That was what he was talking about on that quote .
__de__ And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
__de__ So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
__de__ So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
__de__ And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
__de__ When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
__de__ But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
__de__ After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
__de__ It is not important if I like the job or not .
__de__ But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
__de__ That is me playing my imaginary piano .
__de__ An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
__de__ I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
__de__ But no adults liked the idea .
__de__ No adults believed I was serious .
__de__ Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
__de__ So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
__de__ My dream would never come true .
__de__ I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
__de__ But that &apos;s so unfair .
__de__ So I was determined to find another calling .
__de__ Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
__de__ I turned to books .
__de__ I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
__de__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
__de__ Books banned in China , of course .
__de__ &quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
__de__ That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
__de__ The Bible is interesting , but strange .
__de__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
__de__ But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
__de__ &quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
__de__ Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
__de__ It offers many insights .
__de__ For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
__de__ It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
__de__ A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
__de__ Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
__de__ It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
__de__ There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
__de__ Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
__de__ So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
__de__ So I started reading books in pairs .
__de__ So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
__de__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
__de__ For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
__de__ For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
__de__ So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
__de__ &#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
__de__ For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !
__de__ &quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
__de__ I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
__de__ Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
__de__ I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
__de__ Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
__de__ Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
__de__ So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
__de__ So may books be always with you .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high speeds .
__de__ That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
__de__ I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vuvuzela , weird jokes about octopi .
__de__ But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stressing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
__de__ It &apos;s been a major trending topic .
__de__ Being a monolingual American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
__de__ So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
__de__ They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
__de__ In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
__de__ Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
__de__ Every year , more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades .
__de__ Ethan Zuckerman : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
__de__ It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
__de__ Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao .
__de__ And it &apos;s terribly endangered .
__de__ The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Brazilian friends tell me — is pitching in to help out .
__de__ It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
__de__ Now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
__de__ In Portugese , it means &quot; &quot; Shut your mouth , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refers to this guy , Galvao Bueno , who &apos;s the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo .
__de__ And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
__de__ He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again .
__de__ So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea , put up this banner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
__de__ Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
__de__ And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
__de__ So as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
__de__ The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter .
__de__ There &apos;s more than five million of them .
__de__ As far as national representation , 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter .
__de__ That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
__de__ Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
__de__ Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
__de__ Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
__de__ And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
__de__ And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space .
__de__ It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space .
__de__ Twitter recently did some research .
__de__ They looked at their local population .
__de__ They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
__de__ That &apos;s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population .
__de__ And again , that was very shocking to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
__de__ And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .
__de__ And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations .
__de__ This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
__de__ It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that cookout is a mostly black conversation .
__de__ And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
__de__ You click on that cookout tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it .
__de__ But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
__de__ We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend Eli Pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
__de__ And we tend not to see that wider picture .
__de__ Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
__de__ If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Being Digital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
__de__ Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
__de__ He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
__de__ And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of Evian water on the table .
__de__ And Negroponte says this is crazy .
__de__ This is the old economy .
__de__ It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
__de__ We &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is speedy , it &apos;s weightless .
__de__ It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
__de__ And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
__de__ Now , Negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
__de__ He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
__de__ It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
__de__ If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in Fiji , shipped at great expense to the United States .
__de__ It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film .
__de__ It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music .
__de__ It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fiji .
__de__ There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
__de__ There &apos;s crackdowns on the press .
__de__ It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
__de__ Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
__de__ I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
__de__ We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
__de__ And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like airline routes .
__de__ It includes things like the Internet cables .
__de__ We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
__de__ You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bangalore later today .
__de__ Two hops , you &apos;re in Suva , the capitol of Fiji .
__de__ It &apos;s all right there .
__de__ When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
__de__ You start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
__de__ It &apos;s extremely lumpy .
__de__ There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
__de__ There &apos;s basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York .
__de__ but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
__de__ You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
__de__ And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
__de__ When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
__de__ So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
__de__ The world is , in fact , getting more global .
__de__ It &apos;s getting more connected .
__de__ More of problems are global in scale .
__de__ More of our economics is global in scale .
__de__ And our media is less global by the day .
__de__ If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
__de__ That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
__de__ And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world .
__de__ Here &apos;s a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk .
__de__ Alisa &apos;s the president of Public Radio International .
__de__ And she made a cartogram , which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month .
__de__ And you see that when you distort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S.
__de__ and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
__de__ And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
__de__ And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dreadful , and I agree that it &apos;s dreadful — I &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
__de__ When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
__de__ It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
__de__ Here &apos;s a map made by Mark Graham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
__de__ A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded .
__de__ And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
__de__ Even within Wikipedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
__de__ In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
__de__ You probably won &apos;t .
__de__ If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites .
__de__ It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
__de__ So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism .
__de__ We look at the internet .
__de__ We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
__de__ We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
__de__ And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red Sox scores .
__de__ So this is a real problem — not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
__de__ This is a problem we have to solve .
__de__ So here &apos;s the good news .
__de__ For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
__de__ This is a group called Global Voices .
__de__ This is a team of bloggers from around the world .
__de__ Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
__de__ We started in 2004 .
__de__ You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
__de__ Nor do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
__de__ But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
__de__ The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
__de__ In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
__de__ And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
__de__ What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encouragement .
__de__ One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
__de__ And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
__de__ They were doing something much simpler .
__de__ It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
__de__ but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
__de__ Most independent media was shut down .
__de__ And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
__de__ So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
__de__ Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak Malagasy .
__de__ I &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
__de__ Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
__de__ If you &apos;re using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page .
__de__ Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine translation of the page .
__de__ And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dreadful with Chinese .
__de__ And the results can be pretty funny .
__de__ What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this .
__de__ And if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
__de__ There &apos;s a group right now in China called Yeeyan .
__de__ And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
__de__ They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
__de__ They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
__de__ They put it online for free .
__de__ It &apos;s the project of a guy named Zhang Lei , who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
__de__ And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Yeeyan ?
__de__ Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
__de__ My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
__de__ So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guarantee that we &apos;re going to find it .
__de__ When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
__de__ We use a lot of search .
__de__ And search is terrific if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
__de__ But if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
__de__ What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
__de__ The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
__de__ You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
__de__ And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
__de__ To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
__de__ You need a guide .
__de__ So this is Amira Al Hussaini . She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices .
__de__ She has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
__de__ Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
__de__ And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of Ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
__de__ She has to know something about what stories are available .
__de__ Basically , she &apos;s a deejay .
__de__ She &apos;s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
__de__ I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
__de__ I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience .
__de__ I know Amira .
__de__ I can ask her what to read .
__de__ But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
__de__ And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
__de__ So once you start widening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start translating , once you start curating , you end up in some really weird places .
__de__ This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is AfriGadget .
__de__ And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
__de__ And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel .
__de__ And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conceivably care about this ? &quot;
__de__ And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
__de__ This is Erik Hersman . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
__de__ He goes by the moniker White African .
__de__ He &apos;s both a very well known American geek , but he &apos;s also Kenyan ; he was born in Sudan , grew up in Kenya .
__de__ He is a bridge figure .
__de__ He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
__de__ And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
__de__ He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
__de__ These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
__de__ But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
__de__ And that &apos;s where we start talking about xenophiles .
__de__ So if I found myself in the NFL , I suspect I would spend my off-season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hip-hop album .
__de__ Dhani Jones , who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
__de__ Dhani has a television show .
__de__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , Dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
__de__ He finds a local sporting team .
__de__ He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
__de__ And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing .
__de__ It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
__de__ For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
__de__ For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
__de__ But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
__de__ The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia .
__de__ My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TEDGlobal — is that most of you are xenophiles , whether or not you use that term .
__de__ My challenge instead is this .
__de__ It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
__de__ We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have .
__de__ We have to fix our media .
__de__ We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
__de__ We have to fix our immigration policy .
__de__ We need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
__de__ And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
__de__ That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
__de__ And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity .
__de__ It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
__de__ What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
__de__ The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
__de__ So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emptying out .
__de__ The question is , why ?
__de__ And here &apos;s the unromantic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
__de__ And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
__de__ They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
__de__ They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
__de__ They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
__de__ One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
__de__ They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
__de__ Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
__de__ What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
__de__ Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
__de__ There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
__de__ One-sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
__de__ So here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
__de__ And here &apos;s the second punch line .
__de__ That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
__de__ Stars have shined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
__de__ Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
__de__ Guess who was the performing guest ?
__de__ Susan Boyle .
__de__ And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
__de__ It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
__de__ Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
__de__ That was hilarious .
__de__ So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
__de__ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
__de__ And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
__de__ Well , being different is not that difficult .
__de__ We are all different from different perspectives .
__de__ But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
__de__ You may have the chance to make a difference .
__de__ My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
__de__ I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton — it &apos;s still there .
__de__ So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
__de__ That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
__de__ Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
__de__ The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
__de__ So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
__de__ Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
__de__ But actually , they were impressed by my words .
__de__ And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
__de__ After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
__de__ So I was on a national television prime-time show .
__de__ And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
__de__ ( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
__de__ Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
__de__ So we do a lot of things .
__de__ I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
__de__ And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
__de__ But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
__de__ I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
__de__ I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
__de__ I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
__de__ But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
__de__ How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
__de__ So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
__de__ First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
__de__ Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei — 20 years old , beautiful .
__de__ She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
__de__ And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
__de__ She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
__de__ The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
__de__ So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
__de__ All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
__de__ It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
__de__ But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
__de__ It is still boiling .
__de__ It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
__de__ And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
__de__ Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
__de__ Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
__de__ On Tencent , 200 million .
__de__ The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
__de__ About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
__de__ And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
__de__ But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
__de__ So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
__de__ So how are they different ?
__de__ First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
__de__ And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
__de__ That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
__de__ Most of them have fairly good education .
__de__ The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
__de__ In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
__de__ But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
__de__ And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
__de__ So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
__de__ So making a living is not that easy for young people .
__de__ College graduates are not in short supply .
__de__ In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
__de__ So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
__de__ That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
__de__ Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
__de__ They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
__de__ Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
__de__ They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
__de__ And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
__de__ Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
__de__ But they died because of all different personal reasons .
__de__ But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
__de__ For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
__de__ So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
__de__ These diagrams show a more general social background .
__de__ The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
__de__ But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
__de__ The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
__de__ Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
__de__ And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
__de__ And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
__de__ So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
__de__ So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
__de__ Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
__de__ For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
__de__ And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
__de__ Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
__de__ So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
__de__ So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
__de__ Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
__de__ We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
__de__ And guess what , we have faked beef .
__de__ They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
__de__ And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
__de__ So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
__de__ And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
__de__ While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
__de__ China is soon to pass the U.S.
__de__ as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
__de__ But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
__de__ They &apos;re not rich at all .
__de__ They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
__de__ And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
__de__ But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
__de__ So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
__de__ It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
__de__ And also , people are doing good through social media .
__de__ And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
__de__ People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
__de__ And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
__de__ And here also people are helping to find missing children .
__de__ A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
__de__ After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
__de__ So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
__de__ Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
__de__ People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
__de__ How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
__de__ And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
__de__ I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
__de__ And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Isn &apos;t it nice ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; phew .
__de__ ( Applause ) Having brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , shocking news for me .
__de__ I knew nothing about cancer .
__de__ And everyone changes as well .
__de__ They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
__de__ People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease , instead of with the human being .
__de__ They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doctor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; And in the meanwhile , you &apos;re left with questions to which nobody gives an answer .
__de__ These are the &quot; &quot; Can I ? &quot; &quot; questions : Can I work while I have cancer ?
__de__ Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
__de__ And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?
__de__ Are there any other options ? &quot; &quot; And , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios , because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you .
__de__ But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who waits . &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) Things are changing , but classically , they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition , to get your friends and family engaged , or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going through .
__de__ But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
__de__ While I was in the hospital , I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it .
__de__ It was really hard to obtain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
__de__ I talked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me .
__de__ There &apos;s more to me .
__de__ A cure , whichever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital against medical advice .
__de__ I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery .
__de__ So I created a website , which is called La Cura , on which I put my medical data , online .
__de__ I actually had to hack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I chose this word , La Cura — La Cura in Italian means &quot; &quot; the cure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things .
__de__ I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure .
__de__ And , it worked .
__de__ The La Cura website went viral .
__de__ For example , here we see Francesca Fini in her performance .
__de__ Or , as artist Patrick Lichty has done : He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse .
__de__ Now you can have my cancer , too !
__de__ ( Laughter ) Which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
__de__ And this was going on — scientists , the traditional medicine experts , several researchers , doctors — all connected with me to give advice .
__de__ And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
__de__ And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
__de__ &#91; Surgery &#93; The follow-up MRIs showed , luckily , little to no growth of the cancer .
__de__ So I was able to take my time and choose .
__de__ I chose the doctor I wanted to work with , I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in , and in the meanwhile , I was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt pity for me .
__de__ What are the outcomes ?
__de__ ( Applause ) I had excellent news after the surgery — I have — I had a very low-grade glioma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot .
__de__ I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
__de__ Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged .
__de__ And right before the operation , we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor , to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid .
__de__ Obviously , there were .
__de__ &#91; Open &#93; And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura .
__de__ Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
__de__ Doctors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usually consult when they think about cancer .
__de__ I &apos;m a self-founding , continuous state of translation among many different languages , in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research .
__de__ &#91; Society &#93; The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components .
__de__ This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) .
__de__ A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
__de__ Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
__de__ My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re honest lies .
__de__ Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand .
__de__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Truth . Lies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , boom .
__de__ We &apos;ve got truth and lies and then there &apos;s this little space , the edge , in the middle .
__de__ All right . Venn diagram . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very helpful either .
__de__ I used to be a summer camp counselor .
__de__ I would tell them about how , on the weekends , I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England .
__de__ You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question .
__de__ In my fantasy , they were svelte Russian women , but , you know , four-year-olds — you take what you can get in Berkeley , California .
__de__ And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
__de__ And so Riley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
__de__ And Riley knew she didn &apos;t grow a melon in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
__de__ It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
__de__ I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
__de__ It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
__de__ Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
__de__ Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sherlock Holmes &apos; apartment , even though 221B is just a number that was painted on a building that never actually had that address .
__de__ and yet we also know that they are .
__de__ Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can , and that &apos;s why I love writing for kids .
__de__ And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
__de__ I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s closet doors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mom &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s closet , and there was not a secret magical land there .
__de__ There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
__de__ They have eyepatches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s springtime , pirates want to go wild .
__de__ It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
__de__ So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
__de__ So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
__de__ There &apos;s our Employees of the Month , including Genghis Khan , Charles Dickens .
__de__ Some great people have come up through our ranks .
__de__ This is our kind of pharmacy section .
__de__ Our architect was covered in red syrup .
__de__ Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
__de__ Dead languages .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
__de__ And Viking Odorant , which comes in lots of great scents : toenails , sweat and rotten vegetables , pyre ash .
__de__ There &apos;s a term called metafiction , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and meta &apos;s having a moment now .
__de__ Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis , but it &apos;s been around .
__de__ I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
__de__ And so I try to do this in my books .
__de__ And here &apos;s just one example .
__de__ This is the first book that I ever made .
__de__ So it &apos;s delivered overnight by FedUp .
__de__ He lives in San Francisco — very tough city to own a blue whale in .
__de__ A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
__de__ This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
__de__ And kids do write in .
__de__ And they get a picture of their whale too .
__de__ So this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Nico &apos;s message .
__de__ This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
__de__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
__de__ I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
__de__ So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . Bye .
__de__ Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
__de__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
__de__ I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
__de__ MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
__de__ He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
__de__ This is the Christmas message from Nico .
__de__ &#91; Beep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
__de__ His voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
__de__ But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Phew , phew , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Usually when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scream out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
__de__ And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( Vvvwow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Whoa ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
__de__ Well , what I &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
__de__ See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets — ( Portamento ) — and you can get it really low .
__de__ And with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
__de__ ( Tones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
__de__ ( Flourish ... Beep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I startle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( Blip ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
__de__ Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
__de__ We &apos;re going to do a song by David Mash called &quot; &quot; Listen : the Words Are Gone , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ; there are so many .
__de__ And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin .
__de__ It was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , Léon Theremin — he also was a musician besides an inventor — he came up with the idea for making the theremin , I think , when he was working on some shortwave radios .
__de__ And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( Screeching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pitches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now .
__de__ And a lot of times , even kids nowadays , they &apos;ll make reference to a theremin by going , &quot; &quot; Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
__de__ And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibrato gets out of hand .
__de__ You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
__de__ You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
__de__ It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
__de__ And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( Tone rising out of key ) — and breathing will make it ...
__de__ ( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
__de__ I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
__de__ And if I go to a club and play a gig , people are like , &quot; Here , have some drinks on us ! &quot;
__de__ And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Teetering tones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
__de__ it &apos;s similar to being a vocalist , except instead of it coming out of your throat , you &apos;re controlling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ; you &apos;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .
__de__ You just have to always adjust to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
__de__ I think we will play another tune now .
__de__ I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; Lush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
__de__ I feel so fortunate .
__de__ I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
__de__ But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
__de__ I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
__de__ Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
__de__ And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
__de__ She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
__de__ But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
__de__ Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
__de__ And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
__de__ And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
__de__ It all started back in 1977 .
__de__ I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
__de__ And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
__de__ So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
__de__ And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention — kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
__de__ And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
__de__ And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
__de__ There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
__de__ Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
__de__ She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
__de__ There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
__de__ And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
__de__ So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
__de__ His name is Chris Farina .
__de__ Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
__de__ Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
__de__ ( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
__de__ He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
__de__ Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
__de__ So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
__de__ It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
__de__ And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
__de__ And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the eerie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
__de__ What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
__de__ I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
__de__ That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
__de__ I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
__de__ And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
__de__ And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
__de__ And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
__de__ And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
__de__ You know the one .
__de__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
__de__ I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
__de__ And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
__de__ And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
__de__ My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
__de__ That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
__de__ And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
__de__ And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
__de__ I am one of her teaching gestures .
__de__ And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
__de__ And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
__de__ It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
__de__ And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
__de__ I &apos;m not here alone .
__de__ There are many people on this stage right now .
__de__ And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
__de__ It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
__de__ I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
__de__ We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
__de__ I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
__de__ I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
__de__ So I thought , well they like to play games .
__de__ I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 — but something interactive .
__de__ And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
__de__ And it has four Plexiglass layers .
__de__ There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
__de__ There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
__de__ There are four countries around the board .
__de__ The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
__de__ They have different assets , commercial and military .
__de__ And each country has a cabinet .
__de__ There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
__de__ I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
__de__ I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
__de__ There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
__de__ There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
__de__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
__de__ And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
__de__ So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
__de__ I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
__de__ And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
__de__ There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
__de__ If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
__de__ So I also have in the game a saboteur — some child — it &apos;s basically a troublemaker — and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
__de__ But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
__de__ And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
__de__ The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; Fourth-graders understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
__de__ They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
__de__ Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
__de__ And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
__de__ I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
__de__ I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
__de__ The students run the game .
__de__ I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
__de__ So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
__de__ ( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
__de__ You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
__de__ See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
__de__ John Hunter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
__de__ And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
__de__ And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
__de__ And so I apologize to them as well .
__de__ I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
__de__ Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
__de__ Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
__de__ ( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
__de__ ( Chatter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
__de__ It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
__de__ I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
__de__ So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
__de__ In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
__de__ And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
__de__ And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
__de__ Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
__de__ She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
__de__ And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
__de__ We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
__de__ This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her girlfriends she said that .
__de__ That &apos;s a breach there .
__de__ And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
__de__ And we were very upset .
__de__ I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
__de__ But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
__de__ So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
__de__ Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
__de__ She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
__de__ Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
__de__ That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
__de__ I could not have designed that in teaching it .
__de__ It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
__de__ ( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
__de__ We have a letter in the game .
__de__ If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
__de__ You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
__de__ So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
__de__ And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County — and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
__de__ It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
__de__ She read two sentences .
__de__ By the third sentence , she was in tears .
__de__ I was in tears .
__de__ Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
__de__ We all lose .
__de__ And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
__de__ I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
__de__ He &apos;s been in many battles .
__de__ ( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
__de__ I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
__de__ But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
__de__ One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
__de__ And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
__de__ JH : I get chills every time I see that .
__de__ That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
__de__ And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
__de__ But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
__de__ We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
__de__ We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
__de__ So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
__de__ This is about my friend Brennan .
__de__ We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
__de__ The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
__de__ Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
__de__ The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
__de__ He says , &quot; &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
__de__ So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
__de__ There was no way they could win .
__de__ And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time — there was about a minute left — and despair just settled over the room .
__de__ I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
__de__ I should have gotten it so they could have won .
__de__ They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
__de__ I &apos;ve failed them .
__de__ And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
__de__ And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
__de__ Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
__de__ They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
__de__ They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
__de__ I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
__de__ Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
__de__ The parents were looking in the window .
__de__ And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
__de__ He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
__de__ And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
__de__ We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
__de__ And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
__de__ Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
__de__ Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
__de__ Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
__de__ Every game we play is different .
__de__ Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
__de__ Some games are more about warfare .
__de__ But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
__de__ I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
__de__ And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
__de__ And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
__de__ If only .
__de__ And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
__de__ I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
__de__ He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
__de__ His village is near Mogadishu .
__de__ Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
__de__ With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .
__de__ When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
__de__ He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
__de__ Maybe a year passes , nothing .
__de__ One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
__de__ He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
__de__ He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
__de__ He is introduced to this young woman .
__de__ He eventually gets married .
__de__ He starts this new life .
__de__ He has a purpose in life .
__de__ One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
__de__ That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
__de__ So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
__de__ He was waiting .
__de__ He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
__de__ This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
__de__ And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
__de__ It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
__de__ For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
__de__ Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
__de__ By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
__de__ If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
__de__ And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
__de__ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
__de__ They pretty much do nothing .
__de__ I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Madina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
__de__ I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
__de__ What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood ?
__de__ Would I have become a terrorist ?
__de__ I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
__de__ My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .
__de__ I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
__de__ We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
__de__ One of the young men in the room was Aden .
__de__ He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
__de__ There were no jobs , no opportunities .
__de__ I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
__de__ They sought people like him out .
__de__ But his story takes a different route .
__de__ In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
__de__ Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around .
__de__ Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
__de__ He started a motorbike company .
__de__ He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
__de__ He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
__de__ How is this story different ?
__de__ What makes his story different ?
__de__ I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
__de__ It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
__de__ It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
__de__ And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
__de__ I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .
__de__ He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
__de__ He &apos;s actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad .
__de__ If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
__de__ for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
__de__ He started a landscaping and design floral company .
__de__ He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
__de__ And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
__de__ There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
__de__ He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
__de__ And he doesn &apos;t grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
__de__ So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
__de__ They had never really thought about starting up a business .
__de__ They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
__de__ He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
__de__ He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
__de__ By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
__de__ They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
__de__ So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
__de__ They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
__de__ Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
__de__ For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
__de__ It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
__de__ Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
__de__ I believe he is selling hope .
__de__ His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
__de__ Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him .
__de__ He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
__de__ These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
__de__ So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
__de__ I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
__de__ I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
__de__ So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burniss Travis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano . ( Applause )
__de__ So the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
__de__ It is really a sacred space .
__de__ And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
__de__ You really are alive right here in this moment .
__de__ There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand .
__de__ We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
__de__ In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Titi Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
__de__ Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
__de__ You have no time for projected ideas .
__de__ So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
__de__ So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the bandstand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
__de__ The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
__de__ Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
__de__ So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
__de__ So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
__de__ ( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F. ( Music )
__de__ See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
__de__ If you played an E.
__de__ See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
__de__ If you played an F # though , ( Dissonance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
__de__ So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
__de__ And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
__de__ And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
__de__ And we won &apos;t react to it .
__de__ He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
__de__ We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
__de__ ( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
__de__ The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
__de__ It was an opportunity that was missed .
__de__ So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
__de__ He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
__de__ We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
__de__ ( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
__de__ I ended up creating a melody out of it .
__de__ The texture changed in the drums this time .
__de__ It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
__de__ So there is no mistake .
__de__ The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
__de__ So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
__de__ It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
__de__ And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
__de__ We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
__de__ So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
__de__ Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
__de__ And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micromanage in jazz .
__de__ You have some people who do .
__de__ But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
__de__ If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
__de__ ready , just play some time .
__de__ One , two , one , two , three , four .
__de__ ( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
__de__ I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
__de__ This is a science of listening .
__de__ It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
__de__ So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
__de__ When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
__de__ Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
__de__ ( Music ) Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
__de__ It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
__de__ It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
__de__ It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__de__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
__de__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__de__ I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
__de__ So most everyone watches TV .
__de__ We like it . We like some parts of it .
__de__ Here in America , people actually love TV .
__de__ The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
__de__ Okay ?
__de__ Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
__de__ But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
__de__ They , in fact , berate it .
__de__ They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
__de__ My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
__de__ So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
__de__ So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
__de__ Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
__de__ We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
__de__ We &apos;re talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years .
__de__ How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
__de__ How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
__de__ Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
__de__ You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .
__de__ As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
__de__ We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
__de__ We feel awe , we feel pity .
__de__ That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
__de__ The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
__de__ We love to watch TV .
__de__ This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
__de__ Animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
__de__ So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
__de__ Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
__de__ I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
__de__ Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
__de__ So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
__de__ We went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
__de__ We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
__de__ We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
__de__ How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
__de__ Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
__de__ Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
__de__ What did this mean for you ?
__de__ So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
__de__ But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
__de__ And on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
__de__ So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
__de__ Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern .
__de__ And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen .
__de__ Okay , here we go .
__de__ So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
__de__ Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
__de__ Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
__de__ As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
__de__ That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
__de__ Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
__de__ Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane .
__de__ Why ?
__de__ The Cuban Missile Crisis , JFK is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , MLK is shot , Bobby Kennedy is shot , Watergate .
__de__ Look what happens .
__de__ In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
__de__ Moral ambiguity takes off .
__de__ They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a telegenic president , is in office .
__de__ It &apos;s trying to recover .
__de__ But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran-Contra , the Challenger disaster , Chernobyl .
__de__ Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
__de__ Take a look at this .
__de__ This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
__de__ But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
__de__ Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; Andy Griffith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
__de__ This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
__de__ Irreverence starts to rise .
__de__ Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
__de__ You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
__de__ You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gomer Pyle &quot; &quot; — in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
__de__ What &apos;s number one ?
__de__ The socially irreverent hippie show , &quot; Rowan and Martin &apos;s Laugh-In . &quot;
__de__ They &apos;re all living together , right .
__de__ Viewers had responded dramatically .
__de__ Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
__de__ When you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ?
__de__ It means in the 1966 television season , The &quot; &quot; Smothers Brothers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
__de__ This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presidency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
__de__ So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
__de__ In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
__de__ Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
__de__ Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
__de__ Now look at this .
__de__ The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
__de__ You have &quot; &quot; All in the Family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top-10 for the entire 70s — &quot; MAS * H. &quot;
__de__ In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration .
__de__ Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
__de__ It can make me feel this ?
__de__ It can change us ?
__de__ So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
__de__ Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
__de__ This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .
__de__ You &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
__de__ Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
__de__ No . In the 70s you have the bellwether show &quot; &quot; The Bionic Woman &quot; &quot; that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Million-Dollar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s Angels . &quot; &quot; Another spike in the 1980s — another spike in shows about control and power .
__de__ What were those shows ?
__de__ Glamorous and rich .
__de__ &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
__de__ Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
__de__ So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
__de__ Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
__de__ Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
__de__ The 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cheers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfeld . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
__de__ But look : X marks the spot .
__de__ In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succumbs to judgment once and for all .
__de__ Why not ?
__de__ We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
__de__ We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
__de__ We had 9 / 11 .
__de__ Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
__de__ Look what happens when we keep going .
__de__ At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
__de__ What do people want in their TV then ?
__de__ I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
__de__ Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
__de__ No , they want judgment .
__de__ I can vote you off the island .
__de__ I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
__de__ I can choose the next American Idol . You &apos;re fired .
__de__ That &apos;s all great , right ?
__de__ So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
__de__ We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
__de__ There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom .
__de__ The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Beaver . &quot; &quot; Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
__de__ Maude Findlay , the epitome of the irreverent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even menopause on TV .
__de__ The 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington .
__de__ Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .
__de__ This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
__de__ Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
__de__ So to you all , the women of TEDWomen , the men of TEDWomen , the global audiences of TEDWomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
__de__ But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
__de__ They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as viewers , through your collective social consciences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
__de__ So thanks very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
__de__ And I &apos;ll quote three people : Vannevar Bush , Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee .
__de__ So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
__de__ This is Vannevar Bush .
__de__ Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
__de__ And in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly .
__de__ And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
__de__ We don &apos;t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth .
__de__ The brain works by association .
__de__ With one item in its thought , it snaps instantly to the next item .
__de__ And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process .
__de__ And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
__de__ And the memex would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
__de__ Now this was in 1945 .
__de__ A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
__de__ And nobody knew anything about it .
__de__ So this was before the computer was invented .
__de__ And he proposed this machine called the memex .
__de__ And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
__de__ So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S. Air Force officer .
__de__ And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
__de__ And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
__de__ And by the mid-60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
__de__ He built a system .
__de__ The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
__de__ And in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called NLS for oN-Line System .
__de__ And this is Doug Engelbart .
__de__ He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968 .
__de__ What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstrated this system .
__de__ He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
__de__ And he works this system .
__de__ And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
__de__ And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
__de__ So this is where the mouse came from as well .
__de__ So this is Doug Engelbart .
__de__ The trouble with Doug Engelbart &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
__de__ So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
__de__ But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
__de__ And my company , OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh .
__de__ And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
__de__ And this began to get a head of steam .
__de__ Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
__de__ They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .
__de__ The magazines started to cover it .
__de__ Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext .
__de__ We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version .
__de__ And our PC version became quite mature .
__de__ These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
__de__ You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
__de__ We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html .
__de__ We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
__de__ And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks .
__de__ So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990 .
__de__ And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you Ian Ritchie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
__de__ And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
__de__ But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day .
__de__ And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
__de__ I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he &apos;s not going to do this .
__de__ So we didn &apos;t do it .
__de__ In the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
__de__ In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .
__de__ In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web .
__de__ And I saw it , and I thought , yep , that &apos;s it .
__de__ And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in Edinburgh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker .
__de__ So that puts me in pretty illustrious company .
__de__ There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles .
__de__ There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
__de__ And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling &apos;s Harry Potter , I guess .
__de__ On the other hand , there &apos;s Marc Andreessen who wrote the world &apos;s first browser for the World Wide Web .
__de__ And according to Fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
__de__ But is he happy ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
__de__ In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
__de__ And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
__de__ He was not a political prisoner .
__de__ He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
__de__ What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
__de__ And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
__de__ We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
__de__ It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
__de__ I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
__de__ First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
__de__ The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
__de__ And the third is commitment .
__de__ So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
__de__ Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
__de__ And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
__de__ My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
__de__ And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
__de__ The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
__de__ And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; inaudible name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; Khrew , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have defended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
__de__ And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
__de__ And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
__de__ She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
__de__ She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d miscarried .
__de__ And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
__de__ But Cambodia is not alone .
__de__ I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
__de__ Or is it other countries ?
__de__ But it is in so many countries .
__de__ In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
__de__ Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
__de__ And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
__de__ And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
__de__ A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
__de__ But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
__de__ For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; inaudible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mumbling
__de__ and grumbling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
__de__ The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
__de__ I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
__de__ What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
__de__ And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
__de__ I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . Lawyers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
__de__ Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
__de__ But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
__de__ So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
__de__ And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
__de__ And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
__de__ The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
__de__ It &apos;s not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
__de__ We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
__de__ So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
__de__ And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
__de__ And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
__de__ So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
__de__ And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
__de__ This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
__de__ So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
__de__ We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
__de__ But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
__de__ And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
__de__ Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
__de__ It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
__de__ Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
__de__ I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice .
__de__ Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
__de__ So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
__de__ So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
__de__ You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
__de__ Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
__de__ And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vishna . He &apos;s a 4-year-old boy .
__de__ He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
__de__ But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
__de__ And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ Doesn &apos;t say a word — just rolls away with it .
__de__ But there &apos;s no agenda .
__de__ There &apos;s no information about why you were invited to the meeting .
__de__ And yet you accept the meeting invitation , and you go .
__de__ And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
__de__ I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
__de__ Thousands of people wrote things like , &quot; OMG , that was my day today ! &quot;
__de__ &quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
__de__ &quot; This is my life . &quot;
__de__ It made me laugh until I cried .
__de__ And cried . And I cried some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My daily life until retirement or death , sigh . &quot;
__de__ A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings and suffer through these poorly run meetings and live to meet another day .
__de__ But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
__de__ In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
__de__ It &apos;s right at our fingertips , literally .
__de__ It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No MAS !
__de__ First of all , the next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , click the tentative button !
__de__ It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
__de__ It &apos;s right next to the accept button .
__de__ Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
__de__ Then , get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting .
__de__ Tell them you &apos;re very excited to support their work , ask them what the goal of the meeting is , and tell them you &apos;re interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal .
__de__ And if we do this often enough , and we do it respectfully , people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations .
__de__ And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
__de__ &quot; End with an inspiring call to action . &quot;
__de__ No .
__de__ Let me show you what I mean .
__de__ She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly , she &apos;s terrified .
__de__ Let &apos;s take a look inside Haley &apos;s brain for a moment .
__de__ There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle .
__de__ It &apos;s how you navigate the world .
__de__ Now , different people &apos;s worldviews can be dramatically different .
__de__ For example , how does your worldview react when you see this image : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you look at me ?
__de__ Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
__de__ Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
__de__ So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
__de__ I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
__de__ I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
__de__ So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
__de__ I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
__de__ And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
__de__ To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
__de__ One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
__de__ For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
__de__ This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
__de__ This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
__de__ This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
__de__ all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
__de__ So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
__de__ So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
__de__ One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
__de__ You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
__de__ Students lack perseverance .
__de__ They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
__de__ There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
__de__ And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
__de__ This is really destructive .
__de__ David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
__de__ He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
__de__ He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
__de__ You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
__de__ And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
__de__ I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
__de__ I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
__de__ I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
__de__ ( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
__de__ It applies equally to math .
__de__ Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
__de__ I believe in real life .
__de__ And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
__de__ I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
__de__ And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
__de__ When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
__de__ And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
__de__ You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
__de__ So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
__de__ Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
__de__ It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
__de__ But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
__de__ I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
__de__ You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
__de__ You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
__de__ So I hope you can see .
__de__ I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
__de__ That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
__de__ So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
__de__ So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
__de__ And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
__de__ So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
__de__ And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
__de__ And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
__de__ And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
__de__ And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
__de__ The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
__de__ And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
__de__ But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
__de__ Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
__de__ It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
__de__ And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
__de__ He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
__de__ So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
__de__ And here &apos;s how it works .
__de__ I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
__de__ The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
__de__ First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
__de__ Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
__de__ And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
__de__ None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
__de__ Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
__de__ Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
__de__ So now we have a water tank .
__de__ How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
__de__ And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
__de__ So now we have the real deal .
__de__ How long will it take it to fill it up ?
__de__ And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
__de__ And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
__de__ It &apos;s tedious .
__de__ Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
__de__ And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
__de__ And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
__de__ But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
__de__ Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
__de__ We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
__de__ And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
__de__ And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
__de__ We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
__de__ But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
__de__ So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
__de__ These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
__de__ We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
__de__ We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
__de__ This has been a lot of fun .
__de__ I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
__de__ And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
__de__ It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
__de__ I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
__de__ I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
__de__ Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
__de__ I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
__de__ And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
__de__ And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
__de__ Math makes sense of the world .
__de__ Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
__de__ So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
__de__ We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
__de__ It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
__de__ It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
__de__ So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
__de__ Sort of an interesting thing .
__de__ It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
__de__ And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
__de__ You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
__de__ In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
__de__ And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
__de__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
__de__ I actually went to see this one .
__de__ There was a lot of people there .
__de__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
__de__ I was born and raised in North Korea .
__de__ Although my family constantly struggled against poverty , I was always loved and cared for first , because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
__de__ But then the great famine began in 1994 .
__de__ I was four years old .
__de__ My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
__de__ I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
__de__ Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
__de__ For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
__de__ On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
__de__ But even as a child , I could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
__de__ Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
__de__ I saw my father wither away and die .
__de__ In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
__de__ Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
__de__ It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
__de__ But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
__de__ I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
__de__ Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
__de__ My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
__de__ My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
__de__ But that is no way to survive .
__de__ I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
__de__ So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
__de__ Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
__de__ Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
__de__ I was not uncommon .
__de__ Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
__de__ When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
__de__ That hope kept me alive .
__de__ I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
__de__ I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
__de__ But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
__de__ Hope kept me alive .
__de__ Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
__de__ After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
__de__ I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
__de__ I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
__de__ I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
__de__ I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
__de__ North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
__de__ Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
__de__ I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
__de__ I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
__de__ I was 16 years old .
__de__ I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
__de__ I thought more people would help me .
__de__ But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
__de__ I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
__de__ By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
__de__ Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
__de__ I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
__de__ Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
__de__ And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
__de__ Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
__de__ My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
__de__ At one point , my father gave up on me .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
__de__ But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
__de__ So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
__de__ I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
__de__ I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
__de__ But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
__de__ And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
__de__ When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
__de__ I was so happy .
__de__ I looked at him sitting next to me .
__de__ He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
__de__ Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
__de__ My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
__de__ I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
__de__ My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
__de__ And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
__de__ I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
__de__ ( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
__de__ You have to choose to believe in hope .
__de__ You have to make it yourself .
__de__ In North Korea , I made it myself .
__de__ Hope brought me to America .
__de__ But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
__de__ My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
__de__ I did not come here by myself .
__de__ I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
__de__ Many people helped me along the way to get here .
__de__ North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
__de__ They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
__de__ This is my message to you .
__de__ Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
__de__ Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
__de__ My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
__de__ In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
__de__ A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
__de__ But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
__de__ I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
__de__ Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
__de__ AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
__de__ ( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
__de__ Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
__de__ I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
__de__ And I — oh , gosh .
__de__ I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
__de__ I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
__de__ And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
__de__ AH : Sure , please .
__de__ JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
__de__ I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
__de__ How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
__de__ Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
__de__ That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
__de__ And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
__de__ The reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
__de__ So for example , in the case of Ticketmaster , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
__de__ CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
__de__ And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
__de__ So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
__de__ The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
__de__ But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
__de__ Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
__de__ This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
__de__ ( Laughter ) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
__de__ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
__de__ This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
__de__ And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
__de__ So let me tell you what this project started .
__de__ So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
__de__ When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
__de__ I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
__de__ But then I started feeling bad .
__de__ See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
__de__ And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs .
__de__ So then I started feeling bad .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
__de__ But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
__de__ So see , here &apos;s the thing .
__de__ While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
__de__ Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
__de__ So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
__de__ Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
__de__ And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
__de__ So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
__de__ So let me explain how this works .
__de__ So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
__de__ Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
__de__ Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
__de__ Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
__de__ You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
__de__ Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
__de__ It gives you an image for every page of the book .
__de__ This is an image with text for every page of the book .
__de__ The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
__de__ That &apos;s using a technology called OCR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
__de__ Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
__de__ Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
__de__ For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
__de__ So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
__de__ So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
__de__ And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
__de__ But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
__de__ So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
__de__ We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
__de__ And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
__de__ And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
__de__ So this is how the system works .
__de__ And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
__de__ So for example , Ticketmaster .
__de__ So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
__de__ Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
__de__ Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
__de__ And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
__de__ It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
__de__ And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet .
__de__ ( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
__de__ And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
__de__ So funny things can happen .
__de__ For example , we presented this word .
__de__ It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christians &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
__de__ But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
__de__ So we get this . ( Text : bad christians ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Oops . ( Laughter )
__de__ Here &apos;s another really bad one .
__de__ JohnEdwards.com ( Text : Damn liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
__de__ Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
__de__ See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
__de__ So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
__de__ I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
__de__ Here &apos;s how it works .
__de__ Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
__de__ Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
__de__ But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
__de__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
__de__ There are tens of thousands of these .
__de__ Some of them are very cute . ( Text : clenched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funnier .
__de__ ( Text : stoned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg . ( Laughter )
__de__ Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
__de__ So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
__de__ This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA : 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
__de__ And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
__de__ So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
__de__ It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
__de__ And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
__de__ But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
__de__ So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
__de__ So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
__de__ Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
__de__ This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
__de__ It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
__de__ Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
__de__ ( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
__de__ So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
__de__ It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Severin Hacker .
__de__ Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
__de__ So I posed the question to my graduate student .
__de__ By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
__de__ So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
__de__ Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
__de__ First of all , translating the Web .
__de__ So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
__de__ A large fraction of it is in English .
__de__ If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
__de__ But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
__de__ So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
__de__ So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
__de__ Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
__de__ Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
__de__ Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
__de__ Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
__de__ Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
__de__ It makes a lot of mistakes .
__de__ Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
__de__ So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
__de__ Actually it was a forum post .
__de__ It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
__de__ It was translated from Japanese into English .
__de__ So I &apos;ll just let you read .
__de__ This person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
__de__ So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
__de__ So he &apos;s just explaining something .
__de__ Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
__de__ ( Text : At often , the goat-time install a error is vomit . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
__de__ ( Text : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the dragon ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
__de__ ( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
__de__ ( Text : Please apologize for your stupidity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
__de__ So back to the question .
__de__ So we need people to translate the whole Web .
__de__ So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
__de__ We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
__de__ We could do that .
__de__ Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
__de__ For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
__de__ Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
__de__ It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
__de__ If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
__de__ So it would be very expensive .
__de__ So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
__de__ Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
__de__ The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
__de__ So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
__de__ That &apos;s a big problem .
__de__ The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
__de__ How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
__de__ Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
__de__ So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
__de__ Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
__de__ But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
__de__ There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
__de__ And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals , and that is language education .
__de__ So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
__de__ People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
__de__ And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
__de__ For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
__de__ So people really , really want to learn a new language .
__de__ So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Duolingo — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
__de__ And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
__de__ So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
__de__ There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
__de__ We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
__de__ And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
__de__ And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
__de__ But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
__de__ Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
__de__ First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
__de__ We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
__de__ People really can learn a language with it .
__de__ And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
__de__ So people really do learn a language .
__de__ And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
__de__ Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
__de__ As opposed to learning with made-up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
__de__ So people really do learn a language .
__de__ But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
__de__ So let me show you one example .
__de__ This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
__de__ The top is the German .
__de__ The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
__de__ And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
__de__ You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
__de__ Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
__de__ We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
__de__ Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
__de__ So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
__de__ Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
__de__ So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
__de__ And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
__de__ Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
__de__ Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
__de__ So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
__de__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
__de__ The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
__de__ So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
__de__ This is totally biased towards the rich .
__de__ Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
__de__ So this is how we could monetize this .
__de__ Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
__de__ But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
__de__ So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
__de__ So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
__de__ We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
__de__ We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
__de__ By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
__de__ So thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
__de__ And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
__de__ And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians .
__de__ She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
__de__ And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
__de__ But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
__de__ The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
__de__ Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
__de__ So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
__de__ Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
__de__ In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
__de__ And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
__de__ Now , she had no idea what to look for .
__de__ This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
__de__ Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
__de__ Had they consumed colored drinks ?
__de__ Did they eat fish and chips ?
__de__ Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
__de__ What time of life had they started school ?
__de__ And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
__de__ By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant .
__de__ Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
__de__ Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
__de__ It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
__de__ And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
__de__ Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 .
__de__ People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
__de__ In fact , she need not have hurried .
__de__ It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women .
__de__ The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
__de__ A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
__de__ Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
__de__ So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
__de__ So , how did she know that she was right ?
__de__ Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
__de__ She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
__de__ So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
__de__ Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
__de__ George frankly preferred numbers to people .
__de__ But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought disconfirmation .
__de__ Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
__de__ He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
__de__ Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
__de__ It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
__de__ I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
__de__ Alice and George were very good at conflict .
__de__ They saw it as thinking .
__de__ So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
__de__ Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
__de__ That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
__de__ That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
__de__ And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
__de__ Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
__de__ And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
__de__ Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
__de__ &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
__de__ But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
__de__ So how do organizations think ?
__de__ Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
__de__ And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
__de__ And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
__de__ In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
__de__ Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
__de__ Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
__de__ It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
__de__ They can &apos;t think together .
__de__ And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
__de__ So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
__de__ Because it does take skill and practice , too .
__de__ If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
__de__ So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
__de__ And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
__de__ He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
__de__ He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
__de__ But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
__de__ So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
__de__ After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
__de__ Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
__de__ But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
__de__ In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
__de__ And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
__de__ It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
__de__ So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
__de__ And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
__de__ Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
__de__ But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
__de__ And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
__de__ And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
__de__ They think of him as a leader .
__de__ So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
__de__ Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
__de__ I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
__de__ I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
__de__ The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
__de__ It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
__de__ But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
__de__ Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
__de__ But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
__de__ Openness isn &apos;t the end .
__de__ It &apos;s the beginning .

__de__ Thank you .
__de__ Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania .
__de__ I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
__de__ It was a simple machine that changed my life .
__de__ Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
__de__ I had never used a computer .
__de__ I had never seen an Internet .
__de__ On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
__de__ My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )
__de__ There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
__de__ But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
__de__ I would like to share that story today .
__de__ We have seven children in my family .
__de__ All sisters , excepting me .
__de__ This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
__de__ Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
__de__ Like everyone else , we grew maize .
__de__ One year our fortune turned very bad .
__de__ In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
__de__ Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
__de__ My family ate one meal per day , at night .
__de__ Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
__de__ The food passes through our bodies .
__de__ We drop down to nothing .
__de__ In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
__de__ Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
__de__ I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
__de__ It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
__de__ I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
__de__ So I went to a library .
__de__ I read books , science books , especially physics .
__de__ I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
__de__ I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
__de__ Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
__de__ It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
__de__ Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
__de__ So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
__de__ But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
__de__ Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
__de__ Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
__de__ It was one light at first .
__de__ And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
__de__ Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
__de__ Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
__de__ ( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
__de__ I had never seen an airplane before .
__de__ I had never slept in a hotel .
__de__ So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
__de__ So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
__de__ God bless .
__de__ Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
__de__ I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
__de__ Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
__de__ Thank you .

__de__ In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
__de__ You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
__de__ And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
__de__ If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
__de__ And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
__de__ We would never do that in our own countries .
__de__ But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
__de__ This is happening to us today .
__de__ And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
__de__ And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
__de__ And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
__de__ If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
__de__ We have three main groups .
__de__ We have online criminals .
__de__ Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
__de__ And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
__de__ These guys make money .
__de__ They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
__de__ We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
__de__ Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
__de__ This is Alfred Gonzalez .
__de__ This is Stephen Watt .
__de__ This is Bjorn Sundin .
__de__ This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
__de__ These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
__de__ The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
__de__ Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
__de__ And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
__de__ And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
__de__ In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
__de__ The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
__de__ They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
__de__ Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
__de__ So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
__de__ And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
__de__ This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
__de__ DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
__de__ It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
__de__ Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
__de__ And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
__de__ And his answer was yes .
__de__ So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
__de__ Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
__de__ They sell certificates .
__de__ What do you do with certificates ?
__de__ Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
__de__ Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
__de__ Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
__de__ and issue rogue certificates .
__de__ And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
__de__ What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
__de__ Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
__de__ Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
__de__ They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
__de__ The company headquarters are right here .
__de__ So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
__de__ But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
__de__ For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
__de__ If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
__de__ But today , it goes beyond that .
__de__ They will tap your Internet connection .
__de__ They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
__de__ Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
__de__ Why should I worry ?
__de__ Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
__de__ Privacy is implied .
__de__ Privacy is not up for discussion .
__de__ This is not a question between privacy against security .
__de__ It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
__de__ And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
__de__ And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
__de__ And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
__de__ We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
__de__ It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
__de__ This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
__de__ Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__de__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__de__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__de__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__de__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__de__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__de__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__de__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__de__ But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
__de__ Values are a certain kind of fact .
__de__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__de__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__de__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__de__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__de__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__de__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__de__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__de__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__de__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__de__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
__de__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__de__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__de__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__de__ Probably not .
__de__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__de__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__de__ And morality relates to these truths .
__de__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__de__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__de__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__de__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__de__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__de__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__de__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__de__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__de__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__de__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__de__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__de__ And these await our discovery .
__de__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__de__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__de__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__de__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__de__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__de__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
__de__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__de__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__de__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__de__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__de__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__de__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__de__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
__de__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__de__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__de__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__de__ As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
__de__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__de__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__de__ There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__de__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
__de__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__de__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__de__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__de__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__de__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__de__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__de__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__de__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
__de__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__de__ Why would we think this ?
__de__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__de__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__de__ But it clearly admits some exceptions .
__de__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__de__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__de__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__de__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__de__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__de__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__de__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__de__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__de__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
__de__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__de__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
__de__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__de__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__de__ Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__de__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__de__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__de__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__de__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__de__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__de__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__de__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__de__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
__de__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__de__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__de__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__de__ But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__de__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__de__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__de__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__de__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__de__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
__de__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
__de__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__de__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__de__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__de__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__de__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__de__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__de__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__de__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__de__ But this is just the point .
__de__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__de__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__de__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__de__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__de__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__de__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__de__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__de__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__de__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__de__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__de__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__de__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__de__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__de__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__de__ It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__de__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__de__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
__de__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__de__ Language seems to be really important here .
__de__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__de__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__de__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__de__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
__de__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__de__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__de__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
__de__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__de__ But can you reconcile that ?
__de__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__de__ Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__de__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__de__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__de__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__de__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__de__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__de__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__de__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__de__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__de__ SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
__de__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__de__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__de__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__de__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__de__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__de__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
__de__ A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
__de__ This one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her Broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
__de__ And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
__de__ And after a few moments , her therapist tries a new tack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she sings , in one descending scale , she sings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
__de__ And it &apos;s a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
__de__ Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug , one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
__de__ Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .
__de__ And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
__de__ When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
__de__ and how late-stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
__de__ But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
__de__ I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
__de__ I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes , these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with disfiguring cancers .
__de__ I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor , that doctor without borders .
__de__ On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
__de__ Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
__de__ It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
__de__ And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
__de__ And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic .
__de__ It was my first audition , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
__de__ And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra , to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
__de__ But a year later , I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician .
__de__ Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard , but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s , was treated with thorazine at Bellevue , and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later .
__de__ Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The Soloist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
__de__ And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
__de__ Playing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
__de__ I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
__de__ And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill .
__de__ But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
__de__ There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
__de__ And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel , I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony , bringing the light of music into the very darkest places , performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row , performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane .
__de__ After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
__de__ Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the footlights , out of the tuxedo tails , the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
__de__ Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
__de__ Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
__de__ The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brahms , or chamber music by Beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
__de__ And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
__de__ And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
__de__ I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Keats , the Romantic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
__de__ Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
__de__ And Keats said , &quot; &quot; Beauty is truth , and truth beauty .
__de__ That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
__de__ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
__de__ I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
__de__ I have not slept in weeks .
__de__ Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
__de__ Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
__de__ So I would walk around in a daze during the day .
__de__ I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
__de__ In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
__de__ Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
__de__ My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
__de__ And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
__de__ But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
__de__ And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
__de__ Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
__de__ And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
__de__ This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
__de__ How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
__de__ And so we started talking about this .
__de__ And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
__de__ All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
__de__ But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
__de__ And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
__de__ So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
__de__ And the idea was to put McSweeney &apos;s — McSweeney &apos;s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
__de__ It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
__de__ We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
__de__ So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
__de__ You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
__de__ So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this mural , that &apos;s a Chris Ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
__de__ So we rented this space .
__de__ And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
__de__ You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
__de__ You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
__de__ It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
__de__ We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look — while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
__de__ And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
__de__ Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
__de__ You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
__de__ A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate supply-like .
__de__ Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
__de__ We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
__de__ Up at the top , you see the eyepatch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch , and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mitzvahs and whatever .
__de__ So we opened this place . And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
__de__ This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
__de__ These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Practical Joking with Pirates . &quot;
__de__ While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
__de__ That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
__de__ It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
__de__ So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
__de__ The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
__de__ We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
__de__ We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
__de__ I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle .
__de__ Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
__de__ It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
__de__ And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
__de__ And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
__de__ And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
__de__ And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
__de__ And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari , a longtime San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
__de__ She took over as executive director .
__de__ Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
__de__ And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
__de__ The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
__de__ You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
__de__ And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
__de__ They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored .
__de__ So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
__de__ And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
__de__ If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
__de__ But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
__de__ And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
__de__ Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
__de__ First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
__de__ And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
__de__ And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
__de__ And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
__de__ They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
__de__ So there &apos;s no stigma .
__de__ They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
__de__ They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
__de__ These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
__de__ They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
__de__ There &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at McSweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
__de__ But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
__de__ They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
__de__ They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
__de__ And that makes a happy family .
__de__ A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
__de__ A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
__de__ So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
__de__ So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
__de__ And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster .
__de__ And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
__de__ The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
__de__ So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
__de__ Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
__de__ So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
__de__ This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
__de__ You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
__de__ So this is one of the books that they do .
__de__ Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic . &quot;
__de__ And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
__de__ So then we still had more tutors to use .
__de__ This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
__de__ The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
__de__ We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
__de__ The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
__de__ The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
__de__ Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
__de__ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
__de__ We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
__de__ Whoever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
__de__ The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
__de__ They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
__de__ And that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
__de__ So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
__de__ Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Everett Middle School Writers &apos; Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
__de__ It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
__de__ This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight-Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages — English and Spanish .
__de__ So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
__de__ I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
__de__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
__de__ She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
__de__ She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
__de__ It &apos;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
__de__ I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
__de__ We had a big party at the end .
__de__ This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
__de__ You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
__de__ And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
__de__ Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
__de__ The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
__de__ And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
__de__ It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
__de__ And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
__de__ We sell all the student books .
__de__ Where else would you put them , right ?
__de__ So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money .
__de__ So it was paying the rent .
__de__ And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
__de__ But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
__de__ It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
__de__ There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
__de__ And it became a gateway to the community .
__de__ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
__de__ What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
__de__ They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
__de__ And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
__de__ This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
__de__ So the store actually did really well .
__de__ But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
__de__ It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
__de__ So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
__de__ So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
__de__ And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
__de__ They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
__de__ They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
__de__ So , knowing the crime-fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company .
__de__ This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
__de__ And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
__de__ So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Costco for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
__de__ These are all handmade .
__de__ These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
__de__ All the packaging is done by Sam Potts .
__de__ So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
__de__ This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
__de__ Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
__de__ Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
__de__ These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
__de__ This is a secret identity kit .
__de__ If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Hoboken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
__de__ So , this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
__de__ There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that .
__de__ So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
__de__ You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
__de__ It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
__de__ But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
__de__ All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
__de__ I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
__de__ It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
__de__ And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
__de__ So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
__de__ It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
__de__ This is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
__de__ You can read this quote .
__de__ Addicted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
__de__ Came in . Got this concentrated attention .
__de__ And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
__de__ So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
__de__ It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
__de__ So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
__de__ He &apos;s now been published in five books .
__de__ He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super-Has-Beens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Penguin Balboa , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
__de__ And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
__de__ He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
__de__ There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
__de__ So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
__de__ This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers .
__de__ So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-Eleven would be .
__de__ Leeches . Mammoth chunks . They even have their own Slurpee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Order . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
__de__ These are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pittsfield , Massachusetts ; Ink Spot in Cincinnati ; Youth Speaks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin Bat Cave in Austin ; Fighting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Roddy Doyle , this will be open in April .
__de__ Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
__de__ All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
__de__ Profound leaps forward !
__de__ And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
__de__ I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
__de__ I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
__de__ We created a website .
__de__ I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
__de__ We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
__de__ Always let the teachers lead the way .
__de__ They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
__de__ There are a million ways .
__de__ You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
__de__ So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
__de__ This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
__de__ This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
__de__ Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
__de__ If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
__de__ You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
__de__ And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
__de__ And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureaucratically untenable .
__de__ You can do and use the skills that you have .
__de__ The schools need you . The teachers need you .
__de__ Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
__de__ Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
__de__ You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
__de__ Thank you so much .
__de__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
__de__ And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
__de__ And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day .
__de__ And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hallelujah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
__de__ My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
__de__ But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
__de__ I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
__de__ And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laughed .
__de__ And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
__de__ And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
__de__ Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
__de__ My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
__de__ It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
__de__ That ’ s a big thing in California .
__de__ And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
__de__ And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
__de__ And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
__de__ You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
__de__ Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
__de__ And so I argued with people about that , I argued and I argued .
__de__ I called my parents up .
__de__ I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
__de__ They ’ re back in Philadelphia .
__de__ And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mothers are like that .
__de__ And so , on my 27th birthday I decided , because I argued so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
__de__ And so I did .
__de__ I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
__de__ And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
__de__ And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
__de__ Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
__de__ And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
__de__ And then I would launch in .
__de__ Well , that just ended communication .
__de__ So on this first day I actually listened .
__de__ And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
__de__ I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
__de__ I didn ’ t .
__de__ And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
__de__ So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
__de__ Well , that lasted 17 years .
__de__ Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
__de__ And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
__de__ I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
__de__ It ’ s only 500 miles .
__de__ And I went into the Registrar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
__de__ I had a newspaper clipping .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
__de__ You don ’ t … ?
__de__ We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
__de__ And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
__de__ And my father came out , he was so proud .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor ’ s degree ?
__de__ You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
__de__ I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana .
__de__ I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
__de__ I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
__de__ There are two stories in Montana .
__de__ The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
__de__ And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Register for one credit .
__de__ You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , South America .
__de__ So I did that .
__de__ He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate — you ’ re matriculating , so you can use the library .
__de__ And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
__de__ They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
__de__ But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
__de__ They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
__de__ And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
__de__ I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
__de__ I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
__de__ All the students sat around and they went ...
__de__ ( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
__de__ They had to take that class with me .
__de__ Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
__de__ And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
__de__ and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
__de__ &quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a handsaw . &quot;
__de__ &quot; Well , you can ’ t clearcut with a ... &quot;
__de__ &quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
__de__ &quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about selective forestry . &quot;
__de__ Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
__de__ I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
__de__ But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
__de__ And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
__de__ And so I went on .
__de__ My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
__de__ What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hunched my shoulder , I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin .
__de__ I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
__de__ No one was interested in oil spills .
__de__ But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
__de__ And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
__de__ My dad came out again .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
__de__ My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
__de__ I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
__de__ And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
__de__ And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
__de__ And I ’ m thanking you , and I &apos;m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
__de__ And that ’ s communication .
__de__ And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
__de__ And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
__de__ Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
__de__ Well , my journey kept going on .
__de__ My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
__de__ I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
__de__ I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
__de__ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
__de__ &quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
__de__ How could that be , how could that be ?
__de__ How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
__de__ Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
__de__ And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
__de__ And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
__de__ I started talking because I had studied environment .
__de__ I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
__de__ And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
__de__ And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
__de__ Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
__de__ And so that ’ s the message that I had .
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
__de__ This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motorized vehicles .
__de__ I was walking through El Dorado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in Venezuela , and I don ’ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
__de__ There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; Pasaporte , pasaporte , &quot; &quot; and with an M16 pointed at me .
__de__ And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
__de__ I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
__de__ I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
__de__ What possessed me to say this thing ?
__de__ The road turned into the jungle .
__de__ I didn ’ t get shot .
__de__ And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Almighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
__de__ It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
__de__ I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
__de__ The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
__de__ Now how could that be ?
__de__ Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
__de__ But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
__de__ I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador .
__de__ I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
__de__ And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
__de__ You know , we can do it .
__de__ I was going to have to change .
__de__ And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
__de__ I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
__de__ I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
__de__ But I know I needed to .
__de__ I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
__de__ And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
__de__ And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
__de__ And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
__de__ We have to change now .
__de__ As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists .
__de__ So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
__de__ And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
__de__ So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
__de__ Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
__de__ So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the latest episode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — longest running soap opera , which is cricket .
__de__ And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
__de__ It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue .
__de__ And like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
__de__ And that &apos;s exactly what cricket has done .
__de__ It &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20-over game .
__de__ And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
__de__ But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
__de__ Cricket wasn &apos;t always this speed-driven generations game .
__de__ There was a time when you played cricket , you played timeless test matches , when you played on till the game got over .
__de__ And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March .
__de__ And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town , which is a two-hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
__de__ So , the match was ended in between .
__de__ And one of the English batsmen said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__de__ Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
__de__ There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days , so you don &apos;t play on Sundays . And one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
__de__ But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket : because we had about the same pace of life .
__de__ ( Laughter ) The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
__de__ You fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
__de__ And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
__de__ The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
__de__ Princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers .
__de__ But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
__de__ Take a look : You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
__de__ ( Laughter ) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges — that &apos;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time .
__de__ Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
__de__ ( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
__de__ But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
__de__ You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket .
__de__ And then an enormous accident took place .
__de__ In Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
__de__ And we won this World Cup in 1983 .
__de__ And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game , and we played it virtually every day .
__de__ There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere .
__de__ But there was another big date .
__de__ 1983 was when we won the World Cup .
__de__ 1991 , &apos; 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
__de__ And so we allowed multinationals into India .
__de__ We cut customs duties , we reduced import duties , and we got all the multinationals coming in , with multinational budgets , who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
__de__ And there are only two vehicles in India — one real , one scripted .
__de__ The scripted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cricket .
__de__ And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
__de__ And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
__de__ And so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in .
__de__ Television started covering cricket . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
__de__ The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
__de__ And then another big accident happened in our cricket .
__de__ England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
__de__ Thank God for them .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see .
__de__ India didn &apos;t want to play the T20 World Cup .
__de__ But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin .
__de__ And then something very dramatic happened .
__de__ We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
__de__ ( Crowd cheering ) The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder .
__de__ Announcer : And Zishan takes it ! India wins !
__de__ What a match for a Twenty20 final .
__de__ India , the world champions .
__de__ ( Cheering ) India , T20 champions .
__de__ But what a game we had , M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air , but Misbah-ul-Haq , what a player .
__de__ A massive , massive success : India , the world TT champions .
__de__ Harsha Bhogle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket .
__de__ The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast .
__de__ ( Laughter ) If he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
__de__ And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
__de__ It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
__de__ And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
__de__ And thankfully for all of us , the English are very good at inventing things , and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And so England invented T20 cricket , and allowed India to hijack it .
__de__ It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T20 league .
__de__ Six weeks , city versus city .
__de__ It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
__de__ One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
__de__ The other was Indian cricket .
__de__ Now , suddenly we had to support city leagues .
__de__ But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West .
__de__ America is a home of leagues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some glitzy leagues here in India . &quot;
__de__ But was India ready for it ?
__de__ Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized .
__de__ It was never promoted , it was never sold — it was organized .
__de__ And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
__de__ All of a sudden , you had that happening .
__de__ ( Music ) An opening ceremony to match every other .
__de__ This was an India that was buying Corvettes . This was an India that was buying Jaguar .
__de__ This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand &apos;s population twice over .
__de__ So , it was a different India .
__de__ But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
__de__ And so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .
__de__ Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
__de__ ( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes .
__de__ They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
__de__ And so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time .
__de__ And they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
__de__ I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues .
__de__ But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized .
__de__ So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Manchester United style promotion , but very Mumbai style promotion . Take a look .
__de__ ( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .
__de__ All along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .
__de__ Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot — if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn &apos;t go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad .
__de__ This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
__de__ And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
__de__ So , the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago , overnight . And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X. &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Fine , you play to date X , minus one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game ,
__de__ went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet — first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Never would India have thought on this scale before .
__de__ Never would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
__de__ We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
__de__ There is cricket and the movies .
__de__ And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs .
__de__ And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta .
__de__ They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .
__de__ And something very interesting happened .
__de__ We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket .
__de__ And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more .
__de__ And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that follows — if you did well , you got a hug from Preity Zinta .
__de__ So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching Preity Zinta .
__de__ ( Music ) And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd .
__de__ We &apos;d all seen matches in Kolkata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Shah Rukh , with the Bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata — not for India , but for Kolkata .
__de__ But take a look at this .
__de__ ( Music ) An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they &apos;d won in Kolkata .
__de__ Can you imagine ?
__de__ And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said ?
__de__ ( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta &apos;s team . &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pakistan in here .
__de__ I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
__de__ We can play cricket together , we can be friends .
__de__ So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
__de__ ( Applause ) There was criticism too because they said , &quot; &quot; Players are being bought and sold ?
__de__ Are they grain ?
__de__ Are they cattle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auction , you see .
__de__ How do you fix a price for a player ?
__de__ And so the auction that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so-and-so player . &quot;
__de__ There it is .
__de__ ( Music ) Auctioneer : Going at 1,500,000 dollars . Chennai .
__de__ Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars .
__de__ HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day — so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
__de__ The best Indian players who played every test match — every one of the internationals , the top of the line players — standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year .
__de__ Now they were getting 500,000 for six days &apos; work .
__de__ Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , and I &apos;m earning more than the footballers , wow . &quot; &quot; And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India .
__de__ Could you have imagined that day would come ?
__de__ One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
__de__ That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
__de__ So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
__de__ What India was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
__de__ Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today .
__de__ IPL became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .
__de__ Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks .
__de__ But we did it . You know why ?
__de__ Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
__de__ ( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching — the huge consuming class — everybody came to watch the cricket .
__de__ We &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in India , which is a pity , but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
__de__ Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
__de__ For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beggars , snake charmers , filth , Delhi belly — people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .
__de__ And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
__de__ Cricketers all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
__de__ And that felt good , you know ?
__de__ We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Delhi belly in there anymore .
__de__ There &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules .
__de__ Right so , finally , an English game that India usurped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
__de__ If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
__de__ You can &apos;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
__de__ So that &apos;s what T20 is doing .
__de__ Hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
__de__ Thank you very much . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
__de__ And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street .
__de__ This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
__de__ Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
__de__ So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
__de__ They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
__de__ Blocks have names .
__de__ Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
__de__ All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
__de__ And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
__de__ There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
__de__ The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
__de__ The second house ever built is house number two .
__de__ Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
__de__ So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
__de__ So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
__de__ ( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
__de__ But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
__de__ So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
__de__ And this map is also accurate .
__de__ ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
__de__ So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
__de__ Domo arigato gozaimashita .
__de__ Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
__de__ And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
__de__ That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
__de__ As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
__de__ After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
__de__ In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
__de__ And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
__de__ And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
__de__ Take nothing : do no harm .
__de__ I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
__de__ Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
__de__ And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
__de__ And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
__de__ They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
__de__ From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
__de__ Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
__de__ And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
__de__ But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
__de__ According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
__de__ That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
__de__ And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
__de__ So the equation is conceptual .
__de__ Still it works to help us understand the problem .
__de__ So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
__de__ Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
__de__ I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
__de__ Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
__de__ So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T2 — where it reduces impact ?
__de__ I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
__de__ Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
__de__ Linear : take , make , waste .
__de__ Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
__de__ Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
__de__ More carpet per man-hour .
__de__ Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
__de__ In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
__de__ And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
__de__ And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
__de__ We have measured our progress very rigorously .
__de__ So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
__de__ Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
__de__ ( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
__de__ So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
__de__ This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
__de__ Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
__de__ The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
__de__ Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
__de__ Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
__de__ Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
__de__ Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
__de__ We have diverted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
__de__ Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
__de__ We call it Cool Carpet .
__de__ And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
__de__ Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
__de__ You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
__de__ It is practical , and pretty too .
__de__ We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
__de__ We call this Mission Zero .
__de__ And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
__de__ A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
__de__ Here is the business case for sustainability .
__de__ From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
__de__ This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
__de__ And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
__de__ Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
__de__ Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
__de__ You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
__de__ And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
__de__ No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
__de__ Costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
__de__ It is a better business model .
__de__ And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
__de__ There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
__de__ But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
__de__ We literally gained market share .
__de__ We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
__de__ If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
__de__ I don &apos;t think so .
__de__ I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
__de__ That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
__de__ But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
__de__ And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
__de__ You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
__de__ But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
__de__ Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
__de__ At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
__de__ We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
__de__ And now the challenge is in execution .
__de__ And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
__de__ If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
__de__ And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
__de__ Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
__de__ Who is that person ?
__de__ Not you . Not I.
__de__ But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
__de__ And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
__de__ On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
__de__ But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
__de__ He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
__de__ And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
__de__ Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
__de__ Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
__de__ Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
__de__ A wise friend introduced us two .
__de__ And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
__de__ Knowing you has changed my thinking .
__de__ For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
__de__ Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
__de__ Begin , I will .
__de__ The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
__de__ We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
__de__ The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
__de__ And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
__de__ For you , it &apos;s your call .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__nl__ When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
__nl__ My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
__nl__ There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
__nl__ A morning that I will never forget .
__nl__ A real school .
__nl__ You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
__nl__ So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
__nl__ It was the only way we both could be educated .
__nl__ Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
__nl__ We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
__nl__ The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
__nl__ It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
__nl__ We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
__nl__ From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
__nl__ We always wondered what they knew about us .
__nl__ Were we being followed ?
__nl__ Do they know where we live ?
__nl__ We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
__nl__ I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
__nl__ My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
__nl__ A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
__nl__ But my educated mother became a teacher .
__nl__ There she is .
__nl__ She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
__nl__ And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
__nl__ There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
__nl__ To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
__nl__ During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
__nl__ I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
__nl__ Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
__nl__ But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
__nl__ So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
__nl__ I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
__nl__ Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
__nl__ Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
__nl__ ( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
__nl__ He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
__nl__ ( Applause ) My family believes in me .
__nl__ I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
__nl__ That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
__nl__ That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
__nl__ The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
__nl__ And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
__nl__ Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
__nl__ Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
__nl__ As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
__nl__ It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
__nl__ In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
__nl__ Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
__nl__ But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
__nl__ I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
__nl__ I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
__nl__ But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
__nl__ To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
__nl__ Like me , they are dreaming big .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ And you &apos;ll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
__nl__ And slightly more complex things appear .
__nl__ That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
__nl__ And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
__nl__ But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
__nl__ Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
__nl__ Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
__nl__ We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
__nl__ What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
__nl__ How old are you ? What do you do ?
__nl__ Then we get more personal with it .
__nl__ Have you ever had any diseases ?
__nl__ Have you ever been divorced ?
__nl__ Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
__nl__ What are you into ? Who are you into ?
__nl__ What gender do you like to sleep with ?
__nl__ I get it .
__nl__ We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
__nl__ We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
__nl__ We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
__nl__ We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
__nl__ Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
__nl__ Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
__nl__ The boxes are too narrow .
__nl__ And this can get really dangerous .
__nl__ So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
__nl__ I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
__nl__ I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
__nl__ I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
__nl__ Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
__nl__ So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
__nl__ I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
__nl__ They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
__nl__ So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
__nl__ When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
__nl__ I kept up the charade for eight years .
__nl__ So this is me when I was 11 .
__nl__ I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
__nl__ See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
__nl__ In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
__nl__ Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
__nl__ When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
__nl__ At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
__nl__ It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
__nl__ I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
__nl__ I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
__nl__ If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
__nl__ But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
__nl__ Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
__nl__ When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
__nl__ No one is exactly shocked .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
__nl__ When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
__nl__ Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
__nl__ See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
__nl__ I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
__nl__ So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
__nl__ And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
__nl__ But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
__nl__ And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
__nl__ And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
__nl__ If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
__nl__ At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
__nl__ I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines — girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
__nl__ I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
__nl__ And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
__nl__ I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
__nl__ I was not an activist .
__nl__ I wave no flags in my own life .
__nl__ But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
__nl__ How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
__nl__ Were we even a group ? What group ?
__nl__ And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
__nl__ Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
__nl__ And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
__nl__ It might give them pause .
__nl__ Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
__nl__ Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
__nl__ For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
__nl__ Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
__nl__ So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
__nl__ And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
__nl__ So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
__nl__ And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
__nl__ And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
__nl__ And then we made this .
__nl__ ( Music ) Video : I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
__nl__ Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
__nl__ My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
__nl__ My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
__nl__ ( Music ) &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
__nl__ It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
__nl__ We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
__nl__ There is no equality in the United States .
__nl__ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Marriage &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Freedom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
__nl__ The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
__nl__ Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
__nl__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
__nl__ So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
__nl__ And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
__nl__ I want to take the project across the country .
__nl__ I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
__nl__ This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
__nl__ I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
__nl__ ( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Self evident truths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) iO Tillett Wright : Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
__nl__ Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
__nl__ And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
__nl__ So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
__nl__ That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
__nl__ I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
__nl__ Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
__nl__ So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
__nl__ Visibility really is key .
__nl__ Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
__nl__ Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
__nl__ Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
__nl__ Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
__nl__ But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
__nl__ In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
__nl__ It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
__nl__ It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
__nl__ At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; gays &quot; &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
__nl__ Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
__nl__ At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
__nl__ And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
__nl__ Can you quantify your openness ?
__nl__ Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
__nl__ Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
__nl__ I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; &quot; Grey . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
__nl__ And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
__nl__ I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
__nl__ The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
__nl__ And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
__nl__ Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
__nl__ Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
__nl__ Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
__nl__ Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
__nl__ Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
__nl__ After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
__nl__ Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
__nl__ So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
__nl__ Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
__nl__ Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
__nl__ What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
__nl__ And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
__nl__ At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
__nl__ So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
__nl__ Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
__nl__ It &apos;s too late .
__nl__ Because I already am all of those things .
__nl__ We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
__nl__ So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
__nl__ Thank you .

__nl__ I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
__nl__ The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
__nl__ I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
__nl__ I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
__nl__ Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
__nl__ When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
__nl__ As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
__nl__ I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
__nl__ For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
__nl__ Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
__nl__ We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
__nl__ After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
__nl__ It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
__nl__ Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
__nl__ Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
__nl__ Some I even considered like my second home .
__nl__ But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
__nl__ A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
__nl__ That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
__nl__ A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
__nl__ That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
__nl__ Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
__nl__ Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
__nl__ Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
__nl__ Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
__nl__ Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
__nl__ In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
__nl__ This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
__nl__ Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
__nl__ Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
__nl__ There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
__nl__ So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
__nl__ Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
__nl__ Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
__nl__ I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
__nl__ I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
__nl__ I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
__nl__ I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
__nl__ I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
__nl__ As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
__nl__ In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
__nl__ The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
__nl__ It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
__nl__ How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
__nl__ Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
__nl__ They have nothing to compare it to .
__nl__ When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
__nl__ I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
__nl__ Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
__nl__ In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
__nl__ They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
__nl__ This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
__nl__ It was more like a restaurant .
__nl__ Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
__nl__ Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
__nl__ Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
__nl__ The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
__nl__ Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
__nl__ I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
__nl__ There were no back doors .
__nl__ There were no windows large enough to climb through .
__nl__ These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
__nl__ Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
__nl__ Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
__nl__ It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
__nl__ The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
__nl__ I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
__nl__ This is a family portrait .
__nl__ The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
__nl__ They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
__nl__ My interpreter told me their stories .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
__nl__ When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
__nl__ I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
__nl__ Wrong . They were all enslaved .
__nl__ Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
__nl__ This young child is eight years old .
__nl__ He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
__nl__ He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
__nl__ The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
__nl__ Many of them drown .
__nl__ For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
__nl__ Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
__nl__ I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
__nl__ in the cold , windy night .
__nl__ And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
__nl__ I want to introduce you to Kofi .
__nl__ Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
__nl__ I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
__nl__ Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
__nl__ Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
__nl__ Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
__nl__ Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
__nl__ He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
__nl__ At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
__nl__ Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
__nl__ After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
__nl__ Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
__nl__ Mercury is used in the extraction process .
__nl__ These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
__nl__ When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
__nl__ I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
__nl__ The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
__nl__ At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
__nl__ All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
__nl__ In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
__nl__ This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
__nl__ When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
__nl__ When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
__nl__ On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
__nl__ Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
__nl__ I want to shine a light on slavery .
__nl__ When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
__nl__ They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
__nl__ I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
__nl__ I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
__nl__ These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
__nl__ There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
__nl__ I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
__nl__ Thank you very much .

__nl__ The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
__nl__ But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
__nl__ Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
__nl__ So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
__nl__ These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
__nl__ In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban .
__nl__ And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
__nl__ And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
__nl__ Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
__nl__ At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
__nl__ So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
__nl__ We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
__nl__ This is our group , our main group of weavers .
__nl__ They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
__nl__ They all have bank accounts .
__nl__ They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
__nl__ It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
__nl__ This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
__nl__ And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
__nl__ And the rest says it all .
__nl__ Thank you very much .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
__nl__ If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
__nl__ Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
__nl__ Here &apos;s my clock .
__nl__ It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
__nl__ Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
__nl__ So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
__nl__ At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
__nl__ Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
__nl__ So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
__nl__ However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__nl__ It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
__nl__ In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
__nl__ In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
__nl__ This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
__nl__ So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
__nl__ Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
__nl__ You can see why I hate Chris .
__nl__ One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
__nl__ This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
__nl__ All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
__nl__ Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
__nl__ And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
__nl__ So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
__nl__ To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
__nl__ Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
__nl__ Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
__nl__ Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
__nl__ Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
__nl__ ( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
__nl__ So here are some other results .
__nl__ The first is for instant noodles .
__nl__ Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
__nl__ You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
__nl__ OK , next , clubbing .
__nl__ These people I still do hang out with .
__nl__ All right , and smoking .
__nl__ Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
__nl__ OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
__nl__ It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
__nl__ Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
__nl__ In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
__nl__ That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
__nl__ Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
__nl__ So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
__nl__ Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
__nl__ And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
__nl__ You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
__nl__ Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__nl__ It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
__nl__ In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
__nl__ And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
__nl__ You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
__nl__ Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
__nl__ So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
__nl__ Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
__nl__ We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
__nl__ So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
__nl__ Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
__nl__ It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
__nl__ Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
__nl__ Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
__nl__ Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
__nl__ There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
__nl__ Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
__nl__ Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
__nl__ Oh , one last thing before I leave .
__nl__ And the best way to do that is with free candy .
__nl__ You guys ready ?
__nl__ All right .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ When I was six years old , I received my gifts .
__nl__ My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea .
__nl__ So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom , and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner .
__nl__ If you hear your name called , go and pick up your gift and sit down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?
__nl__ What could go wrong ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Well , there were 40 of us to start with , and every time I heard someone &apos;s name called , I would give out the heartiest cheer .
__nl__ And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ...
__nl__ and three left .
__nl__ And I was one of them .
__nl__ And the compliments stopped .
__nl__ Well , at that moment , I was crying .
__nl__ And the teacher was freaking out .
__nl__ So behave next year — someone might say something nice about you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , as I &apos;m describing this you , you probably know I remember this really well . ( Laughter )
__nl__ But I don &apos;t know who felt worse that day .
__nl__ Was it me or the teacher ?
__nl__ She must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds .
__nl__ And without the humor .
__nl__ You know , when you see people get roasted on TV , it was funny .
__nl__ There was nothing funny about that day .
__nl__ So that was one version of me , and I would die to avoid being in that situation again — to get rejected in public again .
__nl__ That &apos;s one version .
__nl__ Then fast-forward eight years .
__nl__ Bill Gates came to my hometown — Beijing , China — to speak , and I saw his message .
__nl__ I fell in love with that guy .
__nl__ I thought , wow , I know what I want to do now .
__nl__ And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that letter .
__nl__ And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad handwriting , but I did highlight some key words .
__nl__ You get the idea .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) So ...
__nl__ that was another version of me : one who will conquer the world .
__nl__ Well , then two years later , I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States .
__nl__ I jumped on it , because that was where Bill Gates lived , right ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey .
__nl__ Then , fast-forward another 14 years .
__nl__ I was 30 .
__nl__ Nope , I didn &apos;t build that company .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t even start .
__nl__ I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company .
__nl__ And I felt I was stuck ; I was stagnant .
__nl__ Why is that ?
__nl__ Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter ?
__nl__ It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
__nl__ It &apos;s because every time I had a new idea , every time I wanted to try something new , even at work — I wanted to make a proposal , I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group — I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old .
__nl__ One wanted to conquer the world — make a difference — another was afraid of rejection .
__nl__ And every time that six-year-old won .
__nl__ When I was an entrepreneur , I was presented with an investment opportunity , and then I was turned down .
__nl__ And that rejection hurt me .
__nl__ It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there .
__nl__ But then I thought , hey , would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection ?
__nl__ Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that ?
__nl__ No way .
__nl__ And this is where it clicked for me .
__nl__ OK , I can build a better company .
__nl__ I can build a better team or better product , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better leader .
__nl__ I &apos;ve got to be a better person .
__nl__ I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore .
__nl__ I have to put him back in his place .
__nl__ So this is where I went online and looked for help .
__nl__ Google was my friend .
__nl__ Then I came up with a bunch of &quot; &quot; rah-rah &quot; &quot; inspirational articles about &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t take it personally , just overcome it . &quot; &quot; Who doesn &apos;t know that ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But why was I still so scared ?
__nl__ Then I found this website by luck .
__nl__ It &apos;s called rejectiontherapy.com.
__nl__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Rejection Therapy &quot; &quot; was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur .
__nl__ His name is Jason Comely .
__nl__ And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection , and every day get rejected at something , and then by the end , you desensitize yourself from the pain .
__nl__ And I loved that idea .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this .
__nl__ And I &apos;ll feel myself getting rejected 100 days . &quot; &quot; And I came up with my own rejection ideas , and I made a video blog out of it .
__nl__ And so here &apos;s what I did .
__nl__ This is what the blog looked like .
__nl__ Day One ...
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger .
__nl__ So this is where I went to where I was working .
__nl__ He looked like a security guard .
__nl__ So I just approached him .
__nl__ And I got there and said , &quot; Hey , sir , can I borrow 100 dollars from you ? &quot;
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;
__nl__ And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; Then I turned around , and I just ran .
__nl__ I looked like this kid in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense . &quot; &quot; I saw dead people .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
__nl__ You know , he wasn &apos;t that menacing .
__nl__ He was a chubby , loveable guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he invited me to explain myself .
__nl__ And I could &apos;ve said many things .
__nl__ I could &apos;ve explained , I could &apos;ve negotiated .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t do any of that .
__nl__ All I did was run .
__nl__ I felt , wow , this is like a microcosm of my life .
__nl__ Every time I felt the slightest rejection , I would just run as fast as I could .
__nl__ And you know what ?
__nl__ The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run .
__nl__ I &apos;ll stay engaged .
__nl__ Day Two : Request a &quot; &quot; burger refill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s when I went to a burger joint , I finished lunch , and I went to the cashier and said , &quot; Hi , can I get a burger refill ? &quot; ( Laughter )
__nl__ He was all confused , like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a burger refill ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like a drink refill but with a burger . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Sorry , we don &apos;t do burger refill , man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So this is where rejection happened and I could have run , but I stayed .
__nl__ I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I love your burgers , I love your joint , and if you guys do a burger refill , I will love you guys more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , I &apos;ll tell my manager about it , and maybe we &apos;ll do it , but sorry , we can &apos;t do this today . &quot; &quot; Then I left .
__nl__ And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done burger refill .
__nl__ I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , great , I &apos;m already learning things .
__nl__ This is where my life was turned upside down .
__nl__ I went to a Krispy Kreme .
__nl__ I &apos;m sure they have some here , too .
__nl__ Basically , you interlink five doughnuts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say yes , right ?
__nl__ The doughnut maker took me so seriously .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) So she put out paper , started jotting down the colors and the rings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings .
__nl__ And I was so touched .
__nl__ I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
__nl__ And that video got over five million views on Youtube .
__nl__ The world couldn &apos;t believe that either .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) You know , because of that I was in newspapers , in talk shows , in everything .
__nl__ And I became famous .
__nl__ A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is awesome . &quot; &quot; But you know , fame and notoriety did not do anything to me .
__nl__ So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground — into this research project .
__nl__ I wanted to see what I could learn .
__nl__ And then I learned a lot of things .
__nl__ I discovered so many secrets .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; Hey , can I know why ? &quot;
__nl__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard .
__nl__ I don &apos;t want to waste your flower .
__nl__ If you want to do this , go across the street and talk to Connie .
__nl__ She loves flowers . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__nl__ I went across and knocked on Connie &apos;s door .
__nl__ And she was so happy to see me .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And then half an hour later , there was this flower in Connie &apos;s backyard .
__nl__ I &apos;m sure it looks better now .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But had I left after the initial rejection , I would &apos;ve thought , well , it &apos;s because the guy didn &apos;t trust me , it &apos;s because I was crazy , because I didn &apos;t dress up well , I didn &apos;t look good .
__nl__ It was none of those .
__nl__ It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted .
__nl__ And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral , using a sales term .
__nl__ I converted a referral .
__nl__ Then one day — and I also learned that I can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes .
__nl__ So for example , one day I went to a Starbucks , and asked the manager , &quot; &quot; Hey , can I be a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Do you know those Walmart greeters ?
__nl__ I want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a good thing , actually — Actually , I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s a bad thing .
__nl__ And he was like , &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; — yeah , this is how he looked , his name is Eric — and he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; This is how he was hearing me . &quot; &quot; Not sure . &quot; &quot; Then I ask him , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s really weird , man . &quot; &quot; But as soon as he said that , his whole demeanor changed .
__nl__ It &apos;s as if he &apos;s putting all the doubt on the floor .
__nl__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you can do this , just don &apos;t get too weird . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter .
__nl__ I said &quot; &quot; hi &quot; &quot; to every customer that walked in , and gave them holiday cheers .
__nl__ By the way , I don &apos;t know what your career trajectory is , don &apos;t be a greeter .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) It was really boring .
__nl__ But then I found I could do this because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; I mentioned the doubt that he was having .
__nl__ And because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t weird .
__nl__ That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a weird thing .
__nl__ And again , and again , I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have before I ask the question , I gained their trust .
__nl__ People were more likely to say yes to me .
__nl__ And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...
__nl__ by asking .
__nl__ But it has always been my dream to actually teach something .
__nl__ So I said , &quot; &quot; What if I just ask and teach a college class ? &quot; &quot; I lived in Austin at the time , so I went to University of Texas at Austin and knocked on professors &apos; doors and said , &quot; &quot; Can I teach your class ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t get anywhere the first couple of times .
__nl__ But because I didn &apos;t run — I kept doing it — and on the third try the professor was very impressed .
__nl__ He was like , &quot; &quot; No one has done this before . &quot; &quot; And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson .
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , I can use this .
__nl__ Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll fit you in my curriculum . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was teaching a class .
__nl__ This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture .
__nl__ You know , sometimes you get rejected by lighting , you know ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But wow — when I finished teaching that class , I walked out crying , because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking .
__nl__ I used to think I have to accomplish all these things — have to be a great entrepreneur , or get a PhD to teach — but no , I just asked , and I could teach .
__nl__ And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quoted Martin Luther King , Jr .
__nl__ Why ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections .
__nl__ People like Martin Luther King , Jr . , like Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela , or even Jesus Christ .
__nl__ These people did not let rejection define them .
__nl__ They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves .
__nl__ And they embraced rejection .
__nl__ And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about rejection , and in my case , rejection was my curse , was my boogeyman .
__nl__ It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it .
__nl__ Then I started embracing it .
__nl__ I turned that into the biggest gift in my life .
__nl__ I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities .
__nl__ I use my blog , I use my talk , I use the book I just published , and I &apos;m even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection .
__nl__ When you get rejected in life , when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure , consider the possibilities .
__nl__ Don &apos;t run .
__nl__ If you just embrace them , they might become your gifts as well .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a businessman .
__nl__ But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
__nl__ So I guess I was the lucky one .
__nl__ My mother had 16 pregnancies .
__nl__ From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
__nl__ You can imagine as a child what I went through .
__nl__ Day to day , I watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
__nl__ At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
__nl__ I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
__nl__ So I completed my education , but I wanted to go to university .
__nl__ Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dormitory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
__nl__ So as a result , my father sent me to America .
__nl__ I came to America .
__nl__ I completed my education .
__nl__ And do you know that at the time I was completing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
__nl__ There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
__nl__ My family was in a refugee camp .
__nl__ So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
__nl__ I wanted them to be safe .
__nl__ But where was my heart ?
__nl__ My heart was in Afghanistan .
__nl__ Day after day , when I listened to the news , when I followed what was going on with my country , my heart was breaking up .
__nl__ I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
__nl__ I had a good job .
__nl__ I was a professor at a university .
__nl__ I earned good money .
__nl__ I had a good life .
__nl__ My family was here .
__nl__ I could live with them .
__nl__ But I wasn &apos;t happy .
__nl__ I wanted to go back home .
__nl__ So I went to the refugee camp .
__nl__ And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan , there were 7.5 million refugees . 7.5 million refugees .
__nl__ About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
__nl__ I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
__nl__ I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
__nl__ So it was a very devastating situation .
__nl__ My heart was beating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
__nl__ At that moment , we talk about momentum .
__nl__ At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
__nl__ How could I help these people ?
__nl__ I am one individual . What can I do for them ?
__nl__ But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
__nl__ It transformed me . It gave me status .
__nl__ It gave me confidence . It gave me a career .
__nl__ It helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
__nl__ But do you think it was easy ?
__nl__ No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
__nl__ And also , by Russia invading Afghanistan , people were not trusting anyone .
__nl__ It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
__nl__ Somebody who comes from the United States .
__nl__ Somebody who got educated here .
__nl__ Did they trust me ? Of course not .
__nl__ So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
__nl__ How am I going to do that ?
__nl__ I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
__nl__ I asked .
__nl__ Finally , I found one man .
__nl__ He was 80 years old .
__nl__ He was a mullah .
__nl__ In a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
__nl__ But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
__nl__ one day I was in the office in Peshawar , Pakistan .
__nl__ All of a sudden , I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , &quot; &quot; Run away , hide ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
__nl__ You &apos;re scared . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
__nl__ You know your life is on the line .
__nl__ But as a leader , you have to hold it together .
__nl__ You have to hold it together and show strength .
__nl__ So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
__nl__ So I invited them to the office .
__nl__ They came , and there were nine of them — nine Taliban .
__nl__ They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Very mean-looking people , black clothes , black turban , and they pour into my office .
__nl__ And I invited them to have a seat and have tea .
__nl__ They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
__nl__ But also I was strong , holding myself up .
__nl__ And , of course , by that time , you know how I dress — I dress from head to toe in a black hijab .
__nl__ The only thing you could see , my eyes .
__nl__ They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
__nl__ Don &apos;t you know that school is banned for girls ?
__nl__ What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
__nl__ We have some students coming , and they are all learning Koran , Holy Book .
__nl__ And you know , Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking Pashto .
__nl__ By that time , my staff poured into my office .
__nl__ They were scared to death .
__nl__ They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
__nl__ They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
__nl__ But everybody was happy to see me .
__nl__ Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Of course , I was happy to be alive .
__nl__ But also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban — of course during the Taliban there is another story .
__nl__ We went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls , 3,000 students underground , and continuously we trained .
__nl__ With the fall of the Taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
__nl__ We opened women &apos;s learning center .
__nl__ We continuously opened clinics .
__nl__ We worked with mothers and children .
__nl__ We had reproductive health training .
__nl__ We had all kinds of training that you can imagine .
__nl__ I was very happy . I was delighted with the outcome of my work .
__nl__ And one day , with four trainers and one bodyguard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
__nl__ Rifles on their shoulders , they blocked the road .
__nl__ And I told my driver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the driver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bodyguard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
__nl__ What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
__nl__ And by that time , the women are yelling and screaming inside the car .
__nl__ I am very shaken up , and I told myself , this is it .
__nl__ This time , we all are going to be killed .
__nl__ There is no doubt in my mind .
__nl__ But still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
__nl__ It &apos;s in your heart .
__nl__ You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
__nl__ So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
__nl__ My leg was shaking , and I got outside .
__nl__ And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
__nl__ They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
__nl__ We know where you are going .
__nl__ Every day you go up north here and there .
__nl__ You train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
__nl__ You build their skills . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
__nl__ What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK .
__nl__ It &apos;s a trap to me , of course .
__nl__ We only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
__nl__ They ran away home . Nobody stayed there .
__nl__ My bodyguard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
__nl__ I was shaken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
__nl__ Because we had training going on up north already .
__nl__ Hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
__nl__ So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
__nl__ And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; And I answered her .
__nl__ She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I tried to cover .
__nl__ No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
__nl__ &quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
__nl__ I told her the whole story .
__nl__ At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
__nl__ So we stopped the car .
__nl__ I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
__nl__ Today , they are the best trainers .
__nl__ They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my guides .
__nl__ Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . They are ahead , and we go .
__nl__ And they protect us .
__nl__ And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__nl__ That tells you that education transforms people .
__nl__ When you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
__nl__ We cannot only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
__nl__ So we are continuously giving training to men , and I really believe strongly .
__nl__ I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
__nl__ I just want to share this with you .
__nl__ It was a beautiful country , beautiful , peaceful country .
__nl__ We were going everywhere .
__nl__ Women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
__nl__ We never locked our doors .
__nl__ But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
__nl__ Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
__nl__ They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
__nl__ They are training to be doctors , back again .
__nl__ They are training to be teachers , and they are running businesses .
__nl__ We have one poet , Mawlānā Rūmī .
__nl__ He said that by having compassion and having love , you can conquer the world .
__nl__ And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
__nl__ Thank you very , very much .
__nl__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__nl__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__nl__ Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
__nl__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__nl__ They kill our livestock .
__nl__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__nl__ My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__nl__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__nl__ The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__nl__ So they kill the lions .
__nl__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__nl__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__nl__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__nl__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__nl__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__nl__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
__nl__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__nl__ And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
__nl__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
__nl__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__nl__ So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__nl__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__nl__ So I had an idea .
__nl__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
__nl__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__nl__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__nl__ So I set up everything .
__nl__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
__nl__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__nl__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__nl__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__nl__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__nl__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__nl__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__nl__ One of them was this grandmother .
__nl__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__nl__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__nl__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__nl__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__nl__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__nl__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__nl__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__nl__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__nl__ And here I am today .
__nl__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__nl__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__nl__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__nl__ Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__nl__ So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
__nl__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__nl__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__nl__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
__nl__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
__nl__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
__nl__ Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
__nl__ Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
__nl__ Disappears right into the background .
__nl__ So , he &apos;s bluffing . Let &apos;s do it backwards .
__nl__ One , two , three .
__nl__ Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .

__nl__ ( Applause ) Maya Penn : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon , and I &apos;ve been making animated flip books since I was three years old .
__nl__ At that age , I also learned about what an animator was .
__nl__ There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
__nl__ When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life .
__nl__ Animation and art has always been my first love .
__nl__ It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
__nl__ Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
__nl__ And thus , &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; &quot; was born .
__nl__ At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
__nl__ That started my love for technology .
__nl__ I built my first website myself in HTML , and I &apos;m learning JavaScript and Python .
__nl__ I &apos;m also working on an animated series called &quot; &quot; The Pollinators . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
__nl__ If plants aren &apos;t pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
__nl__ So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
__nl__ ( Applause ) ( Foot stomp ) ( Music ) ( Roar ) Pollinator : Deforestsaurus ! I should have known !
__nl__ I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
__nl__ ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my animations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
__nl__ Ideas can spark a movement .
__nl__ Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
__nl__ Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
__nl__ If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
__nl__ At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya &apos;s Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya &apos;s Ideas for the Planet .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
__nl__ I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
__nl__ I was greatly influenced by art , and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did , even my business .
__nl__ I would find different fabrics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scarf or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for designs .
__nl__ I noticed when I wore my creations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
__nl__ And I thought , I can start my own business .
__nl__ Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
__nl__ I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
__nl__ My mom taught me how to sew , and on my back porch , I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon , and I would write down the names and the price of each item .
__nl__ I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
__nl__ Soon , my items began selling all over the world , and I had customers in Denmark , Italy , Australia , Canada and more .
__nl__ Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
__nl__ Soon , my business really started to take off .
__nl__ Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
__nl__ Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
__nl__ I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
__nl__ My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
__nl__ For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
__nl__ These actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it .
__nl__ So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
__nl__ ( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
__nl__ I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
__nl__ But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
__nl__ It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
__nl__ That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
__nl__ Thank you , and peace and blessings .
__nl__ Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just — Ah !
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
__nl__ Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
__nl__ And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
__nl__ We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
__nl__ We go through initiation rites .
__nl__ We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
__nl__ But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
__nl__ And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
__nl__ All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
__nl__ And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
__nl__ Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
__nl__ And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
__nl__ The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
__nl__ It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
__nl__ And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
__nl__ No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
__nl__ And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
__nl__ When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
__nl__ Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
__nl__ A language is a flash of the human spirit .
__nl__ It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
__nl__ Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
__nl__ And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
__nl__ They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
__nl__ What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
__nl__ And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
__nl__ And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
__nl__ Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
__nl__ And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
__nl__ Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
__nl__ Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
__nl__ Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
__nl__ They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
__nl__ And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
__nl__ They simply listen and then begin to speak .
__nl__ Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
__nl__ In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
__nl__ They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
__nl__ They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
__nl__ But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
__nl__ They speared each other .
__nl__ 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
__nl__ We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
__nl__ Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
__nl__ In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
__nl__ In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
__nl__ On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
__nl__ It &apos;s interesting .
__nl__ If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
__nl__ Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
__nl__ There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
__nl__ But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
__nl__ So , the living give birth to the spirits .
__nl__ The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
__nl__ That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
__nl__ We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?
__nl__ So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
__nl__ Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
__nl__ Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
__nl__ In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
__nl__ To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
__nl__ The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
__nl__ And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
__nl__ And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
__nl__ It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
__nl__ Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
__nl__ Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
__nl__ Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
__nl__ There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
__nl__ Now , what does that mean ?
__nl__ It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
__nl__ Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
__nl__ What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
__nl__ I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
__nl__ That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
__nl__ Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
__nl__ It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
__nl__ This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
__nl__ What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
__nl__ This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__nl__ If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__nl__ To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
__nl__ In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes — who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
__nl__ They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
__nl__ Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
__nl__ How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
__nl__ Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
__nl__ But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
__nl__ This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
__nl__ And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
__nl__ I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
__nl__ Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
__nl__ Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
__nl__ All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
__nl__ And the problem is not technology itself .
__nl__ The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
__nl__ It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
__nl__ Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
__nl__ to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
__nl__ Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
__nl__ You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
__nl__ And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
__nl__ I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
__nl__ This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
__nl__ That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
__nl__ His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
__nl__ His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
__nl__ He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
__nl__ The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
__nl__ One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
__nl__ The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
__nl__ And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
__nl__ Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
__nl__ And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
__nl__ The Neolithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago .
__nl__ The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
__nl__ Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
__nl__ When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
__nl__ And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
__nl__ This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
__nl__ The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
__nl__ This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
__nl__ The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
__nl__ Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
__nl__ The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
__nl__ So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
__nl__ He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
__nl__ He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
__nl__ He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
__nl__ Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
__nl__ The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
__nl__ It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
__nl__ It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
__nl__ An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
__nl__ And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
__nl__ They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
__nl__ They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
__nl__ So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
__nl__ We think that polemics — ( Applause ) — we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
__nl__ 156 nations carry our television channel .
__nl__ Our magazines are read by millions .
__nl__ And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
__nl__ Thank you very much .

__nl__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__nl__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__nl__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
__nl__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__nl__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__nl__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__nl__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__nl__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__nl__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__nl__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__nl__ This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
__nl__ We made this kindergarten to be a circle .
__nl__ It &apos;s a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
__nl__ If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
__nl__ This is how the rooftop looks .
__nl__ And why did we design this ?
__nl__ The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a handrail . &quot;
__nl__ I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
__nl__ So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a handrail . &quot;
__nl__ But we could keep that idea around the trees .
__nl__ There are three trees popping through .
__nl__ And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
__nl__ But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
__nl__ They fall into the net .
__nl__ And you get more , and more , more .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
__nl__ The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
__nl__ It looks so nice from underneath .
__nl__ Monkeys in the zoo .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Feeding time .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
__nl__ And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
__nl__ And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
__nl__ You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
__nl__ But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he &apos;s putting water into his boots .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
__nl__ And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
__nl__ So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
__nl__ And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
__nl__ So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
__nl__ When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
__nl__ But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
__nl__ Because there is no boundary .
__nl__ And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
__nl__ He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
__nl__ But here , just they leave and come back .
__nl__ It &apos;s a natural process .
__nl__ And secondly , we consider noise very important .
__nl__ You know that children sleep better in noise .
__nl__ They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
__nl__ And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
__nl__ And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
__nl__ They need noise .
__nl__ And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
__nl__ You are not supposed to be in silence .
__nl__ And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
__nl__ You know , it &apos;s completely open .
__nl__ And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
__nl__ In summer you go swimming .
__nl__ The sand is 50 degrees .
__nl__ And also , you should know that you are waterproof .
__nl__ You never melt in rain .
__nl__ So , children are supposed to be outside .
__nl__ So that is how we should treat them .
__nl__ This is how they divide classrooms .
__nl__ They are supposed to help teachers .
__nl__ They don &apos;t .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
__nl__ A classroom .
__nl__ And a washbasin .
__nl__ They talk to each other around the well .
__nl__ And there are always some trees in the classroom .
__nl__ A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
__nl__ And each classroom has at least one skylight .
__nl__ And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
__nl__ This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
__nl__ The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
__nl__ And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
__nl__ So you have to consider safety .
__nl__ So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
__nl__ They tried to go in .
__nl__ He hit his head .
__nl__ He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
__nl__ He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
__nl__ And then we put other children .
__nl__ The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo , as you know .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
__nl__ Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
__nl__ And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
__nl__ This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
__nl__ Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
__nl__ And the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
__nl__ So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
__nl__ And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
__nl__ But the surprise is yet to come .
__nl__ The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
__nl__ And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
__nl__ The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
__nl__ Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
__nl__ My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
__nl__ They need to get some injury .
__nl__ And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
__nl__ I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
__nl__ And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
__nl__ Thank you very much .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
__nl__ They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
__nl__ They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
__nl__ So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
__nl__ Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
__nl__ And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
__nl__ Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
__nl__ It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
__nl__ And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
__nl__ Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
__nl__ It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
__nl__ But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
__nl__ They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
__nl__ And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
__nl__ might be answered by studying these systems .
__nl__ So that was very big .
__nl__ The second things is very hot .
__nl__ Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
__nl__ This is in false color .
__nl__ It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
__nl__ And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
__nl__ The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
__nl__ And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
__nl__ The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
__nl__ So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
__nl__ There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
__nl__ Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
__nl__ Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
__nl__ You were lied to .
__nl__ Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
__nl__ Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
__nl__ If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
__nl__ And dark matter is no exception .
__nl__ Well , how do we do this ?
__nl__ To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
__nl__ Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
__nl__ They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
__nl__ The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
__nl__ What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
__nl__ So , it &apos;s very funny .
__nl__ The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
__nl__ Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
__nl__ Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
__nl__ If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
__nl__ What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
__nl__ Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
__nl__ They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
__nl__ They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
__nl__ And , again , we want to learn more about it .
__nl__ Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
__nl__ Here is a computer simulation .
__nl__ And we need a way to simplify it .
__nl__ Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
__nl__ If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
__nl__ Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
__nl__ I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
__nl__ Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
__nl__ He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
__nl__ And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
__nl__ They are not faster horses .
__nl__ They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
__nl__ And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .

__nl__ Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
__nl__ At the time , I was cardiologist at UCLA , specializing in cardiac imaging techniques .
__nl__ The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__nl__ An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
__nl__ They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
__nl__ But occasionally , they do reach into the human medical community , particularly for some speciality consultation , and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help .
__nl__ And this procedure , which I have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that paw and that tail .
__nl__ Now most of the time , I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients .
__nl__ And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__nl__ And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
__nl__ Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
__nl__ So I started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
__nl__ Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever attended a veterinary conference ?
__nl__ For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
__nl__ I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
__nl__ Every medication that we prescribe or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
__nl__ But there &apos;s something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
__nl__ You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
__nl__ Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology .
__nl__ And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles .
__nl__ But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
__nl__ Physicians and scientists , we accept intellectually that our species , Homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
__nl__ But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
__nl__ Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
__nl__ When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
__nl__ And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
__nl__ Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
__nl__ Fear-induced heart failure .
__nl__ Around the year 2000 , human cardiologists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
__nl__ But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
__nl__ Self-injury .
__nl__ Some human patients harm themselves .
__nl__ Some pluck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
__nl__ There are birds that pluck out feathers .
__nl__ There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
__nl__ But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-injury in their self-injuring animals .
__nl__ Shouldn &apos;t this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self-injury ?
__nl__ Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis .
__nl__ In the United States and now internationally , at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
__nl__ Because it turns out , some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren &apos;t human .
__nl__ Can geographic information make you healthy ?
__nl__ In 2001 I got hit by a train .
__nl__ My train was a heart attack .
__nl__ I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
__nl__ And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
__nl__ I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
__nl__ &quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
__nl__ So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
__nl__ Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
__nl__ That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
__nl__ Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
__nl__ And you know why I understand that ?
__nl__ Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
__nl__ Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
__nl__ I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
__nl__ But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
__nl__ What does that mean , my environment ?
__nl__ Well , it can mean a lot of things .
__nl__ This is my life . These are my life places .
__nl__ We all have these .
__nl__ While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
__nl__ Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
__nl__ And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
__nl__ You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
__nl__ And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
__nl__ So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
__nl__ And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
__nl__ And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
__nl__ Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
__nl__ I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
__nl__ I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
__nl__ You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
__nl__ And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
__nl__ So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
__nl__ OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
__nl__ Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
__nl__ They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
__nl__ Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
__nl__ And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
__nl__ It was insidious and it was really happening .
__nl__ Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
__nl__ And I moved to Redlands California .
__nl__ Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
__nl__ Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
__nl__ Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
__nl__ If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
__nl__ So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
__nl__ Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
__nl__ The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
__nl__ No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
__nl__ They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
__nl__ They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
__nl__ Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
__nl__ This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
__nl__ Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
__nl__ Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
__nl__ So , how many people are in the white ?
__nl__ How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
__nl__ Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
__nl__ How many have spent it in the red places ?
__nl__ Oh , not so lucky .
__nl__ There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
__nl__ They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
__nl__ But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
__nl__ And it &apos;s not in yours either .
__nl__ So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
__nl__ He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
__nl__ And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
__nl__ And this is where he has spent most of his time .
__nl__ If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
__nl__ Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
__nl__ We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
__nl__ And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
__nl__ Did you know that data existed ?
__nl__ For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
__nl__ So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
__nl__ This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
__nl__ This might be what we end up with .
__nl__ This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
__nl__ This could be my little assessment .
__nl__ And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
__nl__ I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
__nl__ Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
__nl__ It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
__nl__ And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
__nl__ These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
__nl__ The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
__nl__ It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
__nl__ But it will also be useful for us .
__nl__ I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
__nl__ Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
__nl__ With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
__nl__ Just look at that for a minute .
__nl__ That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
__nl__ That was what he was talking about on that quote .
__nl__ And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
__nl__ So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
__nl__ So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
__nl__ And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .

__nl__ So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
__nl__ When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
__nl__ But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
__nl__ After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
__nl__ It is not important if I like the job or not .
__nl__ But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
__nl__ That is me playing my imaginary piano .
__nl__ An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
__nl__ I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
__nl__ But no adults liked the idea .
__nl__ No adults believed I was serious .
__nl__ Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
__nl__ So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
__nl__ My dream would never come true .
__nl__ I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
__nl__ But that &apos;s so unfair .
__nl__ So I was determined to find another calling .
__nl__ Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
__nl__ I turned to books .
__nl__ I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
__nl__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
__nl__ Books banned in China , of course .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
__nl__ That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
__nl__ The Bible is interesting , but strange .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
__nl__ But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
__nl__ &quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
__nl__ Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
__nl__ It offers many insights .
__nl__ For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
__nl__ It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
__nl__ A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
__nl__ Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
__nl__ It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
__nl__ There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
__nl__ Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
__nl__ So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
__nl__ So I started reading books in pairs .
__nl__ So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
__nl__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
__nl__ For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
__nl__ For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
__nl__ So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
__nl__ &#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
__nl__ For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !
__nl__ &quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
__nl__ I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
__nl__ Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
__nl__ I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
__nl__ Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
__nl__ Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
__nl__ So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
__nl__ So may books be always with you .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__nl__ I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high speeds .
__nl__ That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
__nl__ I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vuvuzela , weird jokes about octopi .
__nl__ But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stressing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
__nl__ It &apos;s been a major trending topic .
__nl__ Being a monolingual American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
__nl__ So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
__nl__ They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
__nl__ In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
__nl__ Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
__nl__ Every year , more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades .
__nl__ Ethan Zuckerman : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
__nl__ It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
__nl__ Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao .
__nl__ And it &apos;s terribly endangered .
__nl__ The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Brazilian friends tell me — is pitching in to help out .
__nl__ It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
__nl__ Now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
__nl__ In Portugese , it means &quot; &quot; Shut your mouth , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refers to this guy , Galvao Bueno , who &apos;s the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo .
__nl__ And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
__nl__ He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again .
__nl__ So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea , put up this banner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
__nl__ Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
__nl__ And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
__nl__ So as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
__nl__ The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter .
__nl__ There &apos;s more than five million of them .
__nl__ As far as national representation , 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter .
__nl__ That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
__nl__ Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
__nl__ Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
__nl__ Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
__nl__ And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
__nl__ And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space .
__nl__ It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space .
__nl__ Twitter recently did some research .
__nl__ They looked at their local population .
__nl__ They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
__nl__ That &apos;s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population .
__nl__ And again , that was very shocking to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
__nl__ And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .
__nl__ And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations .
__nl__ This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
__nl__ It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that cookout is a mostly black conversation .
__nl__ And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
__nl__ You click on that cookout tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it .
__nl__ But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
__nl__ We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend Eli Pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
__nl__ And we tend not to see that wider picture .
__nl__ Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
__nl__ If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Being Digital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
__nl__ Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
__nl__ He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
__nl__ And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of Evian water on the table .
__nl__ And Negroponte says this is crazy .
__nl__ This is the old economy .
__nl__ It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
__nl__ We &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is speedy , it &apos;s weightless .
__nl__ It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
__nl__ And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
__nl__ Now , Negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
__nl__ He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
__nl__ It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
__nl__ If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in Fiji , shipped at great expense to the United States .
__nl__ It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film .
__nl__ It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music .
__nl__ It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fiji .
__nl__ There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
__nl__ There &apos;s crackdowns on the press .
__nl__ It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
__nl__ Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
__nl__ I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
__nl__ We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
__nl__ And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like airline routes .
__nl__ It includes things like the Internet cables .
__nl__ We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
__nl__ You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bangalore later today .
__nl__ Two hops , you &apos;re in Suva , the capitol of Fiji .
__nl__ It &apos;s all right there .
__nl__ When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
__nl__ You start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
__nl__ It &apos;s extremely lumpy .
__nl__ There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
__nl__ There &apos;s basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York .
__nl__ but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
__nl__ You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
__nl__ And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
__nl__ When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
__nl__ So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
__nl__ The world is , in fact , getting more global .
__nl__ It &apos;s getting more connected .
__nl__ More of problems are global in scale .
__nl__ More of our economics is global in scale .
__nl__ And our media is less global by the day .
__nl__ If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
__nl__ That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
__nl__ And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world .
__nl__ Here &apos;s a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk .
__nl__ Alisa &apos;s the president of Public Radio International .
__nl__ And she made a cartogram , which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month .
__nl__ And you see that when you distort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S.
__nl__ and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
__nl__ And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
__nl__ And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dreadful , and I agree that it &apos;s dreadful — I &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
__nl__ When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
__nl__ It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
__nl__ Here &apos;s a map made by Mark Graham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
__nl__ A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded .
__nl__ And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
__nl__ Even within Wikipedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
__nl__ In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
__nl__ You probably won &apos;t .
__nl__ If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites .
__nl__ It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
__nl__ So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism .
__nl__ We look at the internet .
__nl__ We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
__nl__ We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
__nl__ And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red Sox scores .
__nl__ So this is a real problem — not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
__nl__ This is a problem we have to solve .
__nl__ So here &apos;s the good news .
__nl__ For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
__nl__ This is a group called Global Voices .
__nl__ This is a team of bloggers from around the world .
__nl__ Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
__nl__ We started in 2004 .
__nl__ You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
__nl__ Nor do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
__nl__ But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
__nl__ The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
__nl__ In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
__nl__ And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
__nl__ What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encouragement .
__nl__ One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
__nl__ And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
__nl__ They were doing something much simpler .
__nl__ It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
__nl__ but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
__nl__ Most independent media was shut down .
__nl__ And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
__nl__ So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
__nl__ Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak Malagasy .
__nl__ I &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
__nl__ Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
__nl__ If you &apos;re using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page .
__nl__ Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine translation of the page .
__nl__ And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dreadful with Chinese .
__nl__ And the results can be pretty funny .
__nl__ What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this .
__nl__ And if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
__nl__ There &apos;s a group right now in China called Yeeyan .
__nl__ And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
__nl__ They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
__nl__ They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
__nl__ They put it online for free .
__nl__ It &apos;s the project of a guy named Zhang Lei , who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
__nl__ And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Yeeyan ?
__nl__ Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
__nl__ My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
__nl__ So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guarantee that we &apos;re going to find it .
__nl__ When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
__nl__ We use a lot of search .
__nl__ And search is terrific if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
__nl__ But if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
__nl__ What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
__nl__ The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
__nl__ You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
__nl__ And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
__nl__ To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
__nl__ You need a guide .
__nl__ So this is Amira Al Hussaini . She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices .
__nl__ She has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
__nl__ Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
__nl__ And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of Ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
__nl__ She has to know something about what stories are available .
__nl__ Basically , she &apos;s a deejay .
__nl__ She &apos;s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
__nl__ I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
__nl__ I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience .
__nl__ I know Amira .
__nl__ I can ask her what to read .
__nl__ But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
__nl__ And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
__nl__ So once you start widening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start translating , once you start curating , you end up in some really weird places .
__nl__ This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is AfriGadget .
__nl__ And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
__nl__ And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel .
__nl__ And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conceivably care about this ? &quot;
__nl__ And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
__nl__ This is Erik Hersman . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
__nl__ He goes by the moniker White African .
__nl__ He &apos;s both a very well known American geek , but he &apos;s also Kenyan ; he was born in Sudan , grew up in Kenya .
__nl__ He is a bridge figure .
__nl__ He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
__nl__ And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
__nl__ He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
__nl__ These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
__nl__ But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
__nl__ And that &apos;s where we start talking about xenophiles .
__nl__ So if I found myself in the NFL , I suspect I would spend my off-season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hip-hop album .
__nl__ Dhani Jones , who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
__nl__ Dhani has a television show .
__nl__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , Dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
__nl__ He finds a local sporting team .
__nl__ He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
__nl__ And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing .
__nl__ It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
__nl__ For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
__nl__ For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
__nl__ But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
__nl__ The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia .
__nl__ My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TEDGlobal — is that most of you are xenophiles , whether or not you use that term .
__nl__ My challenge instead is this .
__nl__ It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
__nl__ We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have .
__nl__ We have to fix our media .
__nl__ We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
__nl__ We have to fix our immigration policy .
__nl__ We need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
__nl__ And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
__nl__ That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
__nl__ And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity .
__nl__ It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
__nl__ What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
__nl__ The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
__nl__ So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emptying out .
__nl__ The question is , why ?
__nl__ And here &apos;s the unromantic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
__nl__ And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
__nl__ They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
__nl__ They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
__nl__ They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
__nl__ One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
__nl__ They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
__nl__ Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
__nl__ What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
__nl__ Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
__nl__ There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
__nl__ One-sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
__nl__ So here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
__nl__ And here &apos;s the second punch line .
__nl__ That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
__nl__ Stars have shined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
__nl__ Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
__nl__ Guess who was the performing guest ?
__nl__ Susan Boyle .
__nl__ And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
__nl__ It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
__nl__ Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
__nl__ That was hilarious .
__nl__ So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
__nl__ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
__nl__ And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
__nl__ Well , being different is not that difficult .
__nl__ We are all different from different perspectives .
__nl__ But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
__nl__ You may have the chance to make a difference .
__nl__ My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
__nl__ I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton — it &apos;s still there .
__nl__ So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
__nl__ That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
__nl__ Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
__nl__ The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
__nl__ So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
__nl__ Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
__nl__ But actually , they were impressed by my words .
__nl__ And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
__nl__ After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
__nl__ So I was on a national television prime-time show .
__nl__ And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
__nl__ ( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
__nl__ Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
__nl__ So we do a lot of things .
__nl__ I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
__nl__ And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
__nl__ But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
__nl__ I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
__nl__ I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
__nl__ I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
__nl__ But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
__nl__ How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
__nl__ So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
__nl__ First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
__nl__ Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei — 20 years old , beautiful .
__nl__ She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
__nl__ And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
__nl__ She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
__nl__ The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
__nl__ So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
__nl__ All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
__nl__ It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
__nl__ But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
__nl__ It is still boiling .
__nl__ It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
__nl__ And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
__nl__ Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
__nl__ Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
__nl__ On Tencent , 200 million .
__nl__ The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
__nl__ About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
__nl__ And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
__nl__ But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
__nl__ So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
__nl__ So how are they different ?
__nl__ First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
__nl__ And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
__nl__ That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
__nl__ Most of them have fairly good education .
__nl__ The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
__nl__ In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
__nl__ But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
__nl__ And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
__nl__ So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
__nl__ So making a living is not that easy for young people .
__nl__ College graduates are not in short supply .
__nl__ In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
__nl__ So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
__nl__ That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
__nl__ Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
__nl__ They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
__nl__ Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
__nl__ They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
__nl__ And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
__nl__ Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
__nl__ But they died because of all different personal reasons .
__nl__ But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
__nl__ For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
__nl__ So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
__nl__ These diagrams show a more general social background .
__nl__ The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
__nl__ But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
__nl__ The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
__nl__ Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
__nl__ And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
__nl__ And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
__nl__ So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
__nl__ So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
__nl__ Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
__nl__ For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
__nl__ And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
__nl__ Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
__nl__ So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
__nl__ So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
__nl__ Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
__nl__ We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
__nl__ And guess what , we have faked beef .
__nl__ They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
__nl__ And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
__nl__ So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
__nl__ And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
__nl__ While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
__nl__ China is soon to pass the U.S.
__nl__ as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
__nl__ But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
__nl__ They &apos;re not rich at all .
__nl__ They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
__nl__ And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
__nl__ But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
__nl__ So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
__nl__ It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
__nl__ And also , people are doing good through social media .
__nl__ And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
__nl__ People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
__nl__ And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
__nl__ And here also people are helping to find missing children .
__nl__ A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
__nl__ After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
__nl__ So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
__nl__ Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
__nl__ People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
__nl__ How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
__nl__ And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
__nl__ I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
__nl__ And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
__nl__ Thank you very much .

__nl__ Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exams , your lab values , a list of medicines .
__nl__ I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
__nl__ And , it worked .
__nl__ For example , here we see Francesca Fini in her performance .
__nl__ I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
__nl__ I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
__nl__ A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
__nl__ Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
__nl__ My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re honest lies .
__nl__ I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from Pablo Picasso , &quot; &quot; We all know that Art is not truth .
__nl__ And I said , I &apos;ve got PowerPoint . Let &apos;s do a Venn diagram .
__nl__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Truth . Lies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , boom .
__nl__ All right . Venn diagram . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very helpful either .
__nl__ I used to be a summer camp counselor .
__nl__ I was in charge of the four-year-olds , which is good , because four-year-olds can &apos;t play sports , and neither can I.
__nl__ I would tell them about how , on the weekends , I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England .
__nl__ You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question .
__nl__ In my fantasy , they were svelte Russian women , but , you know , four-year-olds — you take what you can get in Berkeley , California .
__nl__ I think the pinnacle of this for me — I &apos;ll never forget this — there was this little girl named Riley . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit .
__nl__ And so Riley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
__nl__ That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of camp , I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy , and then at lunchtime , I was like , &quot; Riley , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;
__nl__ Put them in the trash can . It ruins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Riley carried that melon around with her all day , and she was so proud .
__nl__ And Riley knew she didn &apos;t grow a melon in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
__nl__ It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
__nl__ She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fiction .
__nl__ I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
__nl__ It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
__nl__ Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
__nl__ and yet we also know that they are .
__nl__ When I was a kid , I was obsessed with secret door novels , things like &quot; &quot; Narnia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land .
__nl__ There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
__nl__ After college , my first job was working behind one of these secret doors .
__nl__ This is a place called 826 Valencia .
__nl__ They have eyepatches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s springtime , pirates want to go wild .
__nl__ You don &apos;t know . Black is boring . Pastel .
__nl__ Or eyes , also in lots of colors , just glass eyes , depending on how you want to deal with that situation .
__nl__ It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
__nl__ So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
__nl__ So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
__nl__ Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
__nl__ They &apos;re from all eras , including just the 1980s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very recent past .
__nl__ There &apos;s our Employees of the Month , including Genghis Khan , Charles Dickens .
__nl__ Some great people have come up through our ranks .
__nl__ This is our kind of pharmacy section .
__nl__ Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
__nl__ Barbarian repellent . It &apos;s full of salad and potpourri — things that barbarians hate .
__nl__ Dead languages .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
__nl__ And Viking Odorant , which comes in lots of great scents : toenails , sweat and rotten vegetables , pyre ash .
__nl__ Because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield , not under your arms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emotion chips , so robots can feel love or fear .
__nl__ And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
__nl__ The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
__nl__ For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
__nl__ If I &apos;m going to break down the fourth wall , I want fiction to escape and come into the real world .
__nl__ I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
__nl__ And so I try to do this in my books .
__nl__ And here &apos;s just one example .
__nl__ This is the first book that I ever made .
__nl__ So it &apos;s delivered overnight by FedUp .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
__nl__ A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
__nl__ And kids do write in .
__nl__ So here &apos;s a letter . It says , &quot; &quot; Dear people , I bet you 10 bucks you won &apos;t send me a blue whale .
__nl__ He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
__nl__ And when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the outgoing message , it &apos;s just whale sounds and then a beep , which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound .
__nl__ And they get a picture of their whale too .
__nl__ So this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Nico &apos;s message .
__nl__ This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
__nl__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
__nl__ I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
__nl__ So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . Bye .
__nl__ Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
__nl__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
__nl__ I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
__nl__ MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
__nl__ He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
__nl__ You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that he likes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the crossword puzzles that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more message from Nico .
__nl__ This is the Christmas message from Nico .
__nl__ &#91; Beep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
__nl__ It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so busy because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a whale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a merry Christmas .
__nl__ So have a nice Christmas , and bye-bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
__nl__ His voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
__nl__ But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
__nl__ I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create .
__nl__ I feel lucky . Kids like Nico are the best readers , and they deserve the best stories we can give them .
__nl__ Thank you very much .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Phew , phew , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Usually when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scream out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
__nl__ And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( Vvvwow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Whoa ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
__nl__ Well , what I &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
__nl__ See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets — ( Portamento ) — and you can get it really low .
__nl__ And with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
__nl__ ( Tones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
__nl__ ( Flourish ... Beep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I startle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( Blip ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
__nl__ Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
__nl__ We &apos;re going to do a song by David Mash called &quot; &quot; Listen : the Words Are Gone , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ; there are so many .
__nl__ And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin .
__nl__ It was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , Léon Theremin — he also was a musician besides an inventor — he came up with the idea for making the theremin , I think , when he was working on some shortwave radios .
__nl__ And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( Screeching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pitches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now .
__nl__ And a lot of times , even kids nowadays , they &apos;ll make reference to a theremin by going , &quot; &quot; Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
__nl__ And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibrato gets out of hand .
__nl__ You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
__nl__ You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
__nl__ It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
__nl__ And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( Tone rising out of key ) — and breathing will make it ...
__nl__ ( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
__nl__ I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
__nl__ And if I go to a club and play a gig , people are like , &quot; Here , have some drinks on us ! &quot;
__nl__ And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Teetering tones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
__nl__ it &apos;s similar to being a vocalist , except instead of it coming out of your throat , you &apos;re controlling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ; you &apos;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .
__nl__ You just have to always adjust to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
__nl__ I think we will play another tune now .
__nl__ I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; Lush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__nl__ It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his &quot; &quot; I Have A Dream &quot; &quot; speech .
__nl__ But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a lasting one that remains .
__nl__ I was born in a family full of colors .
__nl__ My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone .
__nl__ He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents .
__nl__ The matriarch , my grandma , has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair .
__nl__ My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
__nl__ My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian , with a pinch of hazel and honey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
__nl__ She has two sisters .
__nl__ One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other , also adopted , more on the beige side , like a pancake .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Growing up in this family , color was never important for me .
__nl__ Outside home , however , things were different soon .
__nl__ Color had many other meanings .
__nl__ I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
__nl__ It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil .
__nl__ I was made of flesh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
__nl__ My skin was brown , and people said I was black .
__nl__ I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
__nl__ Later , when I took my cousin to school , I was usually taken for the nanny .
__nl__ By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the maid .
__nl__ I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends .
__nl__ And many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elevator .
__nl__ Because in the end , with this color and this hair , I cannot belong to some places .
__nl__ In some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
__nl__ However , something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling .
__nl__ Years later I married a Spaniard .
__nl__ But not any Spaniard .
__nl__ I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
__nl__ What will be the color of your children ?
__nl__ As you can understand , this is my last concern .
__nl__ But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
__nl__ And that is how Humanae was born .
__nl__ Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the untrue white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
__nl__ It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
__nl__ It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
__nl__ I portray the subjects in a white background .
__nl__ Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette , Pantone .
__nl__ I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
__nl__ I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain .
__nl__ The snowball started to roll .
__nl__ The project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
__nl__ just happened .
__nl__ And among them , my favorite : when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
__nl__ I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
__nl__ Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the Forbes list , to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat .
__nl__ In Paris , from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter .
__nl__ And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro .
__nl__ All kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or terminally ill .
__nl__ We all together build Humanae .
__nl__ Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
__nl__ When modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
__nl__ Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
__nl__ Or does it have to do with our origin , nationality or bank account ?
__nl__ This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
__nl__ Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people .
__nl__ It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label .
__nl__ It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
__nl__ I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
__nl__ A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me , &quot; &quot; Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence , as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway .
__nl__ So your work has a very special place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereotype , a box .
__nl__ Perhaps we should stop .
__nl__ Instead of framing , ask the individual , &apos; How would you label yourself ? &apos; Then I would say , &apos; Hi . I &apos;m Massiel .
__nl__ I &apos;m a Dominican-Dutch , I grew up in a mixed family and I &apos;m a bisexual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Besides these unexpected and touching reactions , Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields .
__nl__ Just to show you some examples , illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies .
__nl__ It &apos;s a collection of faces .
__nl__ Researchers in the fields of anthropology , physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity , optophysiology , face recognition or Alzheimer &apos;s .
__nl__ One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs , one of the most relevant political publications .
__nl__ And talking about foreign affairs , I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
__nl__ teachers .
__nl__ They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
__nl__ Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
__nl__ My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
__nl__ As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
__nl__ As an individual , as Angélica , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist .
__nl__ All the frustration , fear and loneliness that I once felt ...
__nl__ becomes love .
__nl__ The last country — the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
__nl__ We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
__nl__ That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__nl__ I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
__nl__ I feel so fortunate .
__nl__ I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
__nl__ I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
__nl__ It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
__nl__ But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
__nl__ I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
__nl__ Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
__nl__ And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
__nl__ She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Tweets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
__nl__ She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
__nl__ But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
__nl__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
__nl__ Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
__nl__ And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
__nl__ And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
__nl__ And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
__nl__ It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
__nl__ And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
__nl__ It all started back in 1977 .
__nl__ I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
__nl__ And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
__nl__ And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses — and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
__nl__ So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
__nl__ It was an experimental education program .
__nl__ It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
__nl__ And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention — kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
__nl__ And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
__nl__ And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
__nl__ There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
__nl__ And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
__nl__ Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
__nl__ She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
__nl__ There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
__nl__ And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
__nl__ So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
__nl__ His name is Chris Farina .
__nl__ Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
__nl__ Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
__nl__ ( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
__nl__ He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
__nl__ Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
__nl__ So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
__nl__ It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
__nl__ And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
__nl__ And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the eerie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
__nl__ What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
__nl__ I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
__nl__ That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
__nl__ I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
__nl__ And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
__nl__ And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
__nl__ And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
__nl__ And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
__nl__ You know the one .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
__nl__ I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
__nl__ And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
__nl__ And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
__nl__ My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
__nl__ That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
__nl__ And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
__nl__ And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
__nl__ I am one of her teaching gestures .
__nl__ And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
__nl__ And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
__nl__ It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
__nl__ And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
__nl__ I &apos;m not here alone .
__nl__ There are many people on this stage right now .
__nl__ And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
__nl__ It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
__nl__ I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
__nl__ We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
__nl__ I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
__nl__ So I thought , well they like to play games .
__nl__ I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 — but something interactive .
__nl__ And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
__nl__ And it has four Plexiglass layers .
__nl__ There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
__nl__ There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
__nl__ There are four countries around the board .
__nl__ The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
__nl__ They have different assets , commercial and military .
__nl__ And each country has a cabinet .
__nl__ There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
__nl__ I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
__nl__ I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
__nl__ There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
__nl__ There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
__nl__ And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
__nl__ So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
__nl__ I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
__nl__ And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
__nl__ There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
__nl__ If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
__nl__ So I also have in the game a saboteur — some child — it &apos;s basically a troublemaker — and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
__nl__ But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
__nl__ And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
__nl__ The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; Fourth-graders understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
__nl__ They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
__nl__ Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
__nl__ And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
__nl__ I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
__nl__ I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
__nl__ The students run the game .
__nl__ I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
__nl__ So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
__nl__ ( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
__nl__ You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
__nl__ See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
__nl__ John Hunter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
__nl__ And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
__nl__ And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
__nl__ And so I apologize to them as well .
__nl__ I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
__nl__ Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
__nl__ Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
__nl__ ( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
__nl__ ( Chatter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
__nl__ It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
__nl__ I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
__nl__ There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
__nl__ It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
__nl__ So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
__nl__ In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
__nl__ And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
__nl__ And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
__nl__ Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
__nl__ She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
__nl__ And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
__nl__ We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
__nl__ This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her girlfriends she said that .
__nl__ That &apos;s a breach there .
__nl__ And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) They are the toughest opponents .
__nl__ And we were very upset .
__nl__ I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
__nl__ But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
__nl__ So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
__nl__ Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
__nl__ She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
__nl__ Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
__nl__ That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
__nl__ I could not have designed that in teaching it .
__nl__ It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
__nl__ We have a letter in the game .
__nl__ If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
__nl__ You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
__nl__ So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
__nl__ And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County — and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
__nl__ It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
__nl__ She read two sentences .
__nl__ By the third sentence , she was in tears .
__nl__ I was in tears .
__nl__ Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
__nl__ We all lose .
__nl__ And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
__nl__ I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
__nl__ He &apos;s been in many battles .
__nl__ ( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
__nl__ I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
__nl__ But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
__nl__ One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
__nl__ And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
__nl__ JH : I get chills every time I see that .
__nl__ That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
__nl__ And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
__nl__ But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
__nl__ We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
__nl__ We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
__nl__ So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
__nl__ This is about my friend Brennan .
__nl__ We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
__nl__ The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
__nl__ Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
__nl__ The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
__nl__ He says , &quot; &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
__nl__ So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
__nl__ There was no way they could win .
__nl__ And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time — there was about a minute left — and despair just settled over the room .
__nl__ I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
__nl__ I should have gotten it so they could have won .
__nl__ They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
__nl__ I &apos;ve failed them .
__nl__ And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
__nl__ And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
__nl__ Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
__nl__ They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
__nl__ They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
__nl__ Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
__nl__ The parents were looking in the window .
__nl__ And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
__nl__ He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
__nl__ And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
__nl__ We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
__nl__ And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
__nl__ Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
__nl__ Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
__nl__ Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
__nl__ Every game we play is different .
__nl__ Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
__nl__ Some games are more about warfare .
__nl__ But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
__nl__ I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
__nl__ And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
__nl__ And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
__nl__ If only .
__nl__ And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
__nl__ I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
__nl__ He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
__nl__ His village is near Mogadishu .
__nl__ Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
__nl__ When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
__nl__ He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
__nl__ Maybe a year passes , nothing .
__nl__ One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
__nl__ He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
__nl__ He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
__nl__ He is introduced to this young woman .
__nl__ He eventually gets married .
__nl__ He starts this new life .
__nl__ He has a purpose in life .
__nl__ One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
__nl__ That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
__nl__ So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
__nl__ He was waiting .
__nl__ He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
__nl__ This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
__nl__ And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
__nl__ It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
__nl__ Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
__nl__ By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
__nl__ If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
__nl__ And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
__nl__ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
__nl__ They pretty much do nothing .
__nl__ I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Madina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
__nl__ I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
__nl__ Would I have become a terrorist ?
__nl__ I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
__nl__ I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
__nl__ We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
__nl__ One of the young men in the room was Aden .
__nl__ He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
__nl__ There were no jobs , no opportunities .
__nl__ I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
__nl__ They sought people like him out .
__nl__ But his story takes a different route .
__nl__ In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
__nl__ Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
__nl__ He started a motorbike company .
__nl__ He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
__nl__ He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
__nl__ How is this story different ?
__nl__ What makes his story different ?
__nl__ It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
__nl__ It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
__nl__ And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
__nl__ I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .
__nl__ He &apos;s actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad .
__nl__ If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
__nl__ for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
__nl__ He started a landscaping and design floral company .
__nl__ He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
__nl__ And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
__nl__ There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
__nl__ He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
__nl__ So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
__nl__ They had never really thought about starting up a business .
__nl__ They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
__nl__ He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
__nl__ He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
__nl__ They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
__nl__ So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
__nl__ They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
__nl__ Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
__nl__ For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
__nl__ It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
__nl__ Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
__nl__ I believe he is selling hope .
__nl__ His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
__nl__ He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
__nl__ These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
__nl__ So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
__nl__ I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
__nl__ So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burniss Travis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano . ( Applause )
__nl__ So the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
__nl__ It is really a sacred space .
__nl__ And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
__nl__ You really are alive right here in this moment .
__nl__ There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand .
__nl__ We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
__nl__ In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Titi Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
__nl__ Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
__nl__ You have no time for projected ideas .
__nl__ So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
__nl__ So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the bandstand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
__nl__ The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
__nl__ Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
__nl__ So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
__nl__ So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
__nl__ ( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F. ( Music )
__nl__ See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
__nl__ If you played an E.
__nl__ See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
__nl__ If you played an F # though , ( Dissonance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
__nl__ So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
__nl__ And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
__nl__ And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
__nl__ And we won &apos;t react to it .
__nl__ He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
__nl__ We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
__nl__ ( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
__nl__ The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
__nl__ It was an opportunity that was missed .
__nl__ So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
__nl__ He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
__nl__ We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
__nl__ ( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
__nl__ I ended up creating a melody out of it .
__nl__ The texture changed in the drums this time .
__nl__ It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
__nl__ So there is no mistake .
__nl__ The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
__nl__ So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
__nl__ It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
__nl__ And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
__nl__ We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
__nl__ So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
__nl__ Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
__nl__ And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micromanage in jazz .
__nl__ You have some people who do .
__nl__ But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
__nl__ If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
__nl__ ready , just play some time .
__nl__ One , two , one , two , three , four .
__nl__ ( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
__nl__ I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
__nl__ This is a science of listening .
__nl__ It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
__nl__ So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
__nl__ When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
__nl__ Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
__nl__ ( Music ) Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
__nl__ It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
__nl__ It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
__nl__ It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__nl__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
__nl__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__nl__ I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
__nl__ So most everyone watches TV .
__nl__ We like it . We like some parts of it .
__nl__ Here in America , people actually love TV .
__nl__ The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
__nl__ Okay ?
__nl__ Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
__nl__ But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
__nl__ They , in fact , berate it .
__nl__ They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
__nl__ My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
__nl__ So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
__nl__ So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
__nl__ Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
__nl__ We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
__nl__ We &apos;re talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years .
__nl__ How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
__nl__ How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
__nl__ Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
__nl__ You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .
__nl__ As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
__nl__ We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
__nl__ We feel awe , we feel pity .
__nl__ That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
__nl__ The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
__nl__ We love to watch TV .
__nl__ This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
__nl__ Animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
__nl__ So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
__nl__ Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
__nl__ I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
__nl__ Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
__nl__ So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
__nl__ We went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
__nl__ We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
__nl__ We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
__nl__ How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
__nl__ Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
__nl__ Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
__nl__ What did this mean for you ?
__nl__ So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
__nl__ But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
__nl__ And on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
__nl__ So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
__nl__ Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern .
__nl__ And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen .
__nl__ Okay , here we go .
__nl__ So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
__nl__ Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
__nl__ Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
__nl__ As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
__nl__ That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
__nl__ Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
__nl__ Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane .
__nl__ Why ?
__nl__ The Cuban Missile Crisis , JFK is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , MLK is shot , Bobby Kennedy is shot , Watergate .
__nl__ Look what happens .
__nl__ In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
__nl__ Moral ambiguity takes off .
__nl__ They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a telegenic president , is in office .
__nl__ It &apos;s trying to recover .
__nl__ But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran-Contra , the Challenger disaster , Chernobyl .
__nl__ Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
__nl__ Take a look at this .
__nl__ This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
__nl__ But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
__nl__ Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; Andy Griffith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
__nl__ This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
__nl__ Irreverence starts to rise .
__nl__ Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
__nl__ You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
__nl__ You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gomer Pyle &quot; &quot; — in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
__nl__ What &apos;s number one ?
__nl__ The socially irreverent hippie show , &quot; Rowan and Martin &apos;s Laugh-In . &quot;
__nl__ They &apos;re all living together , right .
__nl__ Viewers had responded dramatically .
__nl__ Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
__nl__ When you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ?
__nl__ It means in the 1966 television season , The &quot; &quot; Smothers Brothers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
__nl__ This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presidency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
__nl__ So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
__nl__ In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
__nl__ Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
__nl__ Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
__nl__ Now look at this .
__nl__ The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
__nl__ You have &quot; &quot; All in the Family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top-10 for the entire 70s — &quot; MAS * H. &quot;
__nl__ In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration .
__nl__ Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
__nl__ It can make me feel this ?
__nl__ It can change us ?
__nl__ So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
__nl__ Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
__nl__ This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .
__nl__ You &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
__nl__ Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
__nl__ No . In the 70s you have the bellwether show &quot; &quot; The Bionic Woman &quot; &quot; that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Million-Dollar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s Angels . &quot; &quot; Another spike in the 1980s — another spike in shows about control and power .
__nl__ What were those shows ?
__nl__ Glamorous and rich .
__nl__ &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
__nl__ Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
__nl__ So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
__nl__ Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
__nl__ Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
__nl__ The 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cheers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfeld . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
__nl__ But look : X marks the spot .
__nl__ In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succumbs to judgment once and for all .
__nl__ Why not ?
__nl__ We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
__nl__ We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
__nl__ We had 9 / 11 .
__nl__ Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
__nl__ Look what happens when we keep going .
__nl__ At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
__nl__ What do people want in their TV then ?
__nl__ I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
__nl__ Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
__nl__ No , they want judgment .
__nl__ I can vote you off the island .
__nl__ I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
__nl__ I can choose the next American Idol . You &apos;re fired .
__nl__ That &apos;s all great , right ?
__nl__ So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
__nl__ We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
__nl__ There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom .
__nl__ The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Beaver . &quot; &quot; Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
__nl__ Maude Findlay , the epitome of the irreverent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even menopause on TV .
__nl__ The 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington .
__nl__ Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .
__nl__ This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
__nl__ Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
__nl__ So to you all , the women of TEDWomen , the men of TEDWomen , the global audiences of TEDWomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
__nl__ But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
__nl__ They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as viewers , through your collective social consciences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
__nl__ So thanks very much .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
__nl__ And I &apos;ll quote three people : Vannevar Bush , Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee .
__nl__ So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
__nl__ This is Vannevar Bush .
__nl__ Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
__nl__ And in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly .
__nl__ And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
__nl__ We don &apos;t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth .
__nl__ The brain works by association .
__nl__ With one item in its thought , it snaps instantly to the next item .
__nl__ And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process .
__nl__ And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
__nl__ And the memex would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
__nl__ Now this was in 1945 .
__nl__ A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
__nl__ And nobody knew anything about it .
__nl__ So this was before the computer was invented .
__nl__ And he proposed this machine called the memex .
__nl__ And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
__nl__ So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S. Air Force officer .
__nl__ And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
__nl__ And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
__nl__ And by the mid-60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
__nl__ He built a system .
__nl__ The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
__nl__ And in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called NLS for oN-Line System .
__nl__ And this is Doug Engelbart .
__nl__ He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968 .
__nl__ What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstrated this system .
__nl__ He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
__nl__ And he works this system .
__nl__ And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
__nl__ And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
__nl__ So this is where the mouse came from as well .
__nl__ So this is Doug Engelbart .
__nl__ The trouble with Doug Engelbart &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
__nl__ So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
__nl__ But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
__nl__ And my company , OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh .
__nl__ And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
__nl__ And this began to get a head of steam .
__nl__ Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
__nl__ They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .
__nl__ The magazines started to cover it .
__nl__ Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext .
__nl__ We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version .
__nl__ And our PC version became quite mature .
__nl__ These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
__nl__ You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
__nl__ We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html .
__nl__ We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
__nl__ And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks .
__nl__ So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990 .
__nl__ And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you Ian Ritchie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
__nl__ And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
__nl__ But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day .
__nl__ And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
__nl__ I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he &apos;s not going to do this .
__nl__ So we didn &apos;t do it .
__nl__ In the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
__nl__ In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .
__nl__ In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web .
__nl__ And I saw it , and I thought , yep , that &apos;s it .
__nl__ And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in Edinburgh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker .
__nl__ So that puts me in pretty illustrious company .
__nl__ There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles .
__nl__ There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
__nl__ And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling &apos;s Harry Potter , I guess .
__nl__ On the other hand , there &apos;s Marc Andreessen who wrote the world &apos;s first browser for the World Wide Web .
__nl__ And according to Fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
__nl__ But is he happy ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
__nl__ In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
__nl__ And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
__nl__ He was not a political prisoner .
__nl__ He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
__nl__ What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
__nl__ And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
__nl__ We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
__nl__ It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
__nl__ I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
__nl__ First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
__nl__ The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
__nl__ And the third is commitment .
__nl__ So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
__nl__ Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
__nl__ And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
__nl__ My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
__nl__ And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
__nl__ The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
__nl__ And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; inaudible name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; Khrew , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have defended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
__nl__ And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
__nl__ And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
__nl__ She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
__nl__ She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d miscarried .
__nl__ And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
__nl__ But Cambodia is not alone .
__nl__ I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
__nl__ Or is it other countries ?
__nl__ But it is in so many countries .
__nl__ In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
__nl__ Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
__nl__ And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
__nl__ And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
__nl__ A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
__nl__ But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
__nl__ For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; inaudible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mumbling
__nl__ and grumbling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
__nl__ The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
__nl__ I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
__nl__ What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
__nl__ And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
__nl__ I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . Lawyers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
__nl__ Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
__nl__ But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
__nl__ So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
__nl__ And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
__nl__ And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
__nl__ The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
__nl__ It &apos;s not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
__nl__ We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
__nl__ So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
__nl__ And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
__nl__ And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
__nl__ So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
__nl__ And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
__nl__ This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
__nl__ So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
__nl__ We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
__nl__ But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
__nl__ And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
__nl__ Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
__nl__ It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
__nl__ Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
__nl__ I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice .
__nl__ Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
__nl__ So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
__nl__ So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
__nl__ You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
__nl__ Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
__nl__ And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vishna . He &apos;s a 4-year-old boy .
__nl__ He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
__nl__ But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
__nl__ And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__nl__ Doesn &apos;t say a word — just rolls away with it .
__nl__ Doesn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there .
__nl__ You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a stink .
__nl__ But there &apos;s no agenda .
__nl__ There &apos;s no information about why you were invited to the meeting .
__nl__ And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
__nl__ I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar . ( Laughter )
__nl__ It &apos;s an involuntary reflex — ding , click , bing — it &apos;s in your calendar , &quot; &quot; Gotta go , I &apos;m already late for a meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Meetings are important , right ?
__nl__ And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
__nl__ And a well-run meeting can yield really positive , actionable results .
__nl__ But between globalization and pervasive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dramatically over the last few years .
__nl__ And we &apos;re miserable . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re miserable not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good meeting , it &apos;s because of MAS , our Mindless Accept Syndrome , which is a self-inflicted wound .
__nl__ Actually , I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic .
__nl__ Let me tell you why .
__nl__ A couple of years ago , I put a video on Youtube , and in the video , I acted out every terrible conference call you &apos;ve ever been on .
__nl__ It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings .
__nl__ The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck .
__nl__ And everybody leaves very angry .
__nl__ It &apos;s kind of funny .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
__nl__ ( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__nl__ As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — Hi , who just joined ?
__nl__ Hi , it &apos;s Joe . I &apos;m working from home today .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Hi , Joe . Thanks for joining us today , great .
__nl__ I was just saying , we have a lot of people on the call we &apos;d like to get through , so let &apos;s skip the roll call and I &apos;m gonna dive right in .
__nl__ Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__nl__ As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — ( Laughter ) Hi , who just joined ?
__nl__ No ? I thought I heard a beep . ( Laughter ) Sound familiar ?
__nl__ Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
__nl__ It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
__nl__ And in fact , some of the biggest companies in the world , companies that you &apos;ve heard of but I won &apos;t name , have asked for my permission to use this video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company .
__nl__ &quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
__nl__ &quot; This is my life . &quot;
__nl__ It made me laugh until I cried .
__nl__ And cried . And I cried some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My daily life until retirement or death , sigh . &quot;
__nl__ These are real quotes and it &apos;s real sad .
__nl__ But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
__nl__ In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
__nl__ It &apos;s right at our fingertips , literally .
__nl__ It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No MAS !
__nl__ First of all , the next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , click the tentative button !
__nl__ It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
__nl__ Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
__nl__ Then , get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting .
__nl__ And if we do this often enough , and we do it respectfully , people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations .
__nl__ And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it .
__nl__ People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
__nl__ Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with .
__nl__ People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours .
__nl__ And they just might bring your chair back , too . ( Laughter ) No MAS !
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause ) .
__nl__ And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
__nl__ &quot; End with an inspiring call to action . &quot;
__nl__ No .
__nl__ That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
__nl__ In fact , if you overuse those devices , you &apos;re just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative .
__nl__ But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a ringside seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers , like these .
__nl__ And it &apos;s this : Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners &apos; minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
__nl__ Let me show you what I mean .
__nl__ Here &apos;s Haley .
__nl__ ( Video ) Presenter : Haley Van Dyck !
__nl__ They &apos;re literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns .
__nl__ And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
__nl__ There &apos;s something even more startling happening .
__nl__ Let &apos;s take a look inside Haley &apos;s brain for a moment .
__nl__ There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle .
__nl__ But look here , right here — a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea .
__nl__ And incredibly , this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
__nl__ That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds , just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .
__nl__ But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
__nl__ Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
__nl__ Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
__nl__ CA : Chimamanda Adichie — people are more than a single identity .
__nl__ CA : Your mind is teeming with ideas , and not just randomly .
__nl__ They &apos;re carefully linked together .
__nl__ Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview .
__nl__ It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
__nl__ It &apos;s how you navigate the world .
__nl__ And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
__nl__ So , for example , if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react like this .
__nl__ So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial .
__nl__ You need them to be as reliable as possible — a guide , to the scary but wonderful real world out there .
__nl__ Now , different people &apos;s worldviews can be dramatically different .
__nl__ For example , how does your worldview react when you see this image : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you look at me ?
__nl__ &quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an expert , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
__nl__ Or &quot; &quot; oppressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brainwashed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; ?
__nl__ CA : Whatever your answer , there are millions of people out there who would react very differently .
__nl__ So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
__nl__ If communicated properly , they &apos;re capable of changing , forever , how someone thinks about the world , and shaping their actions both now and well into the future .
__nl__ Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
__nl__ Ideas are complex things ; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you &apos;re most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
__nl__ You have to give context , share examples , make it vivid .
__nl__ So pick one idea , and make it the through-line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
__nl__ Two , give your listeners a reason to care .
__nl__ Curiosity .
__nl__ Stir your audience &apos;s curiosity .
__nl__ Use intriguing , provocative questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs explaining .
__nl__ If you can reveal a disconnection in someone &apos;s worldview , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
__nl__ And once you &apos;ve sparked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
__nl__ Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
__nl__ You start where they are .
__nl__ Now , metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listener already understands .
__nl__ For example , when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word processor to edit DNA .
__nl__ CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds .
__nl__ It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
__nl__ Four , here &apos;s the final tip : Make your idea worth sharing .
__nl__ By that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Who does this idea benefit ? &quot;
__nl__ And I need you to be honest with the answer .
__nl__ If the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
__nl__ But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently , then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk , one that can be a gift to them and to all of us .
__nl__ Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
__nl__ So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
__nl__ I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
__nl__ I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
__nl__ So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
__nl__ I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
__nl__ And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
__nl__ To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
__nl__ One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
__nl__ For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
__nl__ This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
__nl__ This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
__nl__ This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
__nl__ all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
__nl__ So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
__nl__ So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
__nl__ One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
__nl__ You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
__nl__ Students lack perseverance .
__nl__ They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
__nl__ There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
__nl__ And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
__nl__ This is really destructive .
__nl__ David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
__nl__ He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
__nl__ He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
__nl__ You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
__nl__ And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
__nl__ I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
__nl__ I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
__nl__ I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
__nl__ It applies equally to math .
__nl__ Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
__nl__ I believe in real life .
__nl__ And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
__nl__ I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
__nl__ And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
__nl__ When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
__nl__ And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
__nl__ You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
__nl__ So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
__nl__ Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
__nl__ It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
__nl__ But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
__nl__ I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
__nl__ You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
__nl__ You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
__nl__ So I hope you can see .
__nl__ I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
__nl__ That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
__nl__ So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
__nl__ So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
__nl__ And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
__nl__ So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
__nl__ And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
__nl__ And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
__nl__ And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
__nl__ And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
__nl__ The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
__nl__ And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
__nl__ But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
__nl__ Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
__nl__ It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
__nl__ And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
__nl__ He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
__nl__ So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
__nl__ And here &apos;s how it works .
__nl__ I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
__nl__ The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
__nl__ First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
__nl__ Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
__nl__ And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
__nl__ None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
__nl__ Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
__nl__ Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
__nl__ So now we have a water tank .
__nl__ How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
__nl__ And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
__nl__ So now we have the real deal .
__nl__ How long will it take it to fill it up ?
__nl__ And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
__nl__ And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
__nl__ It &apos;s tedious .
__nl__ Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
__nl__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
__nl__ And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
__nl__ And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
__nl__ But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
__nl__ Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
__nl__ We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
__nl__ And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
__nl__ And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
__nl__ We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
__nl__ But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
__nl__ So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
__nl__ These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
__nl__ We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
__nl__ We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
__nl__ This has been a lot of fun .
__nl__ I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
__nl__ And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
__nl__ It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
__nl__ I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
__nl__ I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
__nl__ Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
__nl__ I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
__nl__ And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
__nl__ And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
__nl__ Math makes sense of the world .
__nl__ Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
__nl__ So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
__nl__ We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
__nl__ I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
__nl__ It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
__nl__ It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
__nl__ So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
__nl__ Sort of an interesting thing .
__nl__ It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
__nl__ And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
__nl__ You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
__nl__ In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
__nl__ And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
__nl__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
__nl__ I actually went to see this one .
__nl__ There was a lot of people there .
__nl__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
__nl__ I was born and raised in North Korea .
__nl__ Although my family constantly struggled against poverty , I was always loved and cared for first , because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
__nl__ But then the great famine began in 1994 .
__nl__ I was four years old .
__nl__ My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
__nl__ I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
__nl__ Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
__nl__ For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
__nl__ On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
__nl__ But even as a child , I could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
__nl__ Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
__nl__ I saw my father wither away and die .
__nl__ In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
__nl__ Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
__nl__ It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
__nl__ But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
__nl__ I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
__nl__ Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
__nl__ My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
__nl__ My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
__nl__ But that is no way to survive .
__nl__ I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
__nl__ So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
__nl__ Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
__nl__ Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
__nl__ I was not uncommon .
__nl__ Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
__nl__ When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
__nl__ That hope kept me alive .
__nl__ I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
__nl__ I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
__nl__ But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
__nl__ Hope kept me alive .
__nl__ Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
__nl__ After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
__nl__ I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
__nl__ I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
__nl__ I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
__nl__ I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
__nl__ North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
__nl__ Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
__nl__ I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
__nl__ I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
__nl__ I was 16 years old .
__nl__ I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
__nl__ I thought more people would help me .
__nl__ But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
__nl__ I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
__nl__ By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
__nl__ Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
__nl__ I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
__nl__ Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
__nl__ And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
__nl__ Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
__nl__ My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
__nl__ At one point , my father gave up on me .
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
__nl__ But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
__nl__ So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
__nl__ I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
__nl__ I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
__nl__ But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
__nl__ And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
__nl__ When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
__nl__ I was so happy .
__nl__ I looked at him sitting next to me .
__nl__ He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
__nl__ Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
__nl__ My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
__nl__ I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
__nl__ My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
__nl__ And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
__nl__ I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
__nl__ ( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
__nl__ You have to choose to believe in hope .
__nl__ You have to make it yourself .
__nl__ In North Korea , I made it myself .
__nl__ Hope brought me to America .
__nl__ But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
__nl__ My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
__nl__ I did not come here by myself .
__nl__ I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
__nl__ Many people helped me along the way to get here .
__nl__ North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
__nl__ They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
__nl__ This is my message to you .
__nl__ Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
__nl__ Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
__nl__ My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
__nl__ In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
__nl__ A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
__nl__ But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
__nl__ I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
__nl__ Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
__nl__ AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
__nl__ Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
__nl__ I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
__nl__ And I — oh , gosh .
__nl__ I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
__nl__ I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
__nl__ And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
__nl__ AH : Sure , please .
__nl__ JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
__nl__ I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
__nl__ How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
__nl__ Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
__nl__ That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
__nl__ And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
__nl__ The reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
__nl__ So for example , in the case of Ticketmaster , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
__nl__ CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
__nl__ And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
__nl__ So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
__nl__ The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
__nl__ But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
__nl__ Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
__nl__ This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
__nl__ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
__nl__ This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
__nl__ And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
__nl__ So let me tell you what this project started .
__nl__ So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
__nl__ When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
__nl__ I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
__nl__ But then I started feeling bad .
__nl__ See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
__nl__ And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs .
__nl__ So then I started feeling bad .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
__nl__ But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
__nl__ So see , here &apos;s the thing .
__nl__ While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
__nl__ Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
__nl__ So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
__nl__ Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
__nl__ And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
__nl__ So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
__nl__ So let me explain how this works .
__nl__ So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
__nl__ Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
__nl__ Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
__nl__ Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
__nl__ You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
__nl__ Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
__nl__ It gives you an image for every page of the book .
__nl__ This is an image with text for every page of the book .
__nl__ The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
__nl__ That &apos;s using a technology called OCR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
__nl__ Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
__nl__ Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
__nl__ For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
__nl__ So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
__nl__ So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
__nl__ And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
__nl__ But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
__nl__ So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
__nl__ We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
__nl__ And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
__nl__ And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
__nl__ So this is how the system works .
__nl__ And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
__nl__ So for example , Ticketmaster .
__nl__ So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
__nl__ Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
__nl__ Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
__nl__ And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
__nl__ It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
__nl__ And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
__nl__ And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
__nl__ So funny things can happen .
__nl__ For example , we presented this word .
__nl__ It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christians &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
__nl__ But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
__nl__ So we get this . ( Text : bad christians ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Oops . ( Laughter )
__nl__ Here &apos;s another really bad one .
__nl__ JohnEdwards.com ( Text : Damn liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
__nl__ Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
__nl__ See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
__nl__ So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
__nl__ I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
__nl__ Here &apos;s how it works .
__nl__ Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
__nl__ Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
__nl__ But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
__nl__ There are tens of thousands of these .
__nl__ Some of them are very cute . ( Text : clenched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funnier .
__nl__ ( Text : stoned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg . ( Laughter )
__nl__ Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
__nl__ So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
__nl__ This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA : 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
__nl__ And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
__nl__ So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
__nl__ It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
__nl__ And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
__nl__ But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
__nl__ So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
__nl__ So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
__nl__ Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
__nl__ This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
__nl__ It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
__nl__ Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
__nl__ So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
__nl__ It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Severin Hacker .
__nl__ Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
__nl__ So I posed the question to my graduate student .
__nl__ By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
__nl__ So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
__nl__ Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
__nl__ First of all , translating the Web .
__nl__ So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
__nl__ A large fraction of it is in English .
__nl__ If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
__nl__ But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
__nl__ So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
__nl__ So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
__nl__ Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
__nl__ Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
__nl__ Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
__nl__ Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
__nl__ Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
__nl__ It makes a lot of mistakes .
__nl__ Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
__nl__ So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
__nl__ Actually it was a forum post .
__nl__ It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
__nl__ It was translated from Japanese into English .
__nl__ So I &apos;ll just let you read .
__nl__ This person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
__nl__ So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
__nl__ So he &apos;s just explaining something .
__nl__ Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
__nl__ ( Text : At often , the goat-time install a error is vomit . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
__nl__ ( Text : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the dragon ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
__nl__ ( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
__nl__ ( Text : Please apologize for your stupidity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
__nl__ So back to the question .
__nl__ So we need people to translate the whole Web .
__nl__ So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
__nl__ We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
__nl__ We could do that .
__nl__ Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
__nl__ For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
__nl__ Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
__nl__ It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
__nl__ If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
__nl__ So it would be very expensive .
__nl__ So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
__nl__ Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
__nl__ The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
__nl__ So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
__nl__ That &apos;s a big problem .
__nl__ The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
__nl__ How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
__nl__ Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
__nl__ So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
__nl__ Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
__nl__ But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
__nl__ There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
__nl__ And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals , and that is language education .
__nl__ So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
__nl__ People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
__nl__ And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
__nl__ For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
__nl__ So people really , really want to learn a new language .
__nl__ So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Duolingo — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
__nl__ And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
__nl__ So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
__nl__ There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
__nl__ We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
__nl__ And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
__nl__ And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
__nl__ But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
__nl__ Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
__nl__ First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
__nl__ We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
__nl__ People really can learn a language with it .
__nl__ And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
__nl__ So people really do learn a language .
__nl__ And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
__nl__ Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
__nl__ As opposed to learning with made-up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
__nl__ So people really do learn a language .
__nl__ But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
__nl__ So let me show you one example .
__nl__ This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
__nl__ The top is the German .
__nl__ The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
__nl__ And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
__nl__ You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
__nl__ Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
__nl__ We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
__nl__ Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
__nl__ So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
__nl__ Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
__nl__ So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
__nl__ And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
__nl__ Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
__nl__ Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
__nl__ So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
__nl__ The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
__nl__ So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
__nl__ This is totally biased towards the rich .
__nl__ Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
__nl__ So this is how we could monetize this .
__nl__ Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
__nl__ But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
__nl__ So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
__nl__ So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
__nl__ We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
__nl__ We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
__nl__ By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
__nl__ So thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
__nl__ And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
__nl__ And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians .
__nl__ She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
__nl__ And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
__nl__ But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
__nl__ The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
__nl__ Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
__nl__ So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
__nl__ Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
__nl__ In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
__nl__ And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
__nl__ Now , she had no idea what to look for .
__nl__ This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
__nl__ Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
__nl__ Had they consumed colored drinks ?
__nl__ Did they eat fish and chips ?
__nl__ Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
__nl__ What time of life had they started school ?
__nl__ And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
__nl__ By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant .
__nl__ Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
__nl__ Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
__nl__ It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
__nl__ And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
__nl__ Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 .
__nl__ People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
__nl__ In fact , she need not have hurried .
__nl__ It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women .
__nl__ The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
__nl__ A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
__nl__ Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
__nl__ So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
__nl__ So , how did she know that she was right ?
__nl__ Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
__nl__ She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
__nl__ So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
__nl__ Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
__nl__ George frankly preferred numbers to people .
__nl__ But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought disconfirmation .
__nl__ Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
__nl__ He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
__nl__ Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
__nl__ It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
__nl__ I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
__nl__ Alice and George were very good at conflict .
__nl__ They saw it as thinking .
__nl__ So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
__nl__ Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
__nl__ That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
__nl__ That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
__nl__ And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
__nl__ Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
__nl__ And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
__nl__ Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
__nl__ But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
__nl__ So how do organizations think ?
__nl__ Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
__nl__ And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
__nl__ And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
__nl__ In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
__nl__ Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
__nl__ Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
__nl__ It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
__nl__ They can &apos;t think together .
__nl__ And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
__nl__ So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
__nl__ Because it does take skill and practice , too .
__nl__ If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
__nl__ So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
__nl__ And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
__nl__ He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
__nl__ He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
__nl__ But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
__nl__ So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
__nl__ After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
__nl__ Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
__nl__ But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
__nl__ In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
__nl__ And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
__nl__ It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
__nl__ So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
__nl__ And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
__nl__ Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
__nl__ But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
__nl__ And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
__nl__ And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
__nl__ They think of him as a leader .
__nl__ So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
__nl__ Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
__nl__ It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
__nl__ I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
__nl__ I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
__nl__ The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
__nl__ It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
__nl__ But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
__nl__ Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
__nl__ But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
__nl__ Openness isn &apos;t the end .
__nl__ It &apos;s the beginning .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania .
__nl__ I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
__nl__ It was a simple machine that changed my life .
__nl__ Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
__nl__ I had never used a computer .
__nl__ I had never seen an Internet .
__nl__ On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
__nl__ My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )
__nl__ There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
__nl__ But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
__nl__ I would like to share that story today .
__nl__ We have seven children in my family .
__nl__ All sisters , excepting me .
__nl__ This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
__nl__ Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
__nl__ Like everyone else , we grew maize .
__nl__ One year our fortune turned very bad .
__nl__ In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
__nl__ Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
__nl__ My family ate one meal per day , at night .
__nl__ Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
__nl__ The food passes through our bodies .
__nl__ We drop down to nothing .
__nl__ In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
__nl__ Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
__nl__ I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
__nl__ It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
__nl__ I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
__nl__ So I went to a library .
__nl__ I read books , science books , especially physics .
__nl__ I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
__nl__ I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
__nl__ Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
__nl__ It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
__nl__ Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
__nl__ So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
__nl__ But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
__nl__ Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
__nl__ Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
__nl__ It was one light at first .
__nl__ And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
__nl__ Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
__nl__ Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
__nl__ ( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
__nl__ I had never seen an airplane before .
__nl__ I had never slept in a hotel .
__nl__ So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
__nl__ So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
__nl__ God bless .
__nl__ Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
__nl__ I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
__nl__ Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
__nl__ Thank you .

__nl__ In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
__nl__ You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
__nl__ And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
__nl__ If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
__nl__ And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
__nl__ We would never do that in our own countries .
__nl__ But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
__nl__ This is happening to us today .
__nl__ And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
__nl__ And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
__nl__ And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
__nl__ If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
__nl__ We have three main groups .
__nl__ We have online criminals .
__nl__ Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
__nl__ And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
__nl__ These guys make money .
__nl__ They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
__nl__ We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
__nl__ Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
__nl__ This is Alfred Gonzalez .
__nl__ This is Stephen Watt .
__nl__ This is Bjorn Sundin .
__nl__ This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
__nl__ These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
__nl__ The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
__nl__ Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
__nl__ And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
__nl__ And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
__nl__ In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
__nl__ The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
__nl__ They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
__nl__ Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
__nl__ So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
__nl__ And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
__nl__ This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
__nl__ DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
__nl__ It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
__nl__ Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
__nl__ And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
__nl__ And his answer was yes .
__nl__ So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
__nl__ Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
__nl__ They sell certificates .
__nl__ What do you do with certificates ?
__nl__ Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
__nl__ Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
__nl__ Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
__nl__ and issue rogue certificates .
__nl__ And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
__nl__ What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
__nl__ Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
__nl__ Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
__nl__ They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
__nl__ The company headquarters are right here .
__nl__ So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
__nl__ But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
__nl__ For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
__nl__ If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
__nl__ But today , it goes beyond that .
__nl__ They will tap your Internet connection .
__nl__ They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
__nl__ Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
__nl__ Why should I worry ?
__nl__ Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
__nl__ Privacy is implied .
__nl__ Privacy is not up for discussion .
__nl__ This is not a question between privacy against security .
__nl__ It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
__nl__ And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
__nl__ And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
__nl__ And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
__nl__ We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
__nl__ Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
__nl__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__nl__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__nl__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__nl__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__nl__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__nl__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__nl__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__nl__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__nl__ But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
__nl__ Values are a certain kind of fact .
__nl__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__nl__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__nl__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__nl__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__nl__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__nl__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__nl__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__nl__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__nl__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__nl__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
__nl__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__nl__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__nl__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__nl__ Probably not .
__nl__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__nl__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__nl__ And morality relates to these truths .
__nl__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__nl__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__nl__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__nl__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__nl__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__nl__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__nl__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__nl__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__nl__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__nl__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__nl__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__nl__ And these await our discovery .
__nl__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__nl__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__nl__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__nl__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__nl__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__nl__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
__nl__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__nl__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__nl__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__nl__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__nl__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__nl__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__nl__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
__nl__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__nl__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__nl__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__nl__ As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
__nl__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__nl__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__nl__ There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__nl__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
__nl__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__nl__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__nl__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__nl__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__nl__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__nl__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__nl__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__nl__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
__nl__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__nl__ Why would we think this ?
__nl__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__nl__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__nl__ But it clearly admits some exceptions .
__nl__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__nl__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__nl__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__nl__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__nl__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__nl__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__nl__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__nl__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__nl__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
__nl__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__nl__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
__nl__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__nl__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__nl__ Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__nl__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__nl__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__nl__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__nl__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__nl__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__nl__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__nl__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
__nl__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__nl__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__nl__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__nl__ But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__nl__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__nl__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__nl__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__nl__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__nl__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
__nl__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
__nl__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__nl__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__nl__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__nl__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__nl__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__nl__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
__nl__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__nl__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__nl__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__nl__ But this is just the point .
__nl__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__nl__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__nl__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__nl__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__nl__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__nl__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__nl__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__nl__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__nl__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__nl__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__nl__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__nl__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__nl__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__nl__ It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__nl__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__nl__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__nl__ Thank you very much .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
__nl__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__nl__ Language seems to be really important here .
__nl__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__nl__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__nl__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__nl__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
__nl__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__nl__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__nl__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
__nl__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__nl__ But can you reconcile that ?
__nl__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__nl__ Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__nl__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__nl__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__nl__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__nl__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__nl__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__nl__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__nl__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__nl__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__nl__ SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
__nl__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__nl__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__nl__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__nl__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__nl__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__nl__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
__nl__ A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
__nl__ This one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her Broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
__nl__ And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
__nl__ And after a few moments , her therapist tries a new tack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she sings , in one descending scale , she sings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
__nl__ And it &apos;s a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
__nl__ Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug , one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
__nl__ Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .
__nl__ And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
__nl__ When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
__nl__ and how late-stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
__nl__ But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
__nl__ I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
__nl__ I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes , these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with disfiguring cancers .
__nl__ I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor , that doctor without borders .
__nl__ On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
__nl__ Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
__nl__ It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
__nl__ And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
__nl__ And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic .
__nl__ It was my first audition , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
__nl__ And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra , to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
__nl__ But a year later , I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician .
__nl__ Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard , but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s , was treated with thorazine at Bellevue , and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later .
__nl__ Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The Soloist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
__nl__ And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
__nl__ Playing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
__nl__ I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
__nl__ And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill .
__nl__ But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
__nl__ There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
__nl__ And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel , I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony , bringing the light of music into the very darkest places , performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row , performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane .
__nl__ After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
__nl__ Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the footlights , out of the tuxedo tails , the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
__nl__ Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
__nl__ Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
__nl__ The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brahms , or chamber music by Beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
__nl__ And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
__nl__ And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
__nl__ I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Keats , the Romantic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
__nl__ Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
__nl__ And Keats said , &quot; &quot; Beauty is truth , and truth beauty .
__nl__ That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
__nl__ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
__nl__ I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
__nl__ I have not slept in weeks .
__nl__ Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
__nl__ Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
__nl__ So I would walk around in a daze during the day .
__nl__ I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
__nl__ In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
__nl__ Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
__nl__ My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
__nl__ And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
__nl__ But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
__nl__ And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
__nl__ Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
__nl__ And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
__nl__ This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
__nl__ How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
__nl__ And so we started talking about this .
__nl__ And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
__nl__ All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
__nl__ But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
__nl__ And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
__nl__ So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
__nl__ And the idea was to put McSweeney &apos;s — McSweeney &apos;s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
__nl__ It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
__nl__ We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
__nl__ So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
__nl__ You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
__nl__ So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this mural , that &apos;s a Chris Ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
__nl__ So we rented this space .
__nl__ And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
__nl__ You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
__nl__ You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
__nl__ It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
__nl__ We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look — while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
__nl__ And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
__nl__ Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
__nl__ You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
__nl__ A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate supply-like .
__nl__ Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
__nl__ We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
__nl__ Up at the top , you see the eyepatch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch , and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mitzvahs and whatever .
__nl__ So we opened this place . And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
__nl__ This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
__nl__ These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Practical Joking with Pirates . &quot;
__nl__ While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
__nl__ That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
__nl__ It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
__nl__ So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
__nl__ The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
__nl__ We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
__nl__ We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
__nl__ I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle .
__nl__ Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
__nl__ It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
__nl__ And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
__nl__ And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
__nl__ And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
__nl__ And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
__nl__ And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari , a longtime San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
__nl__ She took over as executive director .
__nl__ Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
__nl__ And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
__nl__ The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
__nl__ You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
__nl__ And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
__nl__ They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored .
__nl__ So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
__nl__ And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
__nl__ If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
__nl__ But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
__nl__ And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
__nl__ Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
__nl__ First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
__nl__ And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
__nl__ And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
__nl__ And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
__nl__ They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
__nl__ So there &apos;s no stigma .
__nl__ They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
__nl__ They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
__nl__ These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
__nl__ They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
__nl__ There &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at McSweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
__nl__ But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
__nl__ They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
__nl__ They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
__nl__ And that makes a happy family .
__nl__ A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
__nl__ A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
__nl__ So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
__nl__ So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
__nl__ And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster .
__nl__ And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
__nl__ The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
__nl__ So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
__nl__ Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
__nl__ So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
__nl__ This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
__nl__ You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
__nl__ So this is one of the books that they do .
__nl__ Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic . &quot;
__nl__ And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
__nl__ So then we still had more tutors to use .
__nl__ This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
__nl__ The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
__nl__ We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
__nl__ The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
__nl__ The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
__nl__ Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
__nl__ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
__nl__ We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
__nl__ Whoever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
__nl__ The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
__nl__ They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
__nl__ And that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
__nl__ So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
__nl__ Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Everett Middle School Writers &apos; Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
__nl__ It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
__nl__ This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight-Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages — English and Spanish .
__nl__ So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
__nl__ I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
__nl__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
__nl__ She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
__nl__ She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
__nl__ It &apos;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
__nl__ I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
__nl__ We had a big party at the end .
__nl__ This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
__nl__ You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
__nl__ And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
__nl__ Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
__nl__ The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
__nl__ And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
__nl__ It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
__nl__ And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
__nl__ We sell all the student books .
__nl__ Where else would you put them , right ?
__nl__ So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money .
__nl__ So it was paying the rent .
__nl__ And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
__nl__ But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
__nl__ It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
__nl__ There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
__nl__ And it became a gateway to the community .
__nl__ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
__nl__ What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
__nl__ They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
__nl__ And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
__nl__ This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
__nl__ So the store actually did really well .
__nl__ But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
__nl__ It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
__nl__ So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
__nl__ So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
__nl__ And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
__nl__ They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
__nl__ They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
__nl__ So , knowing the crime-fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company .
__nl__ This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
__nl__ And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
__nl__ So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Costco for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
__nl__ These are all handmade .
__nl__ These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
__nl__ All the packaging is done by Sam Potts .
__nl__ So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
__nl__ This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
__nl__ Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
__nl__ Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
__nl__ These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
__nl__ This is a secret identity kit .
__nl__ If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Hoboken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
__nl__ So , this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
__nl__ There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that .
__nl__ So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
__nl__ You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
__nl__ It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
__nl__ But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
__nl__ All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
__nl__ I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
__nl__ It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
__nl__ And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
__nl__ So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
__nl__ It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
__nl__ This is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
__nl__ You can read this quote .
__nl__ Addicted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
__nl__ Came in . Got this concentrated attention .
__nl__ And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
__nl__ So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
__nl__ It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
__nl__ So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
__nl__ He &apos;s now been published in five books .
__nl__ He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super-Has-Beens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Penguin Balboa , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
__nl__ And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
__nl__ He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
__nl__ There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
__nl__ So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
__nl__ This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers .
__nl__ So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-Eleven would be .
__nl__ Leeches . Mammoth chunks . They even have their own Slurpee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Order . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
__nl__ These are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pittsfield , Massachusetts ; Ink Spot in Cincinnati ; Youth Speaks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin Bat Cave in Austin ; Fighting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Roddy Doyle , this will be open in April .
__nl__ Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
__nl__ All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
__nl__ Profound leaps forward !
__nl__ And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
__nl__ I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
__nl__ I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
__nl__ We created a website .
__nl__ I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
__nl__ We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
__nl__ Always let the teachers lead the way .
__nl__ They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
__nl__ There are a million ways .
__nl__ You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
__nl__ So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
__nl__ This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
__nl__ This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
__nl__ Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
__nl__ If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
__nl__ You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
__nl__ And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
__nl__ And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureaucratically untenable .
__nl__ You can do and use the skills that you have .
__nl__ The schools need you . The teachers need you .
__nl__ Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
__nl__ Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
__nl__ You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
__nl__ Thank you so much .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
__nl__ And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
__nl__ And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day .
__nl__ And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
__nl__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hallelujah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
__nl__ My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
__nl__ But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
__nl__ I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
__nl__ And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laughed .
__nl__ And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
__nl__ And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
__nl__ Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
__nl__ My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
__nl__ It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
__nl__ That ’ s a big thing in California .
__nl__ And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
__nl__ And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
__nl__ And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
__nl__ You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
__nl__ Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
__nl__ And so I argued with people about that , I argued and I argued .
__nl__ I called my parents up .
__nl__ I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
__nl__ They ’ re back in Philadelphia .
__nl__ And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mothers are like that .
__nl__ And so , on my 27th birthday I decided , because I argued so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
__nl__ And so I did .
__nl__ I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
__nl__ And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
__nl__ And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
__nl__ Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
__nl__ And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
__nl__ And then I would launch in .
__nl__ Well , that just ended communication .
__nl__ So on this first day I actually listened .
__nl__ And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
__nl__ I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
__nl__ I didn ’ t .
__nl__ And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
__nl__ So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
__nl__ Well , that lasted 17 years .
__nl__ Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
__nl__ And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
__nl__ I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
__nl__ It ’ s only 500 miles .
__nl__ And I went into the Registrar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
__nl__ I had a newspaper clipping .
__nl__ &quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
__nl__ You don ’ t … ?
__nl__ We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
__nl__ And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
__nl__ And my father came out , he was so proud .
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor ’ s degree ?
__nl__ You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
__nl__ I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana .
__nl__ I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
__nl__ I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
__nl__ There are two stories in Montana .
__nl__ The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
__nl__ And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Register for one credit .
__nl__ You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , South America .
__nl__ So I did that .
__nl__ He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate — you ’ re matriculating , so you can use the library .
__nl__ And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
__nl__ They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
__nl__ But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
__nl__ They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
__nl__ And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
__nl__ I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
__nl__ I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
__nl__ All the students sat around and they went ...
__nl__ ( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
__nl__ They had to take that class with me .
__nl__ Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
__nl__ And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
__nl__ and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
__nl__ &quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a handsaw . &quot;
__nl__ &quot; Well , you can ’ t clearcut with a ... &quot;
__nl__ &quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
__nl__ &quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about selective forestry . &quot;
__nl__ Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
__nl__ I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
__nl__ But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
__nl__ And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
__nl__ And so I went on .
__nl__ My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
__nl__ What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hunched my shoulder , I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin .
__nl__ I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
__nl__ No one was interested in oil spills .
__nl__ But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
__nl__ And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
__nl__ My dad came out again .
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
__nl__ My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
__nl__ I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
__nl__ And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
__nl__ And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
__nl__ And I ’ m thanking you , and I &apos;m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
__nl__ And that ’ s communication .
__nl__ And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
__nl__ And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
__nl__ Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
__nl__ Well , my journey kept going on .
__nl__ My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
__nl__ I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
__nl__ I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
__nl__ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
__nl__ &quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
__nl__ How could that be , how could that be ?
__nl__ How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
__nl__ Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
__nl__ And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
__nl__ And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
__nl__ I started talking because I had studied environment .
__nl__ I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
__nl__ And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
__nl__ And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
__nl__ Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
__nl__ And so that ’ s the message that I had .
__nl__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
__nl__ This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motorized vehicles .
__nl__ I was walking through El Dorado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in Venezuela , and I don ’ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
__nl__ There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; Pasaporte , pasaporte , &quot; &quot; and with an M16 pointed at me .
__nl__ And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
__nl__ I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
__nl__ I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
__nl__ What possessed me to say this thing ?
__nl__ The road turned into the jungle .
__nl__ I didn ’ t get shot .
__nl__ And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Almighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
__nl__ It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
__nl__ I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
__nl__ The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
__nl__ Now how could that be ?
__nl__ Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
__nl__ But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
__nl__ I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador .
__nl__ I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
__nl__ And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
__nl__ You know , we can do it .
__nl__ I was going to have to change .
__nl__ And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
__nl__ I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
__nl__ I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
__nl__ But I know I needed to .
__nl__ I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
__nl__ And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
__nl__ And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
__nl__ And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
__nl__ We have to change now .
__nl__ As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists .
__nl__ So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
__nl__ And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
__nl__ So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
__nl__ Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
__nl__ So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the latest episode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — longest running soap opera , which is cricket .
__nl__ And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
__nl__ It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue .
__nl__ And like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
__nl__ And that &apos;s exactly what cricket has done .
__nl__ It &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20-over game .
__nl__ And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
__nl__ But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
__nl__ Cricket wasn &apos;t always this speed-driven generations game .
__nl__ There was a time when you played cricket , you played timeless test matches , when you played on till the game got over .
__nl__ And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March .
__nl__ And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town , which is a two-hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
__nl__ So , the match was ended in between .
__nl__ And one of the English batsmen said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__nl__ Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
__nl__ There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days , so you don &apos;t play on Sundays . And one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
__nl__ But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket : because we had about the same pace of life .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
__nl__ You fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
__nl__ And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
__nl__ The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
__nl__ Princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers .
__nl__ But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
__nl__ Take a look : You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges — that &apos;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time .
__nl__ Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
__nl__ But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
__nl__ You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket .
__nl__ And then an enormous accident took place .
__nl__ In Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
__nl__ And we won this World Cup in 1983 .
__nl__ And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game , and we played it virtually every day .
__nl__ There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere .
__nl__ But there was another big date .
__nl__ 1983 was when we won the World Cup .
__nl__ 1991 , &apos; 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
__nl__ And so we allowed multinationals into India .
__nl__ We cut customs duties , we reduced import duties , and we got all the multinationals coming in , with multinational budgets , who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
__nl__ And there are only two vehicles in India — one real , one scripted .
__nl__ The scripted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cricket .
__nl__ And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
__nl__ And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
__nl__ And so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in .
__nl__ Television started covering cricket . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
__nl__ The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
__nl__ And then another big accident happened in our cricket .
__nl__ England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
__nl__ Thank God for them .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see .
__nl__ India didn &apos;t want to play the T20 World Cup .
__nl__ But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin .
__nl__ And then something very dramatic happened .
__nl__ We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
__nl__ ( Crowd cheering ) The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder .
__nl__ Announcer : And Zishan takes it ! India wins !
__nl__ What a match for a Twenty20 final .
__nl__ India , the world champions .
__nl__ ( Cheering ) India , T20 champions .
__nl__ But what a game we had , M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air , but Misbah-ul-Haq , what a player .
__nl__ A massive , massive success : India , the world TT champions .
__nl__ Harsha Bhogle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket .
__nl__ The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) If he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
__nl__ And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
__nl__ It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
__nl__ And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
__nl__ And thankfully for all of us , the English are very good at inventing things , and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And so England invented T20 cricket , and allowed India to hijack it .
__nl__ It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T20 league .
__nl__ Six weeks , city versus city .
__nl__ It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
__nl__ One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
__nl__ The other was Indian cricket .
__nl__ Now , suddenly we had to support city leagues .
__nl__ But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West .
__nl__ America is a home of leagues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some glitzy leagues here in India . &quot;
__nl__ But was India ready for it ?
__nl__ Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized .
__nl__ It was never promoted , it was never sold — it was organized .
__nl__ And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
__nl__ All of a sudden , you had that happening .
__nl__ ( Music ) An opening ceremony to match every other .
__nl__ This was an India that was buying Corvettes . This was an India that was buying Jaguar .
__nl__ This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand &apos;s population twice over .
__nl__ So , it was a different India .
__nl__ But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
__nl__ And so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .
__nl__ Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
__nl__ ( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes .
__nl__ They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
__nl__ And so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time .
__nl__ And they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
__nl__ I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues .
__nl__ But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized .
__nl__ So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Manchester United style promotion , but very Mumbai style promotion . Take a look .
__nl__ ( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .
__nl__ All along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .
__nl__ Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot — if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn &apos;t go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad .
__nl__ This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
__nl__ And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
__nl__ So , the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago , overnight . And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X. &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Fine , you play to date X , minus one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game ,
__nl__ went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet — first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) Never would India have thought on this scale before .
__nl__ Never would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
__nl__ We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
__nl__ There is cricket and the movies .
__nl__ And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs .
__nl__ And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta .
__nl__ They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .
__nl__ And something very interesting happened .
__nl__ We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket .
__nl__ And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more .
__nl__ And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that follows — if you did well , you got a hug from Preity Zinta .
__nl__ So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching Preity Zinta .
__nl__ ( Music ) And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd .
__nl__ We &apos;d all seen matches in Kolkata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Shah Rukh , with the Bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata — not for India , but for Kolkata .
__nl__ But take a look at this .
__nl__ ( Music ) An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they &apos;d won in Kolkata .
__nl__ Can you imagine ?
__nl__ And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said ?
__nl__ ( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta &apos;s team . &quot;
__nl__ ( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pakistan in here .
__nl__ I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
__nl__ We can play cricket together , we can be friends .
__nl__ So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
__nl__ ( Applause ) There was criticism too because they said , &quot; &quot; Players are being bought and sold ?
__nl__ Are they grain ?
__nl__ Are they cattle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auction , you see .
__nl__ How do you fix a price for a player ?
__nl__ And so the auction that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so-and-so player . &quot;
__nl__ There it is .
__nl__ ( Music ) Auctioneer : Going at 1,500,000 dollars . Chennai .
__nl__ Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars .
__nl__ HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day — so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
__nl__ The best Indian players who played every test match — every one of the internationals , the top of the line players — standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year .
__nl__ Now they were getting 500,000 for six days &apos; work .
__nl__ Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , and I &apos;m earning more than the footballers , wow . &quot; &quot; And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India .
__nl__ Could you have imagined that day would come ?
__nl__ One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
__nl__ That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
__nl__ So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
__nl__ What India was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
__nl__ Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today .
__nl__ IPL became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .
__nl__ Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks .
__nl__ But we did it . You know why ?
__nl__ Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching — the huge consuming class — everybody came to watch the cricket .
__nl__ We &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in India , which is a pity , but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
__nl__ Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
__nl__ For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beggars , snake charmers , filth , Delhi belly — people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .
__nl__ And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
__nl__ Cricketers all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
__nl__ And that felt good , you know ?
__nl__ We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Delhi belly in there anymore .
__nl__ There &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules .
__nl__ Right so , finally , an English game that India usurped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
__nl__ If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
__nl__ You can &apos;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
__nl__ So that &apos;s what T20 is doing .
__nl__ Hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
__nl__ Thank you very much . Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
__nl__ They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
__nl__ Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
__nl__ All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
__nl__ And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
__nl__ The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
__nl__ The second house ever built is house number two .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
__nl__ Domo arigato gozaimashita .
__nl__ So I started working with refugees because I wanted to make a difference , and making a difference starts with telling their stories .
__nl__ Who bombed your house ?
__nl__ Who killed your son ?
__nl__ Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
__nl__ What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town , and the armed gangs were approaching your house ?
__nl__ A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn &apos;t hesitate when his life was in imminent danger .
__nl__ He took his high school diploma , and later he told me why .
__nl__ He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that diploma .
__nl__ His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; Every day , I would say to him every morning , &apos; Honey , please don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he insisted , she said , &quot; I would hug him as if it were for the last time . &quot;
__nl__ But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all afraid , but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got terrible news .
__nl__ It was time to flee .
__nl__ They left that day , right away , in their car , Hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers .
__nl__ And they would cross the border into Lebanon , where they would find peace .
__nl__ But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony .
__nl__ They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field , and this is Hany &apos;s brother Ashraf , who plays outside .
__nl__ And that day , they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world , in a country , Lebanon , that is tiny .
__nl__ It only has four million citizens , and there are one million Syrian refugees living there .
__nl__ There &apos;s not a town , a city or a village that is not host to Syrian refugees .
__nl__ Think about it this way , proportionately .
__nl__ It would be as if the entire population of Germany , 80 million people , would flee to the United States in just three years .
__nl__ Half of the entire population of Syria is now uprooted , most of them inside the country .
__nl__ Six and a half million people have fled for their lives .
__nl__ Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries , and only a small proportion , as you see , have moved on to Europe .
__nl__ What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children .
__nl__ I took this picture of this little girl .
__nl__ It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan .
__nl__ And most troubling of all is that only 20 percent of Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon .
__nl__ And yet , Syrian refugee children , all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives .
__nl__ It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred .
__nl__ I &apos;m reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq , and I met this girl , and I thought , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s beautiful , &quot; &quot; and I went up to her and asked her , &quot; Can I take your picture ? &quot;
__nl__ And she said yes , but she refused to smile .
__nl__ I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children , a generation isolated and frustrated .
__nl__ And yet , look at what they fled : utter destruction , buildings , industries , schools , roads , homes .
__nl__ Hany &apos;s home was also destroyed .
__nl__ This will need to be rebuilt by architects , by engineers , by electricians .
__nl__ Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge .
__nl__ Shouldn &apos;t this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake , the societies in exile , the refugees ?
__nl__ Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return .
__nl__ You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state .
__nl__ Well far from it .
__nl__ With wars going on and on , the average time a refugee will spend in exile is 17 years .
__nl__ We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf .
__nl__ But I &apos;ll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day .
__nl__ He said to me , &quot; If I am not a student , I am nothing . &quot;
__nl__ Hany is one of 50 million people uprooted in this world today .
__nl__ Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced .
__nl__ So while we &apos;re making sweeping progress in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes .
__nl__ And there are more and more victims .
__nl__ Every day , on average , by the end of this day , 32,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes — 32,000 people .
__nl__ They flee across borders like this one .
__nl__ We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan , and this is a typical day .
__nl__ Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats , risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe .
__nl__ This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized — most of the people drowned — and he told us , &quot; &quot; Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you , where nobody humiliates you , and where nobody kills you . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that should be the minimum .
__nl__ How about a place of healing , of learning , and even opportunity ?
__nl__ Americans and Europeans have the impression that proportionally huge numbers of refugees are coming to their country , but the reality is that 86 percent , the vast majority of refugees , are living in the developing world , in countries struggling with their own insecurity , with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty .
__nl__ So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees .
__nl__ And all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__nl__ But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive .
__nl__ We can help them thrive .
__nl__ We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end .
__nl__ Rather , as centers of excellence , where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation .
__nl__ It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m reminded of the terrible war in Somalia that has been raging on for 22 years .
__nl__ And imagine living in this camp .
__nl__ I visited this camp .
__nl__ It &apos;s in Djibouti , neighboring Somalia , and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there .
__nl__ It was dusty and it was terribly hot .
__nl__ And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter , and I went up and talked to her .
__nl__ And I asked her the questions that grown-ups ask kids , like , &quot; &quot; What is your favorite subject ? &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; &quot; And this is when her face turned blank , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I have no future .
__nl__ And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;
__nl__ And I also thought , what a waste .
__nl__ A boy named Jacob Atem had a different chance , but not before he experienced terribly tragedy .
__nl__ He watched — this is in Sudan — as his village — he was only seven years old — burned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day .
__nl__ Only his cousin survived , and the two of them walked for seven months — this is boys like him — chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs , and they finally made it to refugee camps where they found safety , and he would spend the next seven years in Kenya in a refugee camp .
__nl__ But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States , and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university .
__nl__ So I want to take you back to Hany .
__nl__ When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage , he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me .
__nl__ He wrote : &quot; &quot; I miss myself , my friends , times of reading novels or writing poems , birds and tea in the morning .
__nl__ My room , my books , myself , and everything that was making me smile .
__nl__ Oh , oh , I had so many dreams that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity .
__nl__ Leave them abandoned , and they risk exploitation and abuse , and leave them unskilled and uneducated , and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries .
__nl__ I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world .
__nl__ The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace , and it &apos;s the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence .
__nl__ Hany is at a tipping point .
__nl__ University is a luxury .
__nl__ Hany &apos;s story is a tragedy , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
__nl__ Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
__nl__ And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
__nl__ That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
__nl__ As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
__nl__ After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
__nl__ In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
__nl__ And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
__nl__ And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
__nl__ Take nothing : do no harm .
__nl__ I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
__nl__ Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
__nl__ And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
__nl__ And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
__nl__ They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
__nl__ From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
__nl__ Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
__nl__ And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
__nl__ But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
__nl__ According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
__nl__ That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
__nl__ And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
__nl__ So the equation is conceptual .
__nl__ Still it works to help us understand the problem .
__nl__ So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
__nl__ Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
__nl__ I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
__nl__ Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
__nl__ So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T2 — where it reduces impact ?
__nl__ I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
__nl__ Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
__nl__ Linear : take , make , waste .
__nl__ Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
__nl__ Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
__nl__ More carpet per man-hour .
__nl__ Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
__nl__ In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
__nl__ And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
__nl__ And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
__nl__ We have measured our progress very rigorously .
__nl__ So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
__nl__ Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
__nl__ ( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
__nl__ So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
__nl__ This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
__nl__ Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
__nl__ The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
__nl__ Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
__nl__ Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
__nl__ Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
__nl__ Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
__nl__ We have diverted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
__nl__ Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
__nl__ We call it Cool Carpet .
__nl__ And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
__nl__ Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
__nl__ You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
__nl__ It is practical , and pretty too .
__nl__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
__nl__ We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
__nl__ We call this Mission Zero .
__nl__ And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
__nl__ A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
__nl__ Here is the business case for sustainability .
__nl__ From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
__nl__ This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
__nl__ And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
__nl__ Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
__nl__ Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
__nl__ You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
__nl__ And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
__nl__ No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
__nl__ Costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
__nl__ It is a better business model .
__nl__ And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
__nl__ There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
__nl__ But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
__nl__ We literally gained market share .
__nl__ We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
__nl__ If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
__nl__ I don &apos;t think so .
__nl__ I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
__nl__ That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
__nl__ But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
__nl__ And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
__nl__ You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
__nl__ But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
__nl__ Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
__nl__ At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
__nl__ We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
__nl__ And now the challenge is in execution .
__nl__ And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
__nl__ ( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
__nl__ If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
__nl__ And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
__nl__ Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
__nl__ Who is that person ?
__nl__ Not you . Not I.
__nl__ But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
__nl__ And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
__nl__ On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
__nl__ But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
__nl__ He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
__nl__ And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
__nl__ Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
__nl__ Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
__nl__ Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
__nl__ A wise friend introduced us two .
__nl__ And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
__nl__ Knowing you has changed my thinking .
__nl__ For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
__nl__ Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
__nl__ Begin , I will .
__nl__ The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
__nl__ We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
__nl__ The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
__nl__ And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
__nl__ For you , it &apos;s your call .
__nl__ Thank you .
__nl__ ( Applause )
