__ro__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__ro__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__ro__ While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__ro__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__ro__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__ro__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__ro__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__ro__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__ro__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__ro__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__ro__ There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
__ro__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__ro__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__ro__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__ro__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__ro__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__ro__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__ro__ One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
__ro__ ( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
__ro__ Death : Adam ?
__ro__ AO : Yeah .
__ro__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
__ro__ AO : Who is this ?
__ro__ Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
__ro__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__ro__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
__ro__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__ro__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__ro__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__ro__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__ro__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__ro__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__ro__ One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__ro__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
__ro__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__ro__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__ro__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__ro__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__ro__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__ro__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__ro__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__ro__ Thank you very much .

__ro__ Thank you so much .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ People returning to work after a career break : I call them relaunchers .
__ro__ These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care , for childcare reasons , pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
__ro__ Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds : veterans , military spouses , retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats .
__ro__ Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers .
__ro__ Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high-risk proposition , and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers , especially if they &apos;ve been out for a long time .
__ro__ This disconnect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
__ro__ Now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
__ro__ This is Sami Kafala .
__ro__ He &apos;s a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children .
__ro__ The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks .
__ro__ And speaking of long career breaks , this is Mimi Kahn .
__ro__ She &apos;s a social worker in Orange County , California , who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break .
__ro__ That &apos;s the longest career break that I &apos;m aware of .
__ro__ Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O &apos;Connor took a five-year career break early in her career .
__ro__ And this is Tracy Shapiro , who took a 13-year career break .
__ro__ Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it .
__ro__ Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home , but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work , plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working .
__ro__ Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
__ro__ She was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
__ro__ I met Tracy in June of 2011 , when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around .
__ro__ The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house .
__ro__ I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversations that don &apos;t go anywhere .
__ro__ Expect that , and don &apos;t be discouraged by it .
__ro__ There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit , but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce .
__ro__ And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is frozen in time .
__ro__ What I mean by this is , when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past , the people with whom you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your career break .
__ro__ And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
__ro__ So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this .
__ro__ This is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan .
__ro__ Or here I am in the kitchen .
__ro__ But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this .
__ro__ They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work .
__ro__ There &apos;s one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break .
__ro__ And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news .
__ro__ My background is in finance , and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children .
__ro__ So I was afraid I &apos;d go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t exist anymore .
__ro__ So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again .
__ro__ I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here &apos;s why .
__ro__ We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations .
__ro__ We &apos;re in a more settled time of life .
__ro__ We have great work experience .
__ro__ We have a more mature perspective .
__ro__ We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employer &apos;s expense .
__ro__ Plus we have an energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
__ro__ On the flip side , I speak with employers , and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers .
__ro__ The first one is , employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete .
__ro__ Now , I can tell you , having been technologically obsolete myself at one point , that it &apos;s a temporary condition .
__ro__ I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3 .
__ro__ I don &apos;t know if anyone can even remember back that far , but I had to relearn it on Excel .
__ro__ It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the commands are the same .
__ro__ I found PowerPoint much more challenging , but now I use PowerPoint all the time .
__ro__ I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software .
__ro__ And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
__ro__ And they do .
__ro__ The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they &apos;re worried that relaunchers don &apos;t know what they want to do .
__ro__ That &apos;s not the employer &apos;s job .
__ro__ It &apos;s the relauncher &apos;s responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value .
__ro__ Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
__ro__ I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008 , and in 2010 , I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity , whether it was called an internship or not , but an internship-like experience , as a way for professionals to return to work .
__ro__ I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs .
__ro__ I saw a returning engineer , a nontraditional reentry candidate , apply for an entry-level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
__ro__ I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs .
__ro__ So I wrote a report about what I was seeing , and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called &quot; &quot; The 40-Year-Old Intern . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editors there for that title , and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns .
__ro__ And then , courtesy of Fox Business News , they called the concept &quot; &quot; The 50-Year-Old Intern . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals .
__ro__ And at this point , hundreds of people have participated .
__ro__ These internships are paid , and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries .
__ro__ And now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers .
__ro__ Now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
__ro__ Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews , and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over .
__ro__ This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
__ro__ Think about how far we have come .
__ro__ Before this , most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all .
__ro__ But now , not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind , but you can &apos;t even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé .
__ro__ This is the mark of real change , of true institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers , we can solve it for other career transitioners too .
__ro__ In fact , an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program .
__ro__ And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a retiree internship program .
__ro__ Different pool , same concept .
__ro__ So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro .
__ro__ Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__ro__ Well , one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy , and it was an accounting job in a finance department .
__ro__ But it was a temp job .
__ro__ The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more , but no guarantees .
__ro__ This was in the fall of 2011 .
__ro__ Tracy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
__ro__ So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role , she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best .
__ro__ Well , she ended up blowing away all of their expectations , and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and challenging , because they knew what Tracy could handle .
__ro__ Fast forward to 2015 , Tracy &apos;s been promoted .
__ro__ They &apos;ve paid for her to get her MBA at night .
__ro__ She &apos;s even hired another relauncher to work for her .
__ro__ Tracy &apos;s temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer .
__ro__ Now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
__ro__ But in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , don &apos;t hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
__ro__ Be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
__ro__ Thank you .

__ro__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__ro__ Now I work in the solar technology industry .
__ro__ And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
__ro__ ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
__ro__ It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
__ro__ Huh . Hang on a moment .
__ro__ It might take a moment to load .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
__ro__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__ro__ ( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
__ro__ Okay . ( Laughter )
__ro__ Solar technology is ...
__ro__ Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
__ro__ Okay . Thank you very much .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__ro__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__ro__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__ro__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__ro__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__ro__ Where are economic networks ?
__ro__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__ro__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__ro__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__ro__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
__ro__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__ro__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
__ro__ We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
__ro__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__ro__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__ro__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__ro__ And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
__ro__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__ro__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__ro__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__ro__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__ro__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
__ro__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__ro__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__ro__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__ro__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__ro__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
__ro__ The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__ro__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__ro__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__ro__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__ro__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__ro__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__ro__ And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
__ro__ So this is how it works .
__ro__ This is a video prototype .
__ro__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__ro__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__ro__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
__ro__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__ro__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__ro__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__ro__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__ro__ So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__ro__ So this is a very early prototype .
__ro__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__ro__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
__ro__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__ro__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__ro__ So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__ro__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__ro__ On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__ro__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__ro__ Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__ro__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__ro__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__ro__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__ro__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__ro__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__ro__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__ro__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__ro__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
__ro__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
__ro__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__ro__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__ro__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__ro__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__ro__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__ro__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__ro__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__ro__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__ro__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__ro__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__ro__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__ro__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__ro__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__ro__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__ro__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__ro__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
__ro__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__ro__ So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__ro__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__ro__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__ro__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__ro__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
__ro__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__ro__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__ro__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m really glad to be here .
__ro__ I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , because that would be a little weird .
__ro__ I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
__ro__ And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
__ro__ Or here .
__ro__ But here .
__ro__ I mean Earth .
__ro__ The interesting thing is , Earth is the only place we know of that has life — 8.7 million species .
__ro__ We &apos;ve looked other places , maybe not as hard as we should or we could , but we &apos;ve looked and haven &apos;t found any ; Earth is the only place we know of with life .
__ro__ Is Earth special ?
__ro__ To understand whether there are any planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that can support life , the first step is to understand what life here requires .
__ro__ It turns out , of all of those 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
__ro__ There are a number of different energy sources available on all planets .
__ro__ On the other side , all life needs food or nourishment .
__ro__ And this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a succulent tomato .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) However , all life on Earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements , and these elements can be found on any planetary body in our solar system .
__ro__ So that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole , the thing that &apos;s hardest to achieve .
__ro__ Not moose , but water .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Although moose would be pretty cool . ( Laughter )
__ro__ And not frozen water , and not water in a gaseous state , but liquid water .
__ro__ This is what life needs to survive , all life .
__ro__ And many solar system bodies don &apos;t have liquid water , and so we don &apos;t look there .
__ro__ So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
__ro__ So let &apos;s make the problem simpler for ourselves .
__ro__ Let &apos;s think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet .
__ro__ You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid .
__ro__ You have to be very careful with that atmosphere .
__ro__ You can &apos;t have too much atmosphere , too thick or too warm an atmosphere , because then you end up too hot like Venus , and you can &apos;t have liquid water .
__ro__ But if you have too little atmosphere and it &apos;s too thin and too cold , you end up like Mars , too cold .
__ro__ It &apos;s a Goldilocks-type problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it .
__ro__ However , I &apos;d like to remind you of two things from the Goldilocks story that we may not think about so often but that I think are really relevant here .
__ro__ Number one : if Mama Bear &apos;s bowl is too cold when Goldilocks walks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too cold ?
__ro__ Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
__ro__ And the same is true with planets .
__ro__ They &apos;re not static things . They change .
__ro__ And atmospheres do the same .
__ro__ So let me give you an example .
__ro__ This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed , and it changed in big ways .
__ro__ And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable , because the three requirements for life were present long ago .
__ro__ Where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid at the surface ?
__ro__ Well , one idea is it escaped away to space .
__ro__ And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres .
__ro__ Comets have tails that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape .
__ro__ But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time , and Mars and Earth as well .
__ro__ It &apos;s just a matter of degree and a matter of scale .
__ro__ So we &apos;d like to figure out how much escaped over time so we can explain this transition .
__ro__ Number one , sunlight .
__ro__ Yes , I &apos;m dancing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even at my wedding . ( Laughter )
__ro__ They get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming .
__ro__ A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind .
__ro__ These are particles , mass , material , spit out from the surface of the sun , and they go screaming through the solar system at 400 kilometers per second , sometimes faster during solar storms , and they go hurtling through interplanetary space towards planets and their atmospheres , and they may provide energy for atmospheric particles to escape as well .
__ro__ This is something that I &apos;m interested in , because it relates to habitability .
__ro__ I mentioned that there were two things about the Goldilocks story that I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about , and the second one is a little bit more subtle .
__ro__ If Papa Bear &apos;s bowl is too hot , and Mama Bear &apos;s bowl is too cold , shouldn &apos;t Baby Bear &apos;s bowl be even colder if we &apos;re following the trend ?
__ro__ This thing that you &apos;ve accepted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple .
__ro__ And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
__ro__ This has to play into habitability .
__ro__ But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
__ro__ Maybe it &apos;s the bowls themselves that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story , what is just right .
__ro__ Earth has one ; Venus and Mars do not .
__ro__ Magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth .
__ro__ If you have a compass , you know which way north is .
__ro__ Venus and Mars don &apos;t have that .
__ro__ Well , how might it ?
__ro__ I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And yes , my colleagues who watch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the solar wind has been equated with mucus . ( Laughter )
__ro__ Atmosphere hasn &apos;t been able to escape .
__ro__ Other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship , enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself .
__ro__ The sails may gather energy from the solar wind .
__ro__ The magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
__ro__ If you &apos;ve ever experienced them , it &apos;s magnificent .
__ro__ We know the energy is getting in .
__ro__ We &apos;re trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way .
__ro__ So I &apos;ve posed a problem for you here , but I don &apos;t have a solution yet .
__ro__ We don &apos;t have a solution .
__ro__ But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
__ro__ Well , we &apos;ve sent spacecraft to all three planets .
__ro__ Some of them are orbiting now , including the MAVEN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars , which I &apos;m involved with and which is led here , out of the University of Colorado .
__ro__ It &apos;s designed to measure atmospheric escape .
__ro__ We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth .
__ro__ Once we have that answer , why should you care ?
__ro__ I mean , I care deeply ...
__ro__ And financially as well , but deeply .
__ro__ It will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close .
__ro__ We &apos;ve gone , in 20 years , from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to investigate first .
__ro__ Any lever will help .
__ro__ We have the observations of those planets , but we just don &apos;t know which ones are habitable yet .
__ro__ It &apos;s a little bit like being trapped on a red spot — ( Laughter ) on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately wanting to know more about them , wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you .
__ro__ You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet .
__ro__ In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
__ro__ This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habitable , although very soon we may come to know of more .
__ro__ But for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red spot .
__ro__ I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
__ro__ Thanks .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I love the Internet .
__ro__ It &apos;s true .
__ro__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__ro__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__ro__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__ro__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__ro__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__ro__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__ro__ So let me show you something .
__ro__ This here is Brain .
__ro__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__ro__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__ro__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__ro__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__ro__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__ro__ All right .
__ro__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__ro__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__ro__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__ro__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__ro__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__ro__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__ro__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__ro__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__ro__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__ro__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__ro__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
__ro__ And I knocked on the door .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__ro__ Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Basit .
__ro__ Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
__ro__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__ro__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__ro__ I asked them why .
__ro__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__ro__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__ro__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__ro__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__ro__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__ro__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__ro__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__ro__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__ro__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__ro__ For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
__ro__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__ro__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__ro__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__ro__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__ro__ ( Siren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__ro__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__ro__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__ro__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__ro__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__ro__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__ro__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__ro__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__ro__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
__ro__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__ro__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__ro__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__ro__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__ro__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__ro__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__ro__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
__ro__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__ro__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__ro__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__ro__ So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
__ro__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
__ro__ Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__ro__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__ro__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__ro__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__ro__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__ro__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__ro__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__ro__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__ro__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__ro__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__ro__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__ro__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__ro__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
__ro__ We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
__ro__ These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
__ro__ They are both right now on the run .
__ro__ Nobody knows where they are .
__ro__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__ro__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__ro__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__ro__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
__ro__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
__ro__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__ro__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__ro__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__ro__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__ro__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__ro__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__ro__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__ro__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__ro__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__ro__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__ro__ How do you actually track them down ?
__ro__ Let me give you an example .
__ro__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__ro__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__ro__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__ro__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__ro__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
__ro__ It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
__ro__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__ro__ And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
__ro__ Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
__ro__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__ro__ But just keep staring at it .
__ro__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__ro__ And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
__ro__ But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
__ro__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__ro__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__ro__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__ro__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__ro__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__ro__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__ro__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
__ro__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
__ro__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__ro__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__ro__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__ro__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__ro__ And he drives a very nice car .
__ro__ In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__ro__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
__ro__ How do I know about this car ?
__ro__ Because he blogged about the car .
__ro__ He actually had a car accident .
__ro__ In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__ro__ And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
__ro__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
__ro__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
__ro__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__ro__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__ro__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__ro__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__ro__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__ro__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__ro__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__ro__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__ro__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__ro__ That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__ro__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__ro__ This is what runs everything around us .
__ro__ PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__ro__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__ro__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__ro__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__ro__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__ro__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__ro__ Everything is being run by computers .
__ro__ Everything is reliant on these computers working .
__ro__ We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__ro__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__ro__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__ro__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__ro__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__ro__ Think about all the services we have online .
__ro__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__ro__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__ro__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__ro__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__ro__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__ro__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__ro__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
__ro__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__ro__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__ro__ Thank you very much .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__ro__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__ro__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__ro__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__ro__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__ro__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__ro__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__ro__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__ro__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__ro__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__ro__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__ro__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__ro__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__ro__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__ro__ This is an illusion .
__ro__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__ro__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__ro__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__ro__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__ro__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__ro__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__ro__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__ro__ We can &apos;t .
__ro__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__ro__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__ro__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__ro__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__ro__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__ro__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__ro__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__ro__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__ro__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__ro__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__ro__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__ro__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__ro__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__ro__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__ro__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__ro__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__ro__ And what does it mean ?
__ro__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__ro__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__ro__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__ro__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__ro__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__ro__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__ro__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__ro__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__ro__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__ro__ One country , two systems .
__ro__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__ro__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__ro__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__ro__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__ro__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__ro__ What happened ?
__ro__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__ro__ One nation , one system .
__ro__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__ro__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__ro__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__ro__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__ro__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__ro__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__ro__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__ro__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__ro__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__ro__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__ro__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__ro__ So the question is , why ?
__ro__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__ro__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__ro__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__ro__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__ro__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__ro__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__ro__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__ro__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__ro__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__ro__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__ro__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__ro__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__ro__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__ro__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__ro__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__ro__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__ro__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__ro__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__ro__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__ro__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__ro__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__ro__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__ro__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__ro__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__ro__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__ro__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__ro__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__ro__ The state is everywhere in China .
__ro__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__ro__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__ro__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__ro__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__ro__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__ro__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__ro__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__ro__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__ro__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__ro__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__ro__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__ro__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__ro__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__ro__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__ro__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__ro__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__ro__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__ro__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__ro__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__ro__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__ro__ But it &apos;s not .
__ro__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__ro__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__ro__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__ro__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__ro__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__ro__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__ro__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__ro__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__ro__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__ro__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__ro__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__ro__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__ro__ And there are two consequences of this .
__ro__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__ro__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__ro__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__ro__ When did that last happen ?
__ro__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__ro__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__ro__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__ro__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__ro__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__ro__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__ro__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__ro__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__ro__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__ro__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__ro__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__ro__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__ro__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__ro__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__ro__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__ro__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__ro__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__ro__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__ro__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__ro__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__ro__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__ro__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__ro__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__ro__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__ro__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__ro__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__ro__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__ro__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__ro__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__ro__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__ro__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__ro__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__ro__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__ro__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__ro__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__ro__ By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__ro__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__ro__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__ro__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__ro__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__ro__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__ro__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__ro__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__ro__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__ro__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__ro__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__ro__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__ro__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__ro__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__ro__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__ro__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__ro__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__ro__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__ro__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__ro__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__ro__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__ro__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__ro__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__ro__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__ro__ Last .
__ro__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
__ro__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__ro__ And these are facts , guys .
__ro__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
__ro__ It &apos;s not .
__ro__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__ro__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__ro__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__ro__ We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__ro__ How did this happen ?
__ro__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__ro__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
__ro__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__ro__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__ro__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__ro__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__ro__ We don &apos;t value play .
__ro__ In fact , we devalue play .
__ro__ And we devalue it in three areas .
__ro__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__ro__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__ro__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__ro__ And instead , what do we value ?
__ro__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__ro__ To be serious .
__ro__ To be really , really serious .
__ro__ It did .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__ro__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__ro__ Heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
__ro__ I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__ro__ We have a serious meme running through .
__ro__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__ro__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__ro__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__ro__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . Iskam baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woohoo !
__ro__ But then what happens in step three ?
__ro__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
__ro__ But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__ro__ So what happens ?
__ro__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__ro__ What happens then ?
__ro__ It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__ro__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__ro__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__ro__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__ro__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__ro__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
__ro__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__ro__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__ro__ We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
__ro__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__ro__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__ro__ What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
__ro__ Autocratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__ro__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__ro__ Untrusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__ro__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.M.
__ro__ That &apos;s somehow unprofessional and bad .
__ro__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s unfulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__ro__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__ro__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__ro__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__ro__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__ro__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__ro__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__ro__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__ro__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__ro__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__ro__ And you know what ?
__ro__ Evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that aren &apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__ro__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__ro__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . Ants play .
__ro__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__ro__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__ro__ Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__ro__ Kittens play . We all know kittens play .
__ro__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__ro__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__ro__ Bears play .
__ro__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__ro__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__ro__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__ro__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__ro__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__ro__ Dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__ro__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__ro__ Yours truly : humans .
__ro__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__ro__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__ro__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__ro__ Really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__ro__ And who are the biggest neotenists ?
__ro__ Humans . We play sports .
__ro__ We do it for fun , or as Olympians , or as professionals .
__ro__ We play musical instruments .
__ro__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
__ro__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__ro__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__ro__ It is a huge benefit .
__ro__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__ro__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__ro__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__ro__ As a result , what happens ?
__ro__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__ro__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__ro__ These guys are facts .
__ro__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__ro__ These are the benefits to play .
__ro__ It is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__ro__ And if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
__ro__ We hold ourselves back .
__ro__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__ro__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__ro__ What does this world look like ?
__ro__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__ro__ It &apos;s pretty glum .
__ro__ Now imagine your workplace .
__ro__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__ro__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__ro__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__ro__ Or is it crap ? Is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
__ro__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__ro__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__ro__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__ro__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__ro__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__ro__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__ro__ In fact , play improves our work .
__ro__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__ro__ For example , it stimulates creativity .
__ro__ It increases our openness to change .
__ro__ It improves our ability to learn .
__ro__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__ro__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__ro__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__ro__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
__ro__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__ro__ Our thinking is backwards .
__ro__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__ro__ We should be celebrating play .
__ro__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__ro__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__ro__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__ro__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__ro__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__ro__ And what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
__ro__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__ro__ People , service , profit .
__ro__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__ro__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__ro__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__ro__ One , play is universal .
__ro__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__ro__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sciant .
__ro__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__ro__ Not one customer would refer us .
__ro__ I asked them all .
__ro__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__ro__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__ro__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
__ro__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__ro__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__ro__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__ro__ Basically promoting fun .
__ro__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__ro__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
__ro__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__ro__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__ro__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__ro__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__ro__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__ro__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__ro__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__ro__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__ro__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__ro__ Rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__ro__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__ro__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__ro__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__ro__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__ro__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__ro__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__ro__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__ro__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__ro__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__ro__ Let them be on the Internet .
__ro__ Let them be on instant messengers .
__ro__ Let them take long lunches .
__ro__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__ro__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__ro__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__ro__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__ro__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__ro__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__ro__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__ro__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__ro__ of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__ro__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__ro__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__ro__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__ro__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__ro__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__ro__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__ro__ So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
__ro__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__ro__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__ro__ Even the BBC and The New York Times .
__ro__ So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__ro__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__ro__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__ro__ And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
__ro__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__ro__ For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
__ro__ If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
__ro__ We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__ro__ So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
__ro__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__ro__ I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
__ro__ And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__ro__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__ro__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__ro__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__ro__ This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied .
__ro__ We make ourselves small .
__ro__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__ro__ So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
__ro__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__ro__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__ro__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__ro__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__ro__ So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
__ro__ Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__ro__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__ro__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__ro__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__ro__ There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
__ro__ So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
__ro__ So it goes both ways .
__ro__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__ro__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__ro__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__ro__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
__ro__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__ro__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__ro__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__ro__ So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__ro__ Probably not , right ?
__ro__ So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
__ro__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__ro__ Here are a couple more .
__ro__ So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
__ro__ And here are the low-power poses .
__ro__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__ro__ When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
__ro__ So this is what happens .
__ro__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__ro__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__ro__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__ro__ Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
__ro__ So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__ro__ Also , our bodies change our minds .
__ro__ And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
__ro__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__ro__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__ro__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__ro__ It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
__ro__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
__ro__ People hate this .
__ro__ We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
__ro__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__ro__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__ro__ These kinds of things .
__ro__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
__ro__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__ro__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__ro__ I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
__ro__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__ro__ I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
__ro__ I was thrown from the car .
__ro__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__ro__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__ro__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__ro__ I am an impostor .
__ro__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__ro__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__ro__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__ro__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__ro__ So she had changed .
__ro__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__ro__ Fake it till you become it .
__ro__ Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
__ro__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__ro__ Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
__ro__ So , this is two minutes .
__ro__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__ro__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__ro__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
__ro__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__ro__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__ro__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__ro__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__ro__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__ro__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__ro__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__ro__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__ro__ This is a time of need .
__ro__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__ro__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__ro__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__ro__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__ro__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__ro__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__ro__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__ro__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__ro__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__ro__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__ro__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__ro__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__ro__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__ro__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__ro__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__ro__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__ro__ The earth moved for both of them .
__ro__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__ro__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__ro__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__ro__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__ro__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__ro__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__ro__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__ro__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
__ro__ All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
__ro__ So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
__ro__ Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
__ro__ BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
__ro__ BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
__ro__ Audience : What are you reading ?
__ro__ BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
__ro__ I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
__ro__ It literally says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
__ro__ That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
__ro__ It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
__ro__ Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
__ro__ All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ow ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
__ro__ But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
__ro__ And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
__ro__ Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
__ro__ But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
__ro__ Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
__ro__ They begin with a question .
__ro__ The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
__ro__ Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
__ro__ Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
__ro__ Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
__ro__ Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
__ro__ The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
__ro__ And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
__ro__ So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
__ro__ And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
__ro__ They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
__ro__ It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
__ro__ So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
__ro__ It &apos;s play .
__ro__ Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
__ro__ Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
__ro__ Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
__ro__ Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
__ro__ Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
__ro__ It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
__ro__ So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
__ro__ That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
__ro__ So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
__ro__ And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
__ro__ Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
__ro__ The first step was to ask a question .
__ro__ Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
__ro__ So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
__ro__ So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
__ro__ So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
__ro__ Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
__ro__ She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
__ro__ Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
__ro__ Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
__ro__ So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
__ro__ Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
__ro__ But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
__ro__ So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
__ro__ Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
__ro__ Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
__ro__ But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
__ro__ AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
__ro__ We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
__ro__ They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
__ro__ Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
__ro__ What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
__ro__ It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
__ro__ It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
__ro__ So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
__ro__ ( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5C .
__ro__ Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
__ro__ Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
__ro__ BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
__ro__ Student : There &apos;s two up there .
__ro__ And three in here .
__ro__ BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
__ro__ They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
__ro__ And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
__ro__ So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
__ro__ So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
__ro__ The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
__ro__ Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
__ro__ And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
__ro__ That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
__ro__ It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
__ro__ So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
__ro__ All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
__ro__ The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
__ro__ Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
__ro__ The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
__ro__ They say no .
__ro__ So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
__ro__ And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
__ro__ What was the feedback like ?
__ro__ Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
__ro__ It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
__ro__ It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
__ro__ It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
__ro__ Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
__ro__ And I &apos;ll just read one .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
__ro__ What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
__ro__ Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
__ro__ Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
__ro__ Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
__ro__ Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
__ro__ Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
__ro__ Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
__ro__ BL : This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
__ro__ Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
__ro__ You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
__ro__ ( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
__ro__ Audience : ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
__ro__ Everyone over there shout . ( Shouts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
__ro__ Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
__ro__ That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
__ro__ Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
__ro__ So , Amy ?
__ro__ AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
__ro__ Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
__ro__ But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
__ro__ You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
__ro__ Thank you.BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__ro__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__ro__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__ro__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__ro__ So get out your pen and paper .
__ro__ Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__ro__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__ro__ There are 800 million people starving .
__ro__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__ro__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__ro__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__ro__ The lists go on and on .
__ro__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__ro__ There are many , many problems out there .
__ro__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__ro__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__ro__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__ro__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__ro__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__ro__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__ro__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__ro__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__ro__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__ro__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__ro__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__ro__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__ro__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__ro__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__ro__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__ro__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__ro__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__ro__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__ro__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__ro__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__ro__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__ro__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__ro__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__ro__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__ro__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__ro__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__ro__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__ro__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__ro__ And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__ro__ Nobody wants to do this .
__ro__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__ro__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__ro__ And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__ro__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__ro__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
__ro__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__ro__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__ro__ We have not had an idea .
__ro__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__ro__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__ro__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__ro__ It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
__ro__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__ro__ And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__ro__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
__ro__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__ro__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__ro__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__ro__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__ro__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__ro__ What would be the price ?
__ro__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__ro__ And so on .
__ro__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__ro__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
__ro__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__ro__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__ro__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__ro__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__ro__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__ro__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
__ro__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__ro__ That is what economists do .
__ro__ They prioritize .
__ro__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__ro__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__ro__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__ro__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__ro__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__ro__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__ro__ These were the bad projects .
__ro__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__ro__ This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__ro__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__ro__ Why is it it came up ?
__ro__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__ro__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__ro__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__ro__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__ro__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__ro__ What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__ro__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__ro__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__ro__ Yet it would do very little good .
__ro__ All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
__ro__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
__ro__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__ro__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__ro__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__ro__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__ro__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__ro__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__ro__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__ro__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__ro__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__ro__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__ro__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__ro__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__ro__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__ro__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__ro__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__ro__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__ro__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__ro__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__ro__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__ro__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__ro__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__ro__ This third best one was free trade .
__ro__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
__ro__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__ro__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__ro__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__ro__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
__ro__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
__ro__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
__ro__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__ro__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__ro__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__ro__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__ro__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__ro__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__ro__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__ro__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__ro__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__ro__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__ro__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__ro__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__ro__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__ro__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__ro__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__ro__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__ro__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__ro__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__ro__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__ro__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__ro__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__ro__ And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__ro__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__ro__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__ro__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__ro__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__ro__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__ro__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__ro__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__ro__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__ro__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__ro__ Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__ro__ Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
__ro__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__ro__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__ro__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__ro__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__ro__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__ro__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__ro__ The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
__ro__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__ro__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__ro__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__ro__ Since then our aid has halved .
__ro__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__ro__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__ro__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__ro__ I &apos;m all for that .
__ro__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__ro__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__ro__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__ro__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__ro__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__ro__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__ro__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__ro__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__ro__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__ro__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__ro__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__ro__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__ro__ There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
__ro__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__ro__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__ro__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__ro__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__ro__ I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
__ro__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__ro__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
__ro__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__ro__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__ro__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ The year is 1800 .
__ro__ A curious little invention is being talked about .
__ro__ It &apos;s called a microscope .
__ro__ What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
__ro__ Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
__ro__ Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . This is from London .
__ro__ Fast forward 200 years .
__ro__ We still have this monster soup around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
__ro__ Just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
__ro__ Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
__ro__ You take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
__ro__ They all have faces .
__ro__ Why is that so , that Alex in Kenya , Fatima in Bangladesh , Navjoot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
__ro__ And that &apos;s primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
__ro__ And remember that number : one billion .
__ro__ The problem lies with the microscope itself .
__ro__ Even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
__ro__ Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
__ro__ They are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
__ro__ This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India .
__ro__ Two of my students , Jim and James , traveled around India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
__ro__ We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
__ro__ We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
__ro__ And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
__ro__ What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes .
__ro__ So what is a Foldscope ?
__ro__ A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
__ro__ So , now you think , how is that possible ?
__ro__ I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
__ro__ It starts with a single sheet of paper .
__ro__ What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope .
__ro__ So , there are three stages : There is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage .
__ro__ And there are micro optics at the bottom that &apos;s actually embedded in the paper itself .
__ro__ What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
__ro__ This paper has no instructions and no languages .
__ro__ There is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
__ro__ When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an XY stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
__ro__ We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
__ro__ So this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
__ro__ You pop this in .
__ro__ There is an XY stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
__ro__ So what &apos;s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
__ro__ I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
__ro__ And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
__ro__ Another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder .
__ro__ And I &apos;m going to pick one randomly .
__ro__ This one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
__ro__ So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
__ro__ So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these setups .
__ro__ So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
__ro__ I have these two microscopes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
__ro__ What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-axis .
__ro__ You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern .
__ro__ Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
__ro__ Right there .
__ro__ All from the simple setup that I actually described .
__ro__ So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer .
__ro__ So it turns out they &apos;re waterproof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
__ro__ This also shows you how the projection scope works .
__ro__ You get to see the beam the way it &apos;s projected and bent .
__ro__ Can we get the lights back on again ?
__ro__ So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
__ro__ ( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy , which we call use-and-throw microscopy .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
__ro__ Here is a sheet of paper .
__ro__ This is when we were thinking about the idea .
__ro__ This is an A4 sheet of paper .
__ro__ These are the three stages that you actually see .
__ro__ And the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
__ro__ So that &apos;s where the lenses go .
__ro__ There are some light sources .
__ro__ And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
__ro__ So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
__ro__ So here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
__ro__ There it is , and it survives .
__ro__ So for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
__ro__ We are starting at the end of the summer .
__ro__ We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscopes .
__ro__ That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
__ro__ We &apos;ve started collecting data for malaria , Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
__ro__ And I want to leave you with this picture .
__ro__ I had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
__ro__ What are the tools that we &apos;re actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
__ro__ I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ Our world has many superheroes .
__ro__ But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
__ro__ For example , the catadores , workers who collect recyclable materials for a living .
__ro__ Catadores emerged from social inequality , unemployment , and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the waste collection system .
__ro__ Catadores provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . But they are not acknowledged for it .
__ro__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__ro__ And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
__ro__ I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
__ro__ In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças , as a new urban support for my message .
__ro__ But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
__ro__ I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide .
__ro__ And then I realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to Brazil .
__ro__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__ro__ So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças .
__ro__ Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
__ro__ But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created Pimpx , which is inspired by TEDx , and it &apos;s a simplified , do-it-yourself , crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça .
__ro__ So now everybody can join .
__ro__ Because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__ro__ Try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
__ro__ So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
__ro__ Muito obrigado , thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause ) .
__ro__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
__ro__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__ro__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__ro__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__ro__ Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__ro__ So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__ro__ This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades .
__ro__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__ro__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__ro__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__ro__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__ro__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__ro__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__ro__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__ro__ These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
__ro__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
__ro__ Everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__ro__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__ro__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__ro__ This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__ro__ So this one was taken around five .
__ro__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__ro__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__ro__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__ro__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
__ro__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__ro__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__ro__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__ro__ We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
__ro__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__ro__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__ro__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__ro__ ( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__ro__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
__ro__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__ro__ So , these are our friends in Pike Place Market , the lab .
__ro__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__ro__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__ro__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__ro__ No , no . The other way .
__ro__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__ro__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__ro__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__ro__ OK , never mind .
__ro__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__ro__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__ro__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__ro__ One of them is to take that real ...
__ro__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__ro__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__ro__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__ro__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__ro__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__ro__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__ro__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4G network from the market .
__ro__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__ro__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__ro__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__ro__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__ro__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__ro__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__ro__ So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__ro__ All right now , I &apos;ve overrun my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__ro__ Thank you all very much .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
__ro__ And let me start with this .
__ro__ This is my baseline : This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
__ro__ Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
__ro__ Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
__ro__ If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
__ro__ Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
__ro__ So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the greenish part of the picture .
__ro__ Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
__ro__ And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
__ro__ And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
__ro__ This is their baseline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
__ro__ So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
__ro__ And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the Line Islands , where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions .
__ro__ This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
__ro__ So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
__ro__ Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — overgrown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
__ro__ We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
__ro__ We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
__ro__ This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore .
__ro__ Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
__ro__ Fanning Island , 2,500 people .
__ro__ The corals are doing better here . Lots of small fish .
__ro__ This is what many divers would consider paradise .
__ro__ This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
__ro__ And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
__ro__ If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
__ro__ You can see sharks in every single dive .
__ro__ And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
__ro__ But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
__ro__ What have we learned from these places ?
__ro__ This is what we thought was natural .
__ro__ This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
__ro__ If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
__ro__ Most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
__ro__ Then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
__ro__ And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
__ro__ But this is a consequence .
__ro__ This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
__ro__ When we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
__ro__ The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
__ro__ The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more of everything .
__ro__ The size of these boxes is bigger .
__ro__ We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , more biomass of herbivores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
__ro__ They clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish .
__ro__ Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
__ro__ These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
__ro__ But still , now we have global warming .
__ro__ If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
__ro__ But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
__ro__ So how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
__ro__ Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
__ro__ In Christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
__ro__ In Fanning Island , the corals are not recovered .
__ro__ But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
__ro__ And the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
__ro__ Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
__ro__ And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
__ro__ These places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
__ro__ The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
__ro__ And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
__ro__ We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
__ro__ So if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
__ro__ Well , there are several ways .
__ro__ One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
__ro__ And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean .
__ro__ This was my baseline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
__ro__ And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
__ro__ And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
__ro__ But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
__ro__ And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
__ro__ After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
__ro__ So you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
__ro__ And this particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
__ro__ So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
__ro__ So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
__ro__ These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
__ro__ The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
__ro__ This is very substantial .
__ro__ The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
__ro__ The abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
__ro__ And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
__ro__ In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
__ro__ So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
__ro__ They reproduce . That &apos;s population biology 101 .
__ro__ If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
__ro__ And same thing for invertebrates . This is the example .
__ro__ These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
__ro__ Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
__ro__ One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
__ro__ So these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
__ro__ This is in the Bahamas : Nassau grouper .
__ro__ Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
__ro__ So the fishermen are catching more .
__ro__ You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
__ro__ So there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building resilience .
__ro__ So what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
__ro__ Reserves are like savings accounts .
__ro__ We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
__ro__ And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
__ro__ Two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
__ro__ This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a free-for-all .
__ro__ Once the most degrading fishing gear , seine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
__ro__ If you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
__ro__ But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
__ro__ Another example : Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef .
__ro__ This is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
__ro__ They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare , in one aggregation .
__ro__ Fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
__ro__ When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left .
__ro__ And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
__ro__ So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
__ro__ And with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
__ro__ It happened in many places around the Caribbean .
__ro__ And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
__ro__ Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
__ro__ So how much of this do we have ?
__ro__ If this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
__ro__ And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
__ro__ We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
__ro__ Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
__ro__ The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
__ro__ Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
__ro__ Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
__ro__ Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
__ro__ Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
__ro__ People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
__ro__ A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
__ro__ So how can we do that ?
__ro__ If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
__ro__ And how can we reach that goal ?
__ro__ Well , there are two ways of getting there .
__ro__ The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago .
__ro__ The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
__ro__ And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
__ro__ But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
__ro__ Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
__ro__ Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
__ro__ It &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
__ro__ Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
__ro__ NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
__ro__ So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
__ro__ So the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
__ro__ First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .
__ro__ It &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
__ro__ Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
__ro__ And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
__ro__ The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
__ro__ We really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
__ro__ And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
__ro__ There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
__ro__ The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
__ro__ So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric .
__ro__ Enric Sala : Thank you .
__ro__ CA : That was a masterful job of pulling things together .
__ro__ First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
__ro__ How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
__ro__ ES : Well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
__ro__ The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
__ro__ That &apos;s basically it .
__ro__ The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
__ro__ Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
__ro__ They reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
__ro__ So , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
__ro__ They are like capacitors of the system .
__ro__ CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
__ro__ So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
__ro__ ES : At least in the seas .
__ro__ What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest .
__ro__ And on land , this cannot work .
__ro__ But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
__ro__ We think this is universal .
__ro__ But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
__ro__ CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
__ro__ You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
__ro__ It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
__ro__ If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
__ro__ We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
__ro__ ES : And then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
__ro__ So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
__ro__ CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
__ro__ So thank you for those numbers .
__ro__ The last one &apos;s a personal question .
__ro__ A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
__ro__ Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
__ro__ ES : It is a spiritual experience .
__ro__ We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
__ro__ But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
__ro__ And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
__ro__ And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
__ro__ It would be just too depressing .
__ro__ CA : Well , Enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
__ro__ ES : Thank you very much .
__ro__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__ro__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__ro__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__ro__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__ro__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__ro__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__ro__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__ro__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__ro__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__ro__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__ro__ We get it in the abstract .
__ro__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__ro__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__ro__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__ro__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__ro__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__ro__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__ro__ I think this is a problem .
__ro__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__ro__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__ro__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__ro__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__ro__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__ro__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__ro__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__ro__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__ro__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__ro__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__ro__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__ro__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__ro__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__ro__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__ro__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__ro__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__ro__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__ro__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__ro__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__ro__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__ro__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__ro__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__ro__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__ro__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__ro__ I call this error blindness .
__ro__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__ro__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__ro__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__ro__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__ro__ This is not mine , by the way .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__ro__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__ro__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__ro__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__ro__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__ro__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__ro__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__ro__ Okay , so fine .
__ro__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__ro__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__ro__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__ro__ So let me tell you a story .
__ro__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__ro__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__ro__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__ro__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__ro__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__ro__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__ro__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__ro__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__ro__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__ro__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__ro__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__ro__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__ro__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__ro__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__ro__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__ro__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__ro__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__ro__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__ro__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__ro__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__ro__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__ro__ So this is a catastrophe .
__ro__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__ro__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__ro__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__ro__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__ro__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__ro__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__ro__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__ro__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__ro__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__ro__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__ro__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__ro__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__ro__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__ro__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__ro__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__ro__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__ro__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__ro__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__ro__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__ro__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__ro__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__ro__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__ro__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__ro__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__ro__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__ro__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__ro__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__ro__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__ro__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__ro__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__ro__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__ro__ And something else happened instead .
__ro__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__ro__ And something else happened instead .
__ro__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__ro__ And something else happened instead .
__ro__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__ro__ And something else happened instead .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__ro__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__ro__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__ro__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__ro__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__ro__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__ro__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__ro__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__ro__ We come up with another idea .
__ro__ We tell another story .
__ro__ We hold another conference .
__ro__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__ro__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__ro__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__ro__ So what opened my eyes ?
__ro__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__ro__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__ro__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__ro__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__ro__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__ro__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__ro__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
__ro__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__ro__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__ro__ It &apos;s tedious .
__ro__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__ro__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__ro__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__ro__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__ro__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__ro__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__ro__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__ro__ My idea is : no ! No !
__ro__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__ro__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__ro__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__ro__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__ro__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__ro__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__ro__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__ro__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__ro__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__ro__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__ro__ They know .
__ro__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__ro__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__ro__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__ro__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__ro__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__ro__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__ro__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__ro__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__ro__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__ro__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__ro__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
__ro__ I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
__ro__ Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
__ro__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__ro__ This is a Klein bottle .
__ro__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
__ro__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__ro__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
__ro__ It has wonderful properties .
__ro__ If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__ro__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__ro__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
__ro__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__ro__ This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__ro__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__ro__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__ro__ That was a month of my life .
__ro__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__ro__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__ro__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__ro__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__ro__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__ro__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
__ro__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__ro__ And it sent me back .
__ro__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__ro__ This guy over here of course is me .
__ro__ This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__ro__ Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__ro__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
__ro__ He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__ro__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__ro__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__ro__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__ro__ In the background , my bicycle .
__ro__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__ro__ Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
__ro__ We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__ro__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__ro__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
__ro__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
__ro__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__ro__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__ro__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__ro__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__ro__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__ro__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__ro__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
__ro__ I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
__ro__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__ro__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__ro__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
__ro__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__ro__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__ro__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
__ro__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__ro__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__ro__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__ro__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
__ro__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__ro__ You won &apos;t need to know trig .
__ro__ But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__ro__ None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
__ro__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__ro__ ( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__ro__ My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
__ro__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__ro__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__ro__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__ro__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__ro__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__ro__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__ro__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__ro__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__ro__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__ro__ But , probably — one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__ro__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__ro__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__ro__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__ro__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__ro__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__ro__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__ro__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__ro__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__ro__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__ro__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__ro__ It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
__ro__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__ro__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__ro__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__ro__ The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__ro__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__ro__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__ro__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__ro__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__ro__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__ro__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
__ro__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
__ro__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__ro__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
__ro__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
__ro__ But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__ro__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__ro__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__ro__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
__ro__ I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__ro__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
__ro__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__ro__ I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__ro__ Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
__ro__ And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
__ro__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__ro__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__ro__ He wants to clunk me over the head !
__ro__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
__ro__ It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
__ro__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__ro__ Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__ro__ Chases me into this room .
__ro__ The entranceway to the bell tower .
__ro__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__ro__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__ro__ I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
__ro__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__ro__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__ro__ I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
__ro__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__ro__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
__ro__ A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
__ro__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__ro__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__ro__ Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
__ro__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__ro__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__ro__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__ro__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__ro__ A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
__ro__ And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
__ro__ In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
__ro__ It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate , it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking .
__ro__ So the next morning , when I woke up on too little sleep , worrying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contractor , and the freezing temperatures , and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cortisol in my brain , my thinking was cloudy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy .
__ro__ Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
__ro__ Now , you all know what the postmortem is .
__ro__ Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
__ro__ Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
__ro__ Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
__ro__ There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
__ro__ They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
__ro__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__ro__ So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
__ro__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__ro__ For your reading glasses , a particular table .
__ro__ What about travel ?
__ro__ Now these are some rather obvious things .
__ro__ Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
__ro__ Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
__ro__ So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
__ro__ And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .
__ro__ But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , and social decision-making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts .
__ro__ But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
__ro__ So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
__ro__ I ran through the numbers myself .
__ro__ You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
__ro__ Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
__ro__ I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
__ro__ So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
__ro__ You don &apos;t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
__ro__ You might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you &apos;re practiced with this kind of thinking .
__ro__ Remember , our brain under stress releases cortisol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down .
__ro__ There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
__ro__ I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
__ro__ We all are going to fail now and then .
__ro__ The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
__ro__ And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
__ro__ So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a gradual process , and I &apos;m getting there .
__ro__ Thank you very much .
__ro__ Good morning !
__ro__ Are you awake ?
__ro__ They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
__ro__ Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
__ro__ Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
__ro__ So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
__ro__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
__ro__ He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
__ro__ He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
__ro__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__ro__ He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
__ro__ What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
__ro__ Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
__ro__ How could she speak that way ?
__ro__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__ro__ It made me mad .
__ro__ It definitely hurts !
__ro__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__ro__ Where could this happen ?
__ro__ How did we get here ?
__ro__ Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
__ro__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__ro__ Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
__ro__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
__ro__ To be one of them ?
__ro__ Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
__ro__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__ro__ I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
__ro__ The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
__ro__ It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
__ro__ If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
__ro__ Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
__ro__ So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
__ro__ This is one reality .
__ro__ But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
__ro__ Arabic is the mother tongue .
__ro__ Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
__ro__ Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
__ro__ How ?
__ro__ Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
__ro__ All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
__ro__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
__ro__ Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
__ro__ You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
__ro__ So , this is an example no one can argue with .
__ro__ Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
__ro__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__ro__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__ro__ That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
__ro__ They make it sacred .
__ro__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__ro__ Do we know better than them ?
__ro__ All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
__ro__ Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
__ro__ They kept it close to them .
__ro__ Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
__ro__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__ro__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__ro__ So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
__ro__ If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this remind you of ?
__ro__ It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
__ro__ Regardless of the who , how and why .
__ro__ Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__ro__ Language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
__ro__ So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
__ro__ Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
__ro__ It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
__ro__ What is our intellect ?
__ro__ How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
__ro__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__ro__ How would you feel ?
__ro__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__ro__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__ro__ I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__ro__ I asked her once how things were going .
__ro__ She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; toqborni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; &quot; toqborni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
__ro__ He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
__ro__ Does she want to commit suicide ?
__ro__ &apos;Bury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
__ro__ It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
__ro__ She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
__ro__ Translate that for me .
__ro__ ( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
__ro__ We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
__ro__ Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
__ro__ Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
__ro__ The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
__ro__ We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
__ro__ And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
__ro__ We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
__ro__ In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
__ro__ So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
__ro__ Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
__ro__ After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
__ro__ You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
__ro__ Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
__ro__ We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
__ro__ If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
__ro__ We &apos;d have to find an existence .
__ro__ We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
__ro__ This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
__ro__ After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
__ro__ Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
__ro__ We are very cool !
__ro__ And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
__ro__ I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
__ro__ But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
__ro__ Creativity is the idea .
__ro__ So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
__ro__ At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
__ro__ Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
__ro__ Let &apos;s start from this moment .
__ro__ Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
__ro__ A single novel could make us global again .
__ro__ It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
__ro__ So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
__ro__ But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
__ro__ In conclusion , what can you do today ?
__ro__ Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
__ro__ Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
__ro__ But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
__ro__ ( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
__ro__ You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
__ro__ It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
__ro__ That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
__ro__ Second , there are many other things that we can do .
__ro__ We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
__ro__ We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
__ro__ Now I will tell you a secret .
__ro__ A baby first identifies its father through language .
__ro__ When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci , Maman , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe . ( Applause )
__ro__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__ro__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__ro__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__ro__ I want to know how I impact them .
__ro__ I want to know how they impact me .
__ro__ I want to know why they fish .
__ro__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__ro__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__ro__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__ro__ So what do we call this ?
__ro__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__ro__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
__ro__ Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
__ro__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__ro__ Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__ro__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__ro__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__ro__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__ro__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__ro__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__ro__ You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__ro__ Pole caught — no bycatch .
__ro__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
__ro__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__ro__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__ro__ Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
__ro__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__ro__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__ro__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__ro__ Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
__ro__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__ro__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__ro__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__ro__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__ro__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__ro__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__ro__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
__ro__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__ro__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__ro__ Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant .
__ro__ Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
__ro__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__ro__ Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__ro__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__ro__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__ro__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
__ro__ It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
__ro__ Whooo !
__ro__ This is an easy sell .
__ro__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__ro__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__ro__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__ro__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__ro__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__ro__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
__ro__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__ro__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__ro__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__ro__ So let &apos;s start there .
__ro__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__ro__ Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
__ro__ But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
__ro__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
__ro__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__ro__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__ro__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
__ro__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__ro__ Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__ro__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood .
__ro__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__ro__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__ro__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__ro__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__ro__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__ro__ A couple things happened .
__ro__ I made more money .
__ro__ People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
__ro__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__ro__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__ro__ They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
__ro__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__ro__ This is great .
__ro__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__ro__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
__ro__ Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
__ro__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__ro__ This is what we need to favor .
__ro__ This is what the green list says .
__ro__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__ro__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__ro__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__ro__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__ro__ Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
__ro__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__ro__ Put it on four plates .
__ro__ Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__ro__ Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__ro__ Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__ro__ I expect a lot from food .
__ro__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__ro__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
__ro__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__ro__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__ro__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__ro__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__ro__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__ro__ I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
__ro__ I get the meat sweats .
__ro__ It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
__ro__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__ro__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__ro__ Eat your vegetables .
__ro__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__ro__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__ro__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
__ro__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
__ro__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
__ro__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__ro__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__ro__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__ro__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__ro__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
__ro__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__ro__ We need to savor vegetables .
__ro__ We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
__ro__ And we need to save dinner .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ Hi . I am an architect .
__ro__ I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
__ro__ 1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
__ro__ It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
__ro__ Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
__ro__ This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
__ro__ There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
__ro__ As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
__ro__ In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
__ro__ Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
__ro__ I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
__ro__ So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
__ro__ My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
__ro__ My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
__ro__ After , the building was recycled .
__ro__ So that was the goal of my design .
__ro__ Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
__ro__ Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
__ro__ So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
__ro__ We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
__ro__ Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
__ro__ That was the problem .
__ro__ Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
__ro__ It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
__ro__ But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
__ro__ They have money and power .
__ro__ Those are invisible .
__ro__ So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
__ro__ That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
__ro__ So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
__ro__ But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
__ro__ For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
__ro__ That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
__ro__ Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
__ro__ So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
__ro__ We can make it better .
__ro__ So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
__ro__ 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
__ro__ Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
__ro__ Over two million people became refugees .
__ro__ But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
__ro__ They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
__ro__ But over two million people cut trees .
__ro__ It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
__ro__ That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
__ro__ Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
__ro__ So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
__ro__ We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
__ro__ And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
__ro__ Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
__ro__ And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
__ro__ So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
__ro__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
__ro__ After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
__ro__ I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
__ro__ They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
__ro__ So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
__ro__ I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
__ro__ I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
__ro__ The color coordination is very important .
__ro__ And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
__ro__ So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
__ro__ Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
__ro__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
__ro__ It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
__ro__ Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
__ro__ It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
__ro__ So this building became a permanent building .
__ro__ Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
__ro__ Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
__ro__ Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
__ro__ In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
__ro__ 2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
__ro__ In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
__ro__ And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
__ro__ I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
__ro__ I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
__ro__ In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
__ro__ It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
__ro__ In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
__ro__ And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
__ro__ And they are very kind , affording my model .
__ro__ I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
__ro__ So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
__ro__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
__ro__ Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
__ro__ Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
__ro__ This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
__ro__ After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
__ro__ But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
__ro__ People suffer mentally and physically .
__ro__ So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
__ro__ However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
__ro__ But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
__ro__ They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
__ro__ Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
__ro__ So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
__ro__ Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
__ro__ He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
__ro__ I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
__ro__ Many of the people want to stay here forever .
__ro__ I was very happy to hear that .
__ro__ Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
__ro__ About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
__ro__ And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
__ro__ So this is under construction .
__ro__ And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
__ro__ Thank you very much .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__ro__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__ro__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__ro__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
__ro__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__ro__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__ro__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__ro__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__ro__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__ro__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__ro__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__ro__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__ro__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
__ro__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__ro__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__ro__ What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
__ro__ Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__ro__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__ro__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__ro__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
__ro__ I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
__ro__ I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__ro__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__ro__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__ro__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__ro__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__ro__ On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__ro__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__ro__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__ro__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__ro__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__ro__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__ro__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__ro__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__ro__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__ro__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__ro__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
__ro__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__ro__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__ro__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__ro__ And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
__ro__ On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
__ro__ And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__ro__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__ro__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__ro__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__ro__ And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__ro__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__ro__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
__ro__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__ro__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__ro__ So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__ro__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__ro__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__ro__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__ro__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
__ro__ Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__ro__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
__ro__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__ro__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__ro__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__ro__ My son is 23 .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__ro__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__ro__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__ro__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__ro__ So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__ro__ You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
__ro__ And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__ro__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__ro__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__ro__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__ro__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__ro__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__ro__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__ro__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
__ro__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__ro__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__ro__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__ro__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__ro__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__ro__ And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__ro__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__ro__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__ro__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__ro__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__ro__ And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__ro__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__ro__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__ro__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__ro__ This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
__ro__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
__ro__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__ro__ Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__ro__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__ro__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
__ro__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__ro__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__ro__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
__ro__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__ro__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__ro__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__ro__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__ro__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__ro__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__ro__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__ro__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__ro__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__ro__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__ro__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__ro__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__ro__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__ro__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__ro__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__ro__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__ro__ Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
__ro__ What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
__ro__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__ro__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__ro__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__ro__ Same as the other side .
__ro__ Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__ro__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__ro__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__ro__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__ro__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__ro__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__ro__ Oh .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__ro__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__ro__ Not working either .
__ro__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__ro__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__ro__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__ro__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__ro__ So when you put four .
__ro__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__ro__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__ro__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__ro__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__ro__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__ro__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__ro__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__ro__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__ro__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__ro__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__ro__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__ro__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__ro__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__ro__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__ro__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__ro__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__ro__ So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
__ro__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__ro__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__ro__ So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
__ro__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__ro__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__ro__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__ro__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__ro__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__ro__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__ro__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
__ro__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__ro__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__ro__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__ro__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__ro__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__ro__ It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__ro__ We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
__ro__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__ro__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__ro__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__ro__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__ro__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__ro__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__ro__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__ro__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__ro__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__ro__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__ro__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__ro__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__ro__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__ro__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__ro__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__ro__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__ro__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__ro__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__ro__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__ro__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__ro__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__ro__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__ro__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__ro__ They work in the field .
__ro__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__ro__ They have education programs .
__ro__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__ro__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__ro__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__ro__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__ro__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__ro__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__ro__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__ro__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__ro__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__ro__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__ro__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__ro__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__ro__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__ro__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__ro__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__ro__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__ro__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__ro__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__ro__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__ro__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__ro__ This can happen .
__ro__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__ro__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__ro__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__ro__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__ro__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__ro__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__ro__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__ro__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__ro__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__ro__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__ro__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__ro__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__ro__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__ro__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__ro__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__ro__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__ro__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__ro__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__ro__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__ro__ This is the transformation that took place .
__ro__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__ro__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__ro__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__ro__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__ro__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__ro__ Thank you very much .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__ro__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__ro__ The rocket was huge .
__ro__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__ro__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__ro__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__ro__ In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__ro__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__ro__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__ro__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__ro__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__ro__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__ro__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__ro__ All hell broke loose .
__ro__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__ro__ It provoked the missile gap .
__ro__ It exploded an arms race .
__ro__ It began the space race .
__ro__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__ro__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__ro__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__ro__ Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__ro__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__ro__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__ro__ Support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
__ro__ And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__ro__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
__ro__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__ro__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
__ro__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__ro__ ( Applause ) .
__ro__ Thank you , Chris .
__ro__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__ro__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__ro__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__ro__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__ro__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__ro__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__ro__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__ro__ Let me show you what I mean .
__ro__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__ro__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__ro__ All right . Very significant mark .
__ro__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__ro__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__ro__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__ro__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__ro__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__ro__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__ro__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__ro__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__ro__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__ro__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__ro__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__ro__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__ro__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__ro__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__ro__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__ro__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__ro__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__ro__ Wake up .
__ro__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__ro__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__ro__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__ro__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__ro__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__ro__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__ro__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__ro__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__ro__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__ro__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__ro__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__ro__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__ro__ The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
__ro__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__ro__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__ro__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
__ro__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__ro__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
__ro__ And the third is a little bit less obvious .
__ro__ Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
__ro__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__ro__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__ro__ I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
__ro__ My brothers and I dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
__ro__ He was livid , and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
__ro__ Later , I understood why my father got so upset .
__ro__ Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
__ro__ My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
__ro__ His was a lonely struggle , because Bihar was also India &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
__ro__ And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
__ro__ And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was famished and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
__ro__ Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
__ro__ This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
__ro__ I resolved to give back .
__ro__ Later , I joined the World Bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
__ro__ My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
__ro__ But after we disbursed the loans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
__ro__ It was Bihar all over again .
__ro__ Bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
__ro__ Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
__ro__ And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
__ro__ Second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
__ro__ And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
__ro__ Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
__ro__ Open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__ro__ The first key shift is open knowledge .
__ro__ You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
__ro__ They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
__ro__ They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
__ro__ This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades today inspiring New York City .
__ro__ And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
__ro__ This is the second shift : open aid .
__ro__ Recently , the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
__ro__ Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
__ro__ Take GeoMapping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
__ro__ So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
__ro__ In this manner , the World Bank has now GeoMapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
__ro__ This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
__ro__ And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
__ro__ From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
__ro__ Are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
__ro__ So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
__ro__ But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
__ro__ This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
__ro__ To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
__ro__ In this map from Moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
__ro__ Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
__ro__ So in the Philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__ro__ And the government is responsive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action .
__ro__ And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
__ro__ In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
__ro__ This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
__ro__ And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
__ro__ Today , even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
__ro__ But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
__ro__ These are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
__ro__ So for instance , today , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
__ro__ These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar .
__ro__ Two years ago , on April 8th , 2010 , I called my father .
__ro__ It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
__ro__ Though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . He won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
__ro__ He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
__ro__ These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
__ro__ Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
__ro__ We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
__ro__ We need to accelerate these shifts .
__ro__ If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , in Uganda , and beyond .
__ro__ We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
__ro__ We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
__ro__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__ro__ Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
__ro__ That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
__ro__ 6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
__ro__ Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
__ro__ It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
__ro__ Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
__ro__ It stops babies from dying .
__ro__ Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
__ro__ It can save over 600,000 children every year .
__ro__ That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
__ro__ I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
__ro__ So now just take a minute .
__ro__ Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
__ro__ Please shake their hands .
__ro__ All right , get to know each other .
__ro__ They look really pretty .
__ro__ All right .
__ro__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__ro__ Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
__ro__ Well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
__ro__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__ro__ Actually , soap is available .
__ro__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__ro__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__ro__ Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__ro__ His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cupboard .
__ro__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__ro__ What &apos;s the result of that ?
__ro__ Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
__ro__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__ro__ Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
__ro__ Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
__ro__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__ro__ Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
__ro__ Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__ro__ And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
__ro__ A hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
__ro__ I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
__ro__ Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
__ro__ And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
__ro__ Win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
__ro__ Win for the private sector , because we build new generations of future handwashers .
__ro__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__ro__ Schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world &apos;s most important public health intervention .
__ro__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__ro__ I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
__ro__ We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
__ro__ My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
__ro__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__ro__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__ro__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__ro__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__ro__ This one is from Myanmar .
__ro__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__ro__ Her son , Myo , is her second one .
__ro__ And that &apos;s what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equip her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn .
__ro__ And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap .
__ro__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
__ro__ We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
__ro__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__ro__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__ro__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__ro__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__ro__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__ro__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__ro__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__ro__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__ro__ Thank you very much .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ But that can &apos;t be right .
__ro__ I am for chocolate donuts .
__ro__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__ro__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
__ro__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__ro__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__ro__ It &apos;s awful .
__ro__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__ro__ Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
__ro__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__ro__ So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
__ro__ A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__ro__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__ro__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__ro__ And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
__ro__ This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
__ro__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__ro__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__ro__ To give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
__ro__ That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
__ro__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__ro__ And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
__ro__ So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
__ro__ The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
__ro__ The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
__ro__ So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
__ro__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__ro__ One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
__ro__ And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
__ro__ So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
__ro__ So here &apos;s a video .
__ro__ You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
__ro__ But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
__ro__ That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
__ro__ The next work is Decoy .
__ro__ This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
__ro__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__ro__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__ro__ So here is the first test scenario .
__ro__ You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
__ro__ But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy .
__ro__ It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__ro__ Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
__ro__ And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
__ro__ The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
__ro__ In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
__ro__ So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
__ro__ Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
__ro__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__ro__ This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
__ro__ So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
__ro__ It could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
__ro__ It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
__ro__ So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
__ro__ So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
__ro__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
__ro__ It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
__ro__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__ro__ So here &apos;s a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
__ro__ And here is a prototype .
__ro__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
__ro__ Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
__ro__ It comes out of the idea of a window .
__ro__ This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
__ro__ So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
__ro__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__ro__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__ro__ Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
__ro__ So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
__ro__ So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they &apos;re oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
__ro__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__ro__ These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
__ro__ So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
__ro__ So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
__ro__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__ro__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__ro__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ And I would want to do that like that .
__ro__ That would be the plan .
__ro__ I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
__ro__ But then came my 90-page senior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
__ro__ It was way too big a project .
__ro__ So I planned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this .
__ro__ This is how the year would go .
__ro__ How hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
__ro__ No big deal , right ?
__ro__ But then , the funniest thing happened .
__ro__ And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
__ro__ And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
__ro__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__ro__ I write the blog Wait But Why .
__ro__ And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
__ro__ And to test this , I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator , so I could compare them .
__ro__ I actually brought them here to show you today .
__ro__ I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Now ...
__ro__ here &apos;s my brain .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) There is a difference .
__ro__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And to the Monkey , humans are just another animal species .
__ro__ You have to keep well-slept , well-fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
__ro__ I call it the Dark Playground .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes .
__ro__ It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
__ro__ Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
__ro__ As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
__ro__ And guess who woke up ?
__ro__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__ro__ This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
__ro__ When I did , I was amazed by the response .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And they were all writing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;
__ro__ But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails .
__ro__ These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
__ro__ And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the procrastinator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?
__ro__ And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
__ro__ It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cramming for some project .
__ro__ The frustration is not that they couldn &apos;t achieve their dreams ; it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t even able to start chasing them .
__ro__ So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany — that I don &apos;t think non-procrastinators exist .
__ro__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastinators .
__ro__ Now , I want to show you one last thing .
__ro__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__ro__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__ro__ We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey .
__ro__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) You know .
__ro__ Sometime soon .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
__ro__ I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ruth Tichauer , a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes .
__ro__ That is how I grew up : encouraged to see beyond any limitation .
__ro__ So part of my education included helping her in remote , indigenous communities .
__ro__ I cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
__ro__ During those trips , my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
__ro__ Go and look behind the Mountains .
__ro__ Something lost behind the mountains .
__ro__ Lost and waiting for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medical student .
__ro__ One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
__ro__ There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
__ro__ The problem starts during pregnancy .
__ro__ The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
__ro__ Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
__ro__ At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
__ro__ If it doesn &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
__ro__ It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
__ro__ As you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
__ro__ Video : ( Baby crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they seem desperate to breathe .
__ro__ To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
__ro__ One night , my friend Malte , were camping in the Amazon region .
__ro__ The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
__ro__ Then came a moment of inspiration .
__ro__ So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
__ro__ The holes in children &apos;s hearts can be closed with it .
__ro__ A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
__ro__ It maybe doesn &apos;t look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
__ro__ In this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
__ro__ The coil then closes the hole .
__ro__ After that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
__ro__ In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
__ro__ The coil , if it works , can save lives .
__ro__ I returned from Germany to Bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
__ro__ With my wife and partner , Dr. Alexandra Heath , we started to see patients .
__ro__ After successfully treating patients with our coil , we felt really enthusiastic .
__ro__ But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high .
__ro__ The hole in altitude patients is different , because the orifice between the arteries is larger .
__ro__ Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time , and they die .
__ro__ The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia .
__ro__ The search started again .
__ro__ We went back to the drawing board .
__ro__ After many trials , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
__ro__ For centuries , indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms , and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device .
__ro__ We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape .
__ro__ It seems this time , the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn &apos;t rust because it &apos;s made of only one piece .
__ro__ It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
__ro__ As you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
__ro__ Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
__ro__ Our device expands , places itself and closes the hole .
__ro__ We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
__ro__ No open surgery was necessary .
__ro__ ( Applause ) As doctors , we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal — if they do .
__ro__ This is the child from before , after the procedure .
__ro__ As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent healed .
__ro__ From start to finish , the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes .
__ro__ That &apos;s very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
__ro__ We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us .
__ro__ Together , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
__ro__ We lost the fear of creating something new .
__ro__ The path , it &apos;s not easy .
__ro__ Many obstacles arise all the time .
__ro__ But we receive strength from our patients .
__ro__ Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
__ro__ Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
__ro__ So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
__ro__ We are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
__ro__ This whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it , really : No child is left behind .
__ro__ Muchas gracias .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
__ro__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
__ro__ The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
__ro__ So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__ro__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__ro__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__ro__ Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
__ro__ Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
__ro__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
__ro__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__ro__ and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
__ro__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__ro__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__ro__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
__ro__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__ro__ So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
__ro__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__ro__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__ro__ So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
__ro__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__ro__ And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
__ro__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__ro__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__ro__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__ro__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
__ro__ DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
__ro__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__ro__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__ro__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__ro__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause . )
__ro__ Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
__ro__ I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
__ro__ There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
__ro__ The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
__ro__ So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
__ro__ Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
__ro__ It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
__ro__ And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
__ro__ In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
__ro__ In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
__ro__ In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
__ro__ After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
__ro__ You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
__ro__ So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
__ro__ And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
__ro__ So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
__ro__ At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
__ro__ And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
__ro__ Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
__ro__ We call this value-based healthcare .
__ro__ On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
__ro__ This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
__ro__ On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
__ro__ When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
__ro__ You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
__ro__ The differences were dramatic .
__ro__ Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
__ro__ Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
__ro__ If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
__ro__ You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
__ro__ If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
__ro__ Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
__ro__ That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
__ro__ When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
__ro__ But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
__ro__ And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
__ro__ Nobody knows .
__ro__ So going the hospital is a lottery .
__ro__ Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
__ro__ In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
__ro__ To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
__ro__ They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
__ro__ They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
__ro__ So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
__ro__ &quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
__ro__ And they finally agreed .
__ro__ And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
__ro__ Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
__ro__ They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
__ro__ Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
__ro__ Since then , they publish every year .
__ro__ Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
__ro__ And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
__ro__ For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
__ro__ Now I found this principle really exciting .
__ro__ So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
__ro__ Continuous improvement .
__ro__ Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
__ro__ That &apos;s exciting in itself .
__ro__ But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
__ro__ So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
__ro__ They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
__ro__ In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
__ro__ So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
__ro__ Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
__ro__ We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
__ro__ OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
__ro__ The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
__ro__ Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
__ro__ That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
__ro__ Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
__ro__ This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
__ro__ The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
__ro__ In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
__ro__ The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
__ro__ Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
__ro__ They were always best in class .
__ro__ We were always best in class .
__ro__ And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
__ro__ But most of them don &apos;t know .
__ro__ But physicians have another characteristic .
__ro__ They actually thrive from peer recognition .
__ro__ If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
__ro__ They will share the information on how to improve .
__ro__ So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
__ro__ Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
__ro__ This is happening in reality .
__ro__ We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
__ro__ Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
__ro__ You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
__ro__ It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
__ro__ We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
__ro__ They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
__ro__ The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
__ro__ That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
__ro__ Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
__ro__ In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
__ro__ Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
__ro__ Why is that ?
__ro__ Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
__ro__ They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
__ro__ This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
__ro__ The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
__ro__ Can we measure it better than we do ?
__ro__ We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
__ro__ And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
__ro__ There was an enormous energy in the room .
__ro__ There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
__ro__ At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
__ro__ He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ro__ Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
__ro__ I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
__ro__ We learned a lot from those failures .
__ro__ So I looked at these five .
__ro__ I used to think that the idea was everything .
__ro__ I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
__ro__ The customer is the true reality .
__ro__ Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding .
__ro__ We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the timing was probably maybe more important .
__ro__ Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
__ro__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__ro__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__ro__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__ro__ I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
__ro__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__ro__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__ro__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__ro__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__ro__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__ro__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__ro__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__ro__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__ro__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__ro__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__ro__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__ro__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__ro__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__ro__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__ro__ You see that glass of water ?
__ro__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__ro__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__ro__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__ro__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__ro__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__ro__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__ro__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__ro__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__ro__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__ro__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__ro__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__ro__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__ro__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__ro__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__ro__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__ro__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__ro__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__ro__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__ro__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__ro__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__ro__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__ro__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__ro__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__ro__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__ro__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__ro__ The light never goes out .
__ro__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__ro__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__ro__ Or is it photography ?
__ro__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__ro__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__ro__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__ro__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__ro__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__ro__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__ro__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__ro__ Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__ro__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__ro__ And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
__ro__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__ro__ When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
__ro__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__ro__ Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__ro__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__ro__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__ro__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__ro__ Is it something about the light ?
__ro__ What creates the illusion ?
__ro__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__ro__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__ro__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__ro__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__ro__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__ro__ And let me show you a simple example .
__ro__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__ro__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__ro__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__ro__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__ro__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__ro__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__ro__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__ro__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__ro__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__ro__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__ro__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__ro__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__ro__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__ro__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__ro__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__ro__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__ro__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__ro__ So here &apos;s another example .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__ro__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__ro__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__ro__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__ro__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__ro__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__ro__ The shores are from a different location .
__ro__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__ro__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__ro__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__ro__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__ro__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__ro__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__ro__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__ro__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ Why should we care about this ?
__ro__ It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
__ro__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__ro__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__ro__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__ro__ Can that possibly be true ?
__ro__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__ro__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__ro__ CA : How does it work ?
__ro__ How do people release the documents ?
__ro__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__ro__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__ro__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__ro__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__ro__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__ro__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__ro__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__ro__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__ro__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__ro__ If we can have this document up ...
__ro__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__ro__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__ro__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__ro__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__ro__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__ro__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__ro__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__ro__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__ro__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__ro__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__ro__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__ro__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__ro__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__ro__ And so it came in from the outside .
__ro__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__ro__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__ro__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__ro__ JA : Yep .
__ro__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__ro__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__ro__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__ro__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__ro__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__ro__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__ro__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__ro__ Light &apos; em all up .
__ro__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__ro__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__ro__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__ro__ we need to move , time now !
__ro__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__ro__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__ro__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__ro__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__ro__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__ro__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__ro__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__ro__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__ro__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__ro__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__ro__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__ro__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__ro__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__ro__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__ro__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__ro__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__ro__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__ro__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__ro__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__ro__ I mean , did he ?
__ro__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__ro__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__ro__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__ro__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__ro__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__ro__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__ro__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__ro__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__ro__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__ro__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__ro__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__ro__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__ro__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__ro__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__ro__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__ro__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__ro__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__ro__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__ro__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__ro__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__ro__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__ro__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__ro__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__ro__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__ro__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__ro__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__ro__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__ro__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__ro__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__ro__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__ro__ Light is good .
__ro__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__ro__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__ro__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__ro__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__ro__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__ro__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__ro__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__ro__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__ro__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__ro__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__ro__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__ro__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__ro__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__ro__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__ro__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__ro__ What is this ?
__ro__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__ro__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__ro__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__ro__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__ro__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__ro__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__ro__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__ro__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__ro__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__ro__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__ro__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__ro__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__ro__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__ro__ Yeah .
__ro__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__ro__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__ro__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__ro__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__ro__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__ro__ That &apos;s a problem .
__ro__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__ro__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__ro__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__ro__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__ro__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__ro__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__ro__ Can that be right ?
__ro__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__ro__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__ro__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__ro__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__ro__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__ro__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__ro__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__ro__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__ro__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__ro__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__ro__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__ro__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__ro__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__ro__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__ro__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__ro__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__ro__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__ro__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__ro__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__ro__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__ro__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__ro__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__ro__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__ro__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__ro__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__ro__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__ro__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__ro__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__ro__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__ro__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__ro__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__ro__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__ro__ CA : Wow .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__ro__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__ro__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__ro__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__ro__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__ro__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__ro__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__ro__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__ro__ Nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
__ro__ That &apos;s a sevenfold increase .
__ro__ This is not a rare thing , although it &apos;s against the law in most countries .
__ro__ There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century .
__ro__ There are 30 million people now living in slavery .
__ro__ In the United States right this moment , 60,000 people are living in human bondage , or slavery .
__ro__ It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
__ro__ Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world , and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere .
__ro__ The sex trade in Atlanta , Georgia , exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta , Georgia .
__ro__ In the United States , we take just the opposite position .
__ro__ That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
__ro__ In the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place .
__ro__ They &apos;re not prosecuted .
__ro__ Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
__ro__ These are the kind of things that go on .
__ro__ Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country .
__ro__ Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth .
__ro__ Sometimes , we &apos;ve had soldiers on the ground fighting .
__ro__ Other times , of course , now , we have drones that attack people and so forth .
__ro__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
__ro__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__ro__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__ro__ I will not dance to that beating .
__ro__ I know that beat .
__ro__ It is lifeless .
__ro__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__ro__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__ro__ I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
__ro__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__ro__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__ro__ I will not kill for you .
__ro__ Especially I will not die for you .
__ro__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__ro__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__ro__ Everyone can be wrong .
__ro__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__ro__ I will not forget where I come from .
__ro__ I will craft my own drum .
__ro__ Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
__ro__ Our humming will be drumming .
__ro__ I will not be played .
__ro__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__ro__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__ro__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__ro__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
__ro__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__ro__ ( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
__ro__ Confused , aspiring pacifists .
__ro__ I understand .
__ro__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__ro__ Like a lot .
__ro__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__ro__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
__ro__ What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__ro__ Poetry does that .
__ro__ It preps you . It aims you .
__ro__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__ro__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__ro__ Hold her now with you .
__ro__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__ro__ Are you holding her ?
__ro__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__ro__ Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
__ro__ But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__ro__ Whose son shall it be ?
__ro__ Which male child will perish a new day ?
__ro__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
__ro__ We cherish corpses .
__ro__ We mourn women , complicated .
__ro__ Bitches get beat daily .
__ro__ Profits made , prophets ignored .
__ro__ War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
__ro__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__ro__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__ro__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__ro__ Rhythm is half silence .
__ro__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__ro__ Sickness , health , tender violence .
__ro__ I think now I never was pure .
__ro__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am .
__ro__ Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
__ro__ I never was pure .
__ro__ Girl spoiled before ripened .
__ro__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__ro__ I experience exponentially .
__ro__ Everything is everything .
__ro__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__ro__ One woman loses six .
__ro__ One woman loses her head .
__ro__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__ro__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__ro__ One woman straps herself .
__ro__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__ro__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__ro__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__ro__ One woman never did .
__ro__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__ro__ Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__ro__ Faced with absence .
__ro__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
__ro__ My spine curves spiral .
__ro__ Precipice running to and running from human beings .
__ro__ Cluster bombs left behind .
__ro__ De facto landmines .
__ro__ A smoldering grief .
__ro__ Harvest contaminated tobacco .
__ro__ Harvest bombs .
__ro__ Harvest baby teeth .
__ro__ Harvest palms , smoke .
__ro__ Harvest witness , smoke .
__ro__ Resolutions , smoke .
__ro__ Salvation , smoke .
__ro__ Redemption , smoke .
__ro__ Breathe .
__ro__ Do not fear what has blown up .
__ro__ If you must , fear the unexploded .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__ro__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__ro__ Global famine was inevitable .
__ro__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
__ro__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__ro__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__ro__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__ro__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__ro__ Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__ro__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__ro__ Per-capita food production is up by a third .
__ro__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__ro__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__ro__ How did we achieve that ?
__ro__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
__ro__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__ro__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__ro__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__ro__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__ro__ These are both real objects .
__ro__ One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__ro__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__ro__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__ro__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__ro__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__ro__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__ro__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__ro__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__ro__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__ro__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__ro__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__ro__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__ro__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__ro__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__ro__ The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__ro__ And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__ro__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__ro__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__ro__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__ro__ They &apos;ve come together .
__ro__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__ro__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__ro__ In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__ro__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__ro__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
__ro__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__ro__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__ro__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__ro__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__ro__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__ro__ No other animal does it .
__ro__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__ro__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__ro__ You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
__ro__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__ro__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__ro__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__ro__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__ro__ Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__ro__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__ro__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__ro__ Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
__ro__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__ro__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__ro__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__ro__ So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
__ro__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__ro__ He can make his own spears and axes .
__ro__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__ro__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
__ro__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__ro__ And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__ro__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__ro__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__ro__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__ro__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__ro__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__ro__ You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
__ro__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__ro__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__ro__ And the answer is about half a second .
__ro__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__ro__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__ro__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__ro__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__ro__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__ro__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__ro__ It was self-sufficiency .
__ro__ We call that poverty these days .
__ro__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__ro__ How many other people ?
__ro__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__ro__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__ro__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__ro__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__ro__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__ro__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__ro__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__ro__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__ro__ Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
__ro__ They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
__ro__ He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__ro__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__ro__ They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
__ro__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__ro__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__ro__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__ro__ Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__ro__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__ro__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__ro__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__ro__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__ro__ The queen does it all .
__ro__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__ro__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__ro__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__ro__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__ro__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__ro__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__ro__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__ro__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__ro__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__ro__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__ro__ The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__ro__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
__ro__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__ro__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__ro__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__ro__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__ro__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__ro__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__ro__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__ro__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__ro__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__ro__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__ro__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
__ro__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__ro__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__ro__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__ro__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__ro__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__ro__ They &apos;re always made from local chert .
__ro__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
__ro__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__ro__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__ro__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__ro__ Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__ro__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__ro__ You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__ro__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__ro__ And that will have led to specialization .
__ro__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__ro__ Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
__ro__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__ro__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__ro__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__ro__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__ro__ An example is Tasmania .
__ro__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
__ro__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__ro__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
__ro__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__ro__ It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
__ro__ The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__ro__ The Tasmanians were isolated .
__ro__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__ro__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__ro__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__ro__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__ro__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__ro__ I mean this quite seriously .
__ro__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__ro__ He just knows how to run a company .
__ro__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__ro__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__ro__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__ro__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__ro__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__ro__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__ro__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__ro__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__ro__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
__ro__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__ro__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__ro__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__ro__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__ro__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__ro__ It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__ro__ However , bad things happen .
__ro__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__ro__ There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
__ro__ Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__ro__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__ro__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ Good afternoon .
__ro__ My name is Uldus .
__ro__ I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
__ro__ My name is Amit .
__ro__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__ro__ And it took 18 months .
__ro__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__ro__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__ro__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__ro__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__ro__ And I grew up in India .
__ro__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__ro__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__ro__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__ro__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__ro__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__ro__ You look around at all these museums here .
__ro__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__ro__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__ro__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__ro__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__ro__ You move around , you have fun .
__ro__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__ro__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__ro__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__ro__ Keep going . Have fun .
__ro__ Explore .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__ro__ I see this plus sign .
__ro__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__ro__ Now this is one of the images .
__ro__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__ro__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__ro__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__ro__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__ro__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__ro__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__ro__ You can zoom around very simply .
__ro__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__ro__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__ro__ But then you really want to go deep .
__ro__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__ro__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__ro__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__ro__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__ro__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__ro__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__ro__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__ro__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__ro__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__ro__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__ro__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__ro__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__ro__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__ro__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__ro__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__ro__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__ro__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__ro__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__ro__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__ro__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__ro__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__ro__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__ro__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__ro__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__ro__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__ro__ It really comes from these artists .
__ro__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__ro__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__ro__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__ro__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__ro__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__ro__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
__ro__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
__ro__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__ro__ I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
__ro__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__ro__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__ro__ Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual .
__ro__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
__ro__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
__ro__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
__ro__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__ro__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
__ro__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
__ro__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
__ro__ Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
__ro__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__ro__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
__ro__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__ro__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__ro__ It will dry up inside .
__ro__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__ro__ We all do .
__ro__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__ro__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__ro__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
__ro__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__ro__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__ro__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__ro__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__ro__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__ro__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__ro__ In my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__ro__ Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__ro__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__ro__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__ro__ My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__ro__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
__ro__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__ro__ I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__ro__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__ro__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__ro__ And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
__ro__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__ro__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__ro__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__ro__ My mother became a diplomat .
__ro__ So from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__ro__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreigner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__ro__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__ro__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__ro__ The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
__ro__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
__ro__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__ro__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__ro__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__ro__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
__ro__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__ro__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__ro__ In my mid-twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__ro__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__ro__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__ro__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__ro__ There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
__ro__ He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
__ro__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
__ro__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__ro__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__ro__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__ro__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__ro__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__ro__ I started writing fiction in English .
__ro__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__ro__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__ro__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__ro__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__ro__ When you &apos;re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__ro__ As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__ro__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__ro__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__ro__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__ro__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__ro__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__ro__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__ro__ I guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
__ro__ Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__ro__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__ro__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__ro__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__ro__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__ro__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__ro__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__ro__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__ro__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__ro__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__ro__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
__ro__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more heavily .
__ro__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__ro__ You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
__ro__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .
__ro__ Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__ro__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__ro__ The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__ro__ When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__ro__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
__ro__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__ro__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__ro__ It was only because of our passports .
__ro__ Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__ro__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__ro__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__ro__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__ro__ It comes from everywhere .
__ro__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
__ro__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__ro__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__ro__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict .
__ro__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__ro__ It was just a story .
__ro__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
__ro__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__ro__ Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__ro__ Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__ro__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
__ro__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__ro__ The other , in nuances .
__ro__ One draws boundaries .
__ro__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__ro__ Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
__ro__ Fiction is flowing water .
__ro__ In the Ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__ro__ With each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
__ro__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
__ro__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__ro__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__ro__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
__ro__ Literature has to take us beyond .
__ro__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__ro__ Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was — that I once was .
__ro__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
__ro__ When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__ro__ The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
__ro__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__ro__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__ro__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__ro__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__ro__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__ro__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__ro__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace , which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
__ro__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
__ro__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__ro__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__ro__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__ro__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
__ro__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__ro__ When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
__ro__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__ro__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__ro__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__ro__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__ro__ Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__ro__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__ro__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__ro__ Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__ro__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__ro__ We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
__ro__ In the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__ro__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__ro__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
__ro__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__ro__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
__ro__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__ro__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
__ro__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__ro__ Five million people use it every month .
__ro__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__ro__ His work is brilliant .
__ro__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__ro__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__ro__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
__ro__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__ro__ This is really exciting .
__ro__ According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__ro__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__ro__ We made this game in 2007 .
__ro__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__ro__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
__ro__ The &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
__ro__ It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Rockies .
__ro__ And the job in question was sheep rancher .
__ro__ My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
__ro__ I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
__ro__ And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
__ro__ The job in question : herding sheep . Great .
__ro__ We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
__ro__ So , normally , I never do any research at all .
__ro__ But , this is a touchy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
__ro__ So I called the Humane Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
__ro__ This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
__ro__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
__ro__ And then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
__ro__ Blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
__ro__ &quot; Great — got it . &quot;
__ro__ OK , I call the SPCA to confirm this — they confirm it .
__ro__ I also call PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confirm it .
__ro__ OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
__ro__ So the next day I go out .
__ro__ And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
__ro__ Melanie is the wife of Albert .
__ro__ Albert is the shepherd in question .
__ro__ Melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
__ro__ Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
__ro__ Alright . Great .
__ro__ Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
__ro__ I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
__ro__ Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
__ro__ Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
__ro__ And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
__ro__ And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
__ro__ In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
__ro__ A second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
__ro__ And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
__ro__ Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
__ro__ He snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what I hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
__ro__ Can we roll the video ?
__ro__ No I &apos;m kidding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
__ro__ So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
__ro__ I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
__ro__ There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scripting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
__ro__ We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse — we shoot what we get !
__ro__ I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
__ro__ We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Humane Society ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Humane Society .
__ro__ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb squeal and bleed — we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
__ro__ We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
__ro__ Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
__ro__ Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
__ro__ I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
__ro__ Gets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s quivering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
__ro__ And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
__ro__ When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
__ro__ Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
__ro__ He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
__ro__ And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
__ro__ And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German porno , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
__ro__ Albert hands me the knife .
__ro__ I go in , tail comes off .
__ro__ I go in , I grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
__ro__ Albert instructs , &quot; &quot; Push it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
__ro__ &quot; Push it further . &quot;
__ro__ I do .
__ro__ The testicles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; Bite &apos; em .
__ro__ Just bite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
__ro__ How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
__ro__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rockies , and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
__ro__ You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jacked-up metaphor ?
__ro__ I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
__ro__ I went in and I took them .
__ro__ I took them like this , and I yanked my face back .
__ro__ And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
__ro__ OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Poetics , &quot; &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
__ro__ And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__ro__ Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__ro__ Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
__ro__ Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
__ro__ It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; is .
__ro__ And I &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
__ro__ Great .
__ro__ The other word , peripeteia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know — Euripides and Sophocles — the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
__ro__ That &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
__ro__ And this metaphor in my head — I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
__ro__ When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
__ro__ I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
__ro__ Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peripetia .
__ro__ You know ?
__ro__ It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
__ro__ Neo in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
__ro__ &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
__ro__ These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
__ro__ And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK .
__ro__ Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
__ro__ Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
__ro__ And I talk to him .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
__ro__ Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
__ro__ You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
__ro__ You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
__ro__ I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
__ro__ &quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
__ro__ Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
__ro__ And , after that shoot , Dirty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
__ro__ And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
__ro__ I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
__ro__ People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
__ro__ As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
__ro__ And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
__ro__ I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
__ro__ Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God — I did it with them .
__ro__ They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
__ro__ And I see it over and over and over again .
__ro__ So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
__ro__ Follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
__ro__ Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
__ro__ Probably the worst advice I ever got .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
__ro__ I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
__ro__ I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
__ro__ I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
__ro__ Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
__ro__ He &apos;s making a great living .
__ro__ You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
__ro__ The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
__ro__ He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
__ro__ He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
__ro__ And I hear that story over and over .
__ro__ Matt Froind , a dairy farmer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
__ro__ Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
__ro__ Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
__ro__ So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
__ro__ I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call &quot; &quot; successories &quot; &quot; that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now .
__ro__ That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
__ro__ Safety — safety first ?
__ro__ Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
__ro__ I mean — this is heresy , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
__ro__ Right ?
__ro__ ( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
__ro__ What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
__ro__ They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
__ro__ And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; &quot; Deadliest Catch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
__ro__ We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
__ro__ Most hazardous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
__ro__ So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
__ro__ Unspeakably dangerous .
__ro__ I scamper down , I go into the wheelhouse and I say , with some level of incredulity , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
__ro__ And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
__ro__ It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
__ro__ But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
__ro__ My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
__ro__ My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
__ro__ And for the rest of that day , safety first .
__ro__ I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
__ro__ Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
__ro__ I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
__ro__ But , what it all comes down to is this .
__ro__ I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
__ro__ It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
__ro__ It &apos;s a civil war .
__ro__ It &apos;s a cold war , really .
__ro__ We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
__ro__ And we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
__ro__ The way we portray working people on TV — it &apos;s laughable .
__ro__ If there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Admit it .
__ro__ You see him all the time .
__ro__ That &apos;s what plumbers look like , right ?
__ro__ We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
__ro__ That &apos;s what TV does .
__ro__ We try hard on &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
__ro__ But , we &apos;ve waged this war on Madison Avenue .
__ro__ I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
__ro__ Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
__ro__ Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
__ro__ I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
__ro__ And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
__ro__ How many people have their Blackberries ?
__ro__ We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
__ro__ I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
__ro__ Good grief , not to this crowd .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
__ro__ And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
__ro__ Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
__ro__ All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
__ro__ So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
__ro__ Our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
__ro__ They look like the stuff we walk around with .
__ro__ And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
__ro__ And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
__ro__ And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
__ro__ I got a lot wrong .
__ro__ So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
__ro__ Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
__ro__ I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
__ro__ Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
__ro__ The infrastructure is a huge deal .
__ro__ This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
__ro__ The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
__ro__ Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
__ro__ The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
__ro__ Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
__ro__ So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
__ro__ And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
__ro__ They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
__ro__ It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__ro__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
__ro__ of sleep-deprived women .
__ro__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__ro__ Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
__ro__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__ro__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__ro__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__ro__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__ro__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
__ro__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__ro__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__ro__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__ro__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__ro__ So a high I.Q.
__ro__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__ro__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__ro__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__ro__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__ro__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__ro__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ How does this happen ?
__ro__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__ro__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__ro__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__ro__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__ro__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__ro__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__ro__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__ro__ Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there .
__ro__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__ro__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__ro__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__ro__ I talked about that earlier .
__ro__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__ro__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
__ro__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__ro__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__ro__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
__ro__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__ro__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__ro__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__ro__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
__ro__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__ro__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__ro__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__ro__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__ro__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__ro__ It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
__ro__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__ro__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__ro__ Patients become depressed .
__ro__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__ro__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__ro__ Why does this happen ?
__ro__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
__ro__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__ro__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__ro__ He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
__ro__ He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
__ro__ He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__ro__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__ro__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;
__ro__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__ro__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__ro__ This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
__ro__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__ro__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__ro__ Why would that be ?
__ro__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__ro__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
__ro__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__ro__ That gives you the clue .
__ro__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
__ro__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
__ro__ So far , so good .
__ro__ OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
__ro__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__ro__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__ro__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__ro__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__ro__ Ninety-nine percent of you .
__ro__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__ro__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__ro__ ( Laughter )
__ro__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__ro__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
__ro__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
__ro__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__ro__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__ro__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__ro__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__ro__ Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
__ro__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__ro__ I had to do something .
__ro__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__ro__ So I tried bronze casting .
__ro__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__ro__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__ro__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
__ro__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__ro__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
__ro__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__ro__ I was mesmerized .
__ro__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
__ro__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__ro__ Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
__ro__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
__ro__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__ro__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__ro__ Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__ro__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
__ro__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__ro__ So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
__ro__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__ro__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__ro__ I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
__ro__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__ro__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__ro__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
__ro__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
__ro__ So we had to create one .
__ro__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
__ro__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__ro__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
__ro__ Now it had a sense of place .
__ro__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__ro__ As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__ro__ My life was not going to be the same .
__ro__ I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__ro__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__ro__ Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
__ro__ So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__ro__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__ro__ Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__ro__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__ro__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__ro__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
__ro__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__ro__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
__ro__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__ro__ Its shape was too complex now .
__ro__ So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__ro__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__ro__ There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__ro__ So we had to create it .
__ro__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__ro__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__ro__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__ro__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__ro__ Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
__ro__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__ro__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__ro__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__ro__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__ro__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
__ro__ Thank you .
__ro__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__ro__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__ro__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__ro__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__ro__ ( Applause )
__ro__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__ro__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__ro__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__ro__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__ro__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__ro__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__ro__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__ro__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__ro__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__ro__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__ro__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__ro__ And I felt lighter in my body .
__fr__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__fr__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__fr__ While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__fr__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__fr__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__fr__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__fr__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__fr__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__fr__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__fr__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__fr__ There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
__fr__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__fr__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__fr__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__fr__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__fr__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__fr__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__fr__ One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
__fr__ ( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
__fr__ Death : Adam ?
__fr__ AO : Yeah .
__fr__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
__fr__ AO : Who is this ?
__fr__ Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
__fr__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__fr__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
__fr__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__fr__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__fr__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__fr__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__fr__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__fr__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__fr__ One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__fr__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
__fr__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__fr__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__fr__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__fr__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__fr__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__fr__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__fr__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__fr__ Thank you very much .

__fr__ ( Guitar ) ( Singing ) Rollercoaster , carousel .
__fr__ Where the highs are heaven , but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
__fr__ You can grab the ring , you can ring that bell , when the ride is over , you can never tell .
__fr__ People tell you this one thing — will make your life complete .
__fr__ So you , you give it everything you got and you wind up on the street .
__fr__ Then one day you wake up , and they tell you &quot; &quot; you &apos;re a queen , &quot; &quot; but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings .
__fr__ Rollercoaster , carousel .
__fr__ Where the highs are heaven , but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
__fr__ You can grab the ring , you can ring that bell , when the ride is over , you can never tell .
__fr__ But lose your edge or lose your cool , they will drop you like a dime .
__fr__ Everyone is crowding &apos; round when fortune is your friend .
__fr__ When your luck is running out , you &apos;re all alone again .
__fr__ Rollercoaster , carousel .
__fr__ Where the highs are heaven but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
__fr__ You can grab the ring , you can ring that bell , when the ride is over you can never tell .
__fr__ Well , maybe I &apos;m just cynical , and all these words are lies , but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise .
__fr__ But caution makes you hesitate , and hesitate you &apos;re lost , so take your opportunities and never count the cost .
__fr__ Rollercoaster , carousel .
__fr__ Where the highs are heaven , but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
__fr__ You can grab the ring , you can ring that bell , when the ride is over — over , over , you can never , ever tell .

__fr__ Carousel , carousel , carousel , carousel .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Michael Pemberton . ( Applause )
__fr__ Thank you so much .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ This disconnect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
__fr__ Now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
__fr__ This is Sami Kafala .
__fr__ And this is Tracy Shapiro , who took a 13-year career break .
__fr__ The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house .
__fr__ This is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan .
__fr__ There &apos;s one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break .
__fr__ I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3 .
__fr__ Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
__fr__ Now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
__fr__ Think about how far we have come .
__fr__ So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__fr__ ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
__fr__ It might take a moment to load .
__fr__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
__fr__ But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it .
__fr__ There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
__fr__ So we set out to build our case .
__fr__ This is Kathleen Maxian .
__fr__ The test was negative .
__fr__ Sort of .
__fr__ Ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
__fr__ We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
__fr__ I was clearly more nervous than he was .
__fr__ The argument itself was riveting .
__fr__ Chris argued brilliantly .
__fr__ Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
__fr__ But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
__fr__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__fr__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__fr__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__fr__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__fr__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__fr__ Where are economic networks ?
__fr__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__fr__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__fr__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__fr__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
__fr__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__fr__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
__fr__ We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
__fr__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__fr__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__fr__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__fr__ And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
__fr__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__fr__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__fr__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__fr__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__fr__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
__fr__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__fr__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__fr__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__fr__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__fr__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
__fr__ The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__fr__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__fr__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__fr__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__fr__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__fr__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__fr__ And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
__fr__ So this is how it works .
__fr__ This is a video prototype .
__fr__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__fr__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__fr__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
__fr__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__fr__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__fr__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__fr__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__fr__ So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__fr__ So this is a very early prototype .
__fr__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__fr__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
__fr__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__fr__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__fr__ So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__fr__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__fr__ On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__fr__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__fr__ Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__fr__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__fr__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__fr__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__fr__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__fr__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__fr__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__fr__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__fr__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
__fr__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
__fr__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__fr__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__fr__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__fr__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__fr__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__fr__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__fr__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__fr__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__fr__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__fr__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__fr__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__fr__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__fr__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__fr__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__fr__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__fr__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
__fr__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__fr__ So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__fr__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__fr__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__fr__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__fr__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
__fr__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__fr__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__fr__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ OK , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
__fr__ And specifically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love .
__fr__ Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this metaphor , falling , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
__fr__ And I picture it this way because falling is not jumping .
__fr__ Falling is accidental , it &apos;s uncontrollable .
__fr__ It &apos;s something that happens to us without our consent .
__fr__ And this — this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship .
__fr__ I am a writer and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which means I think about words for a living .
__fr__ You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters , and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem .
__fr__ So , in love , we fall .
__fr__ We &apos;re struck .
__fr__ We are crushed .
__fr__ We swoon .
__fr__ We burn with passion .
__fr__ Love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
__fr__ Our hearts ache , and then they break .
__fr__ So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) They do .
__fr__ And they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances .
__fr__ My favorite one of these is &quot; &quot; smitten , &quot; &quot; which is the past participle of the word &quot; &quot; smite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dictionary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defined as both &quot; &quot; grievous affliction , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I tend to associate the word &quot; &quot; smite &quot; &quot; with a very particular context , which is the Old Testament .
__fr__ In the Book of Exodus alone , there are 16 references to smiting , which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts . ( Laughter )
__fr__ Right ?
__fr__ So , how did this happen ?
__fr__ How have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering ?
__fr__ And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims ?
__fr__ These are difficult questions , but I have some theories .
__fr__ And to think this through , I want to focus on one metaphor in particular , which is the idea of love as madness .
__fr__ When I first started researching romantic love , I found these madness metaphors everywhere .
__fr__ These are just a few examples .
__fr__ &quot; Got me looking , got me looking so crazy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great philosopher , Beyoncé Knowles . ( Laughter )
__fr__ I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
__fr__ And it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows .
__fr__ I can remember one moment in particular .
__fr__ And it was late , it was nearly midnight , we &apos;d gotten into an argument over dinner , and when we got back to our room , he threw his things in the bag and stormed out .
__fr__ While I can no longer remember what that argument was about , I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave .
__fr__ I was 22 , it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
__fr__ I had another week until my flight home , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around .
__fr__ I had no guidebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
__fr__ Someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just froze .
__fr__ I just sat there .
__fr__ And then I burst into tears .
__fr__ But despite my panic , some small voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
__fr__ I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love .
__fr__ And it sounds so strange to me now , but at 22 , I longed to have dramatic experiences , and in that moment , I was irrational and furious and devastated , and weirdly enough , I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me .
__fr__ I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how loved worked .
__fr__ This really should not be surprising , considering that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two albums and one novel with the title &quot; &quot; Crazy Love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he came back to our room .
__fr__ This must be a real romance . &quot; &quot; I expected my first love to feel like madness , and of course , it met that expectation very well .
__fr__ But loving someone like that — as if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
__fr__ But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
__fr__ Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love .
__fr__ In fact , there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal , because , neurochemically speaking , romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished .
__fr__ This is true .
__fr__ This study from 1999 used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder .
__fr__ So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors .
__fr__ And there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way .
__fr__ Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
__fr__ And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
__fr__ But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usually from a few months to a couple of years .
__fr__ When I got back from my trip to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , checking my email , desperate to hear from the guy I loved .
__fr__ I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction , then I did not need their friendship .
__fr__ So I stopped hanging out with most of them .
__fr__ And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life .
__fr__ But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable , because if I could be miserable , then I would prove how much I loved him .
__fr__ And if I could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
__fr__ Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
__fr__ Our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a breakup , that neurochemical reward is withdrawn .
__fr__ And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neurochemically speaking , going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal , which I find reassuring .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love .
__fr__ In this case , we &apos;re talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness .
__fr__ It &apos;s kind of an interesting feedback loop .
__fr__ Love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
__fr__ What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy .
__fr__ That sounds terrible .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) To reconcile this , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
__fr__ So , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
__fr__ If we were more assertive , more open-minded , more generous and instead of falling in love , we stepped into love .
__fr__ I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
__fr__ They argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a guide for future actions , like self-fulfilling prophecies .
__fr__ Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collaborative work of art .
__fr__ I really like this way of thinking about love .
__fr__ Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments , which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of , or ideas contained within , a given metaphor .
__fr__ So if love is a collaborative work of art , then love is an aesthetic experience .
__fr__ Love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustrating and emotionally demanding .
__fr__ And love involves both joy and pain .
__fr__ Ultimately , each experience of love is different .
__fr__ When I was younger , it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accept whatever love offered .
__fr__ When 14-year-old Juliet first meets — or , when 14-year-old Juliet cannot be with Romeo , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disappointed or angsty .
__fr__ Where is she ?
__fr__ She wants to die .
__fr__ Right ?
__fr__ And just as a refresher , at this point in the play , act three of five , Romeo is not dead .
__fr__ He &apos;s alive , he &apos;s healthy , he &apos;s just been banished from the city .
__fr__ I understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Juliet &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
__fr__ Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent , is empowering .
__fr__ It &apos;s still hard .
__fr__ Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together .
__fr__ This isn &apos;t easy , either .
__fr__ But it &apos;s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like madness .
__fr__ This version of love is not about winning or losing someone &apos;s affection .
__fr__ Instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
__fr__ This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
__fr__ This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good collaborators . Maybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;
__fr__ Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shorter than I had planned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself .
__fr__ This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m really glad to be here .
__fr__ I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
__fr__ And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
__fr__ Or here .
__fr__ On one side , all life on Earth needs energy .
__fr__ And this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a succulent tomato .
__fr__ This is what life needs to survive , all life .
__fr__ So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
__fr__ You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid .
__fr__ It &apos;s a Goldilocks-type problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it .
__fr__ Number one : if Mama Bear &apos;s bowl is too cold when Goldilocks walks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too cold ?
__fr__ Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
__fr__ And the same is true with planets .
__fr__ They vary . They evolve .
__fr__ And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
__fr__ Earth has one ; Venus and Mars do not .
__fr__ I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets .
__fr__ But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
__fr__ We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth .
__fr__ You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet .
__fr__ This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habitable , although very soon we may come to know of more .
__fr__ I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
__fr__ Thanks .
__fr__ I love the Internet .
__fr__ It &apos;s true .
__fr__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__fr__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__fr__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__fr__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__fr__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__fr__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__fr__ So let me show you something .
__fr__ This here is Brain .
__fr__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__fr__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__fr__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__fr__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__fr__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__fr__ All right .
__fr__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__fr__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__fr__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__fr__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__fr__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__fr__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__fr__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__fr__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__fr__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__fr__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__fr__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
__fr__ And I knocked on the door .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__fr__ Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Basit .
__fr__ Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
__fr__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__fr__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__fr__ I asked them why .
__fr__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__fr__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__fr__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__fr__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__fr__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__fr__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__fr__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__fr__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__fr__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__fr__ For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
__fr__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__fr__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__fr__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__fr__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__fr__ ( Siren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__fr__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__fr__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__fr__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__fr__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__fr__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__fr__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__fr__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__fr__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
__fr__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__fr__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__fr__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__fr__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__fr__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__fr__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__fr__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
__fr__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__fr__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__fr__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__fr__ So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
__fr__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
__fr__ Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__fr__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__fr__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__fr__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__fr__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__fr__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__fr__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__fr__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__fr__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__fr__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__fr__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__fr__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__fr__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
__fr__ We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
__fr__ These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
__fr__ They are both right now on the run .
__fr__ Nobody knows where they are .
__fr__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__fr__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__fr__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__fr__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
__fr__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
__fr__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__fr__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__fr__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__fr__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__fr__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__fr__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__fr__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__fr__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__fr__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__fr__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__fr__ How do you actually track them down ?
__fr__ Let me give you an example .
__fr__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__fr__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__fr__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__fr__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__fr__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
__fr__ It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
__fr__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__fr__ And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
__fr__ Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
__fr__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__fr__ But just keep staring at it .
__fr__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__fr__ And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
__fr__ But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
__fr__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__fr__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__fr__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__fr__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__fr__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__fr__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__fr__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
__fr__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
__fr__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__fr__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__fr__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__fr__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__fr__ And he drives a very nice car .
__fr__ In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__fr__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
__fr__ How do I know about this car ?
__fr__ Because he blogged about the car .
__fr__ He actually had a car accident .
__fr__ In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__fr__ And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
__fr__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
__fr__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
__fr__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__fr__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__fr__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__fr__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__fr__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__fr__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__fr__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__fr__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__fr__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__fr__ That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__fr__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__fr__ This is what runs everything around us .
__fr__ PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__fr__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__fr__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__fr__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__fr__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__fr__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__fr__ Everything is being run by computers .
__fr__ Everything is reliant on these computers working .
__fr__ We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__fr__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__fr__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__fr__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__fr__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__fr__ Think about all the services we have online .
__fr__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__fr__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__fr__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__fr__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__fr__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__fr__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__fr__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
__fr__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__fr__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__fr__ Thank you very much .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__fr__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__fr__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__fr__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__fr__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__fr__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__fr__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__fr__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__fr__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__fr__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__fr__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__fr__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__fr__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__fr__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__fr__ This is an illusion .
__fr__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__fr__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__fr__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__fr__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__fr__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__fr__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__fr__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__fr__ We can &apos;t .
__fr__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__fr__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__fr__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__fr__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__fr__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__fr__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__fr__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__fr__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__fr__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__fr__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__fr__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__fr__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__fr__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__fr__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__fr__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__fr__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__fr__ And what does it mean ?
__fr__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__fr__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__fr__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__fr__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__fr__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__fr__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__fr__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__fr__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__fr__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__fr__ One country , two systems .
__fr__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__fr__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__fr__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__fr__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__fr__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__fr__ What happened ?
__fr__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__fr__ One nation , one system .
__fr__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__fr__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__fr__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__fr__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__fr__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__fr__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__fr__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__fr__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__fr__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__fr__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__fr__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__fr__ So the question is , why ?
__fr__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__fr__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__fr__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__fr__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__fr__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__fr__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__fr__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__fr__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__fr__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__fr__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__fr__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__fr__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__fr__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__fr__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__fr__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__fr__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__fr__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__fr__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__fr__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__fr__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__fr__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__fr__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__fr__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__fr__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__fr__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__fr__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__fr__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__fr__ The state is everywhere in China .
__fr__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__fr__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__fr__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__fr__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__fr__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__fr__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__fr__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__fr__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__fr__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__fr__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__fr__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__fr__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__fr__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__fr__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__fr__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__fr__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__fr__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__fr__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__fr__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__fr__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__fr__ But it &apos;s not .
__fr__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__fr__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__fr__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__fr__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__fr__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__fr__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__fr__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__fr__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__fr__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__fr__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__fr__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__fr__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__fr__ And there are two consequences of this .
__fr__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__fr__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__fr__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__fr__ When did that last happen ?
__fr__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__fr__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__fr__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__fr__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__fr__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__fr__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__fr__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__fr__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__fr__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__fr__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__fr__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__fr__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__fr__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__fr__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__fr__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__fr__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__fr__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__fr__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__fr__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__fr__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__fr__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__fr__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__fr__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__fr__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__fr__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__fr__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__fr__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__fr__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__fr__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__fr__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__fr__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__fr__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__fr__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__fr__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__fr__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__fr__ By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__fr__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__fr__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__fr__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__fr__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__fr__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__fr__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__fr__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__fr__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__fr__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__fr__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__fr__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__fr__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__fr__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__fr__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__fr__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__fr__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__fr__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__fr__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__fr__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__fr__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__fr__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__fr__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__fr__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__fr__ Last .
__fr__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
__fr__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__fr__ And these are facts , guys .
__fr__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
__fr__ It &apos;s not .
__fr__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__fr__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__fr__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__fr__ We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__fr__ How did this happen ?
__fr__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__fr__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
__fr__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__fr__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__fr__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__fr__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__fr__ We don &apos;t value play .
__fr__ In fact , we devalue play .
__fr__ And we devalue it in three areas .
__fr__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__fr__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__fr__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__fr__ And instead , what do we value ?
__fr__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__fr__ To be serious .
__fr__ To be really , really serious .
__fr__ It did .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__fr__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__fr__ Heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
__fr__ I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__fr__ We have a serious meme running through .
__fr__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__fr__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__fr__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__fr__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . Iskam baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woohoo !
__fr__ But then what happens in step three ?
__fr__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
__fr__ But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__fr__ So what happens ?
__fr__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__fr__ What happens then ?
__fr__ It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__fr__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__fr__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__fr__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__fr__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__fr__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
__fr__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__fr__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__fr__ We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
__fr__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__fr__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__fr__ What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
__fr__ Autocratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__fr__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__fr__ Untrusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__fr__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.M.
__fr__ That &apos;s somehow unprofessional and bad .
__fr__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s unfulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__fr__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__fr__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__fr__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__fr__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__fr__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__fr__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__fr__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__fr__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__fr__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__fr__ And you know what ?
__fr__ Evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that aren &apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__fr__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__fr__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . Ants play .
__fr__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__fr__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__fr__ Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__fr__ Kittens play . We all know kittens play .
__fr__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__fr__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__fr__ Bears play .
__fr__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__fr__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__fr__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__fr__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__fr__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__fr__ Dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__fr__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__fr__ Yours truly : humans .
__fr__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__fr__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__fr__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__fr__ Really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__fr__ And who are the biggest neotenists ?
__fr__ Humans . We play sports .
__fr__ We do it for fun , or as Olympians , or as professionals .
__fr__ We play musical instruments .
__fr__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
__fr__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__fr__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__fr__ It is a huge benefit .
__fr__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__fr__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__fr__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__fr__ As a result , what happens ?
__fr__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__fr__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__fr__ These guys are facts .
__fr__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__fr__ These are the benefits to play .
__fr__ It is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__fr__ And if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
__fr__ We hold ourselves back .
__fr__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__fr__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__fr__ What does this world look like ?
__fr__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__fr__ It &apos;s pretty glum .
__fr__ Now imagine your workplace .
__fr__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__fr__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__fr__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__fr__ Or is it crap ? Is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
__fr__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__fr__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__fr__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__fr__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__fr__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__fr__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__fr__ In fact , play improves our work .
__fr__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__fr__ For example , it stimulates creativity .
__fr__ It increases our openness to change .
__fr__ It improves our ability to learn .
__fr__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__fr__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__fr__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__fr__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
__fr__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__fr__ Our thinking is backwards .
__fr__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__fr__ We should be celebrating play .
__fr__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__fr__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__fr__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__fr__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__fr__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__fr__ And what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
__fr__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__fr__ People , service , profit .
__fr__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__fr__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__fr__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__fr__ One , play is universal .
__fr__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__fr__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sciant .
__fr__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__fr__ Not one customer would refer us .
__fr__ I asked them all .
__fr__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__fr__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__fr__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
__fr__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__fr__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__fr__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__fr__ Basically promoting fun .
__fr__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__fr__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
__fr__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__fr__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__fr__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__fr__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__fr__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__fr__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__fr__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__fr__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__fr__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__fr__ Rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__fr__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__fr__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__fr__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__fr__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__fr__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__fr__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__fr__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__fr__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__fr__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__fr__ Let them be on the Internet .
__fr__ Let them be on instant messengers .
__fr__ Let them take long lunches .
__fr__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__fr__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__fr__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__fr__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__fr__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__fr__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__fr__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__fr__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__fr__ of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__fr__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__fr__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__fr__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__fr__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__fr__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__fr__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__fr__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__fr__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__fr__ So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__fr__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__fr__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__fr__ And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
__fr__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__fr__ We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__fr__ So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
__fr__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__fr__ I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
__fr__ And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__fr__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__fr__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__fr__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__fr__ We make ourselves small .
__fr__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__fr__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__fr__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__fr__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__fr__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__fr__ Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__fr__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__fr__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__fr__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__fr__ So it goes both ways .
__fr__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__fr__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__fr__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__fr__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
__fr__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__fr__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__fr__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__fr__ So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__fr__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__fr__ Here are a couple more .
__fr__ And here are the low-power poses .
__fr__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__fr__ So this is what happens .
__fr__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__fr__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__fr__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__fr__ Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
__fr__ So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__fr__ And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
__fr__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__fr__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__fr__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__fr__ Imagine this is the person interviewing you .
__fr__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
__fr__ People hate this .
__fr__ We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
__fr__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__fr__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__fr__ These kinds of things .
__fr__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
__fr__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__fr__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__fr__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__fr__ I was thrown from the car .
__fr__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__fr__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__fr__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__fr__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__fr__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__fr__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__fr__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__fr__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__fr__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__fr__ Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
__fr__ So , this is two minutes .
__fr__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__fr__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__fr__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
__fr__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__fr__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__fr__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__fr__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__fr__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__fr__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__fr__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__fr__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__fr__ This is a time of need .
__fr__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__fr__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__fr__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__fr__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__fr__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__fr__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__fr__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__fr__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__fr__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__fr__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__fr__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__fr__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__fr__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__fr__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__fr__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__fr__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__fr__ The earth moved for both of them .
__fr__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__fr__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__fr__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__fr__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__fr__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__fr__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__fr__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__fr__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
__fr__ All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
__fr__ So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
__fr__ Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
__fr__ BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
__fr__ BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
__fr__ Audience : What are you reading ?
__fr__ BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
__fr__ I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
__fr__ It literally says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
__fr__ That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
__fr__ It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
__fr__ Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
__fr__ All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ow ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
__fr__ But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
__fr__ And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
__fr__ Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
__fr__ But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
__fr__ Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
__fr__ They begin with a question .
__fr__ The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
__fr__ Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
__fr__ Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
__fr__ Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
__fr__ Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
__fr__ The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
__fr__ And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
__fr__ So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
__fr__ And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
__fr__ They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
__fr__ It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
__fr__ So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
__fr__ It &apos;s play .
__fr__ Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
__fr__ Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
__fr__ Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
__fr__ Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
__fr__ Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
__fr__ It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
__fr__ So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
__fr__ That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
__fr__ So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
__fr__ And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
__fr__ Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
__fr__ The first step was to ask a question .
__fr__ Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
__fr__ So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
__fr__ So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
__fr__ So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
__fr__ Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
__fr__ She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
__fr__ Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
__fr__ Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
__fr__ So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
__fr__ Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
__fr__ But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
__fr__ So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
__fr__ Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
__fr__ Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
__fr__ But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
__fr__ AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
__fr__ We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
__fr__ They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
__fr__ Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
__fr__ What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
__fr__ It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
__fr__ It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
__fr__ So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
__fr__ ( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5C .
__fr__ Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
__fr__ Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
__fr__ BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
__fr__ Student : There &apos;s two up there .
__fr__ And three in here .
__fr__ BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
__fr__ They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
__fr__ And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
__fr__ So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
__fr__ So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
__fr__ The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
__fr__ Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
__fr__ And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
__fr__ That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
__fr__ It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
__fr__ So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
__fr__ All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
__fr__ The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
__fr__ Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
__fr__ The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
__fr__ They say no .
__fr__ So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
__fr__ And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
__fr__ What was the feedback like ?
__fr__ Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
__fr__ It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
__fr__ It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
__fr__ It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
__fr__ Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
__fr__ And I &apos;ll just read one .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
__fr__ What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
__fr__ Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
__fr__ Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
__fr__ Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
__fr__ Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
__fr__ Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
__fr__ Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
__fr__ BL : This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
__fr__ Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
__fr__ You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
__fr__ ( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
__fr__ Audience : ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
__fr__ Everyone over there shout . ( Shouts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
__fr__ Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
__fr__ That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
__fr__ Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
__fr__ So , Amy ?
__fr__ AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
__fr__ Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
__fr__ But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
__fr__ You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
__fr__ Thank you.BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__fr__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__fr__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__fr__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__fr__ So get out your pen and paper .
__fr__ Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__fr__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__fr__ There are 800 million people starving .
__fr__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__fr__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__fr__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__fr__ The lists go on and on .
__fr__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__fr__ There are many , many problems out there .
__fr__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__fr__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__fr__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__fr__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__fr__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__fr__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__fr__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__fr__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__fr__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__fr__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__fr__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__fr__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__fr__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__fr__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__fr__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__fr__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__fr__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__fr__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__fr__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__fr__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__fr__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__fr__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__fr__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__fr__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__fr__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__fr__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__fr__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__fr__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__fr__ And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__fr__ Nobody wants to do this .
__fr__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__fr__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__fr__ And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__fr__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__fr__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
__fr__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__fr__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__fr__ We have not had an idea .
__fr__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__fr__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__fr__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__fr__ It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
__fr__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__fr__ And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__fr__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
__fr__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__fr__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__fr__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__fr__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__fr__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__fr__ What would be the price ?
__fr__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__fr__ And so on .
__fr__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__fr__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
__fr__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__fr__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__fr__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__fr__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__fr__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__fr__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
__fr__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__fr__ That is what economists do .
__fr__ They prioritize .
__fr__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__fr__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__fr__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__fr__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__fr__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__fr__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__fr__ These were the bad projects .
__fr__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__fr__ This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__fr__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__fr__ Why is it it came up ?
__fr__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__fr__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__fr__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__fr__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__fr__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__fr__ What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__fr__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__fr__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__fr__ Yet it would do very little good .
__fr__ All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
__fr__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
__fr__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__fr__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__fr__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__fr__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__fr__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__fr__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__fr__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__fr__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__fr__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__fr__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__fr__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__fr__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__fr__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__fr__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__fr__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__fr__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__fr__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__fr__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__fr__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__fr__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__fr__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__fr__ This third best one was free trade .
__fr__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
__fr__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__fr__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__fr__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__fr__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
__fr__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
__fr__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
__fr__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__fr__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__fr__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__fr__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__fr__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__fr__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__fr__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__fr__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__fr__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__fr__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__fr__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__fr__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__fr__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__fr__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__fr__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__fr__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__fr__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__fr__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__fr__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__fr__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__fr__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__fr__ And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__fr__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__fr__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__fr__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__fr__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__fr__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__fr__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__fr__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__fr__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__fr__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__fr__ Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__fr__ Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
__fr__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__fr__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__fr__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__fr__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__fr__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__fr__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__fr__ The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
__fr__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__fr__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__fr__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__fr__ Since then our aid has halved .
__fr__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__fr__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__fr__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__fr__ I &apos;m all for that .
__fr__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__fr__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__fr__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__fr__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__fr__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__fr__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__fr__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__fr__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__fr__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__fr__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__fr__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__fr__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__fr__ There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
__fr__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__fr__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__fr__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__fr__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__fr__ I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
__fr__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__fr__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
__fr__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__fr__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__fr__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ The year is 1800 .
__fr__ A curious little invention is being talked about .
__fr__ It &apos;s called a microscope .
__fr__ What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
__fr__ Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
__fr__ Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . This is from London .
__fr__ Fast forward 200 years .
__fr__ We still have this monster soup around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
__fr__ They all have faces .
__fr__ And remember that number : one billion .
__fr__ The problem lies with the microscope itself .
__fr__ They are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
__fr__ We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
__fr__ So what is a Foldscope ?
__fr__ A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
__fr__ So , now you think , how is that possible ?
__fr__ We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
__fr__ You pop this in .
__fr__ And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
__fr__ So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these setups .
__fr__ What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-axis .
__fr__ Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
__fr__ Right there .
__fr__ All from the simple setup that I actually described .
__fr__ So it turns out they &apos;re waterproof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
__fr__ So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
__fr__ Here is a sheet of paper .
__fr__ There are some light sources .
__fr__ And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
__fr__ So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
__fr__ There it is , and it survives .
__fr__ We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscopes .
__fr__ Our world has many superheroes .
__fr__ But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
__fr__ For example , the catadores , workers who collect recyclable materials for a living .
__fr__ Catadores emerged from social inequality , unemployment , and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the waste collection system .
__fr__ Catadores provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . But they are not acknowledged for it .
__fr__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__fr__ Most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
__fr__ Carroças are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil , much like graffiti and street art .
__fr__ And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
__fr__ I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
__fr__ In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças , as a new urban support for my message .
__fr__ But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
__fr__ And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
__fr__ So , the thing is , I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
__fr__ I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide .
__fr__ And then I realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to Brazil .
__fr__ I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
__fr__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__fr__ And then , I created a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crowdfunded event .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause ) .
__fr__ So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças .
__fr__ Catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare , like physicians , dentists , podiatrists , hair stylists , massage therapists and much more .
__fr__ But also , they also receive safety shirts , gloves , raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high-definition the city , while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers .
__fr__ And then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , horns and mirrors .
__fr__ Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
__fr__ Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
__fr__ But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created Pimpx , which is inspired by TEDx , and it &apos;s a simplified , do-it-yourself , crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça .
__fr__ So now everybody can join .
__fr__ In two years , over 170 catadores , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors have been involved in the Pimp My Carroça movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school .
__fr__ So catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
__fr__ Because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__fr__ So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city .
__fr__ Try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
__fr__ Believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
__fr__ So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
__fr__ Muito obrigado , thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause ) .
__fr__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
__fr__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__fr__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__fr__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__fr__ Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__fr__ So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__fr__ This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades .
__fr__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__fr__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__fr__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__fr__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__fr__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__fr__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__fr__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__fr__ These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
__fr__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
__fr__ Everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__fr__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__fr__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__fr__ This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__fr__ So this one was taken around five .
__fr__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__fr__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__fr__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__fr__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
__fr__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__fr__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__fr__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__fr__ We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
__fr__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__fr__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__fr__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__fr__ ( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__fr__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
__fr__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__fr__ So , these are our friends in Pike Place Market , the lab .
__fr__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__fr__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__fr__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__fr__ No , no . The other way .
__fr__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__fr__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__fr__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__fr__ OK , never mind .
__fr__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__fr__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__fr__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__fr__ One of them is to take that real ...
__fr__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__fr__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__fr__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__fr__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__fr__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__fr__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__fr__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4G network from the market .
__fr__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__fr__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__fr__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__fr__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__fr__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__fr__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__fr__ So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__fr__ All right now , I &apos;ve overrun my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__fr__ Thank you all very much .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
__fr__ And let me start with this .
__fr__ This is my baseline : This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
__fr__ Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
__fr__ Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
__fr__ If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
__fr__ Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
__fr__ So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the greenish part of the picture .
__fr__ Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
__fr__ And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
__fr__ And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
__fr__ This is their baseline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
__fr__ So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
__fr__ And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the Line Islands , where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions .
__fr__ This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
__fr__ So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
__fr__ Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — overgrown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
__fr__ We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
__fr__ We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
__fr__ This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore .
__fr__ Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
__fr__ Fanning Island , 2,500 people .
__fr__ The corals are doing better here . Lots of small fish .
__fr__ This is what many divers would consider paradise .
__fr__ This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
__fr__ And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
__fr__ If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
__fr__ You can see sharks in every single dive .
__fr__ And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
__fr__ But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
__fr__ What have we learned from these places ?
__fr__ This is what we thought was natural .
__fr__ This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
__fr__ If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
__fr__ Most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
__fr__ Then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
__fr__ And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
__fr__ But this is a consequence .
__fr__ This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
__fr__ When we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
__fr__ The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
__fr__ The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more of everything .
__fr__ The size of these boxes is bigger .
__fr__ We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , more biomass of herbivores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
__fr__ They clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish .
__fr__ Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
__fr__ These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
__fr__ But still , now we have global warming .
__fr__ If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
__fr__ But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
__fr__ So how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
__fr__ Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
__fr__ In Christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
__fr__ In Fanning Island , the corals are not recovered .
__fr__ But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
__fr__ And the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
__fr__ Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
__fr__ And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
__fr__ These places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
__fr__ The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
__fr__ And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
__fr__ We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
__fr__ So if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
__fr__ Well , there are several ways .
__fr__ One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
__fr__ And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean .
__fr__ This was my baseline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
__fr__ And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
__fr__ And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
__fr__ But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
__fr__ And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
__fr__ After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
__fr__ So you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
__fr__ And this particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
__fr__ So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
__fr__ So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
__fr__ These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
__fr__ The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
__fr__ This is very substantial .
__fr__ The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
__fr__ The abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
__fr__ And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
__fr__ In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
__fr__ So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
__fr__ They reproduce . That &apos;s population biology 101 .
__fr__ If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
__fr__ And same thing for invertebrates . This is the example .
__fr__ These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
__fr__ Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
__fr__ One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
__fr__ So these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
__fr__ This is in the Bahamas : Nassau grouper .
__fr__ Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
__fr__ So the fishermen are catching more .
__fr__ You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
__fr__ So there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building resilience .
__fr__ So what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
__fr__ Reserves are like savings accounts .
__fr__ We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
__fr__ And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
__fr__ Two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
__fr__ This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a free-for-all .
__fr__ Once the most degrading fishing gear , seine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
__fr__ If you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
__fr__ But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
__fr__ Another example : Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef .
__fr__ This is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
__fr__ They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare , in one aggregation .
__fr__ Fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
__fr__ When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left .
__fr__ And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
__fr__ So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
__fr__ And with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
__fr__ It happened in many places around the Caribbean .
__fr__ And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
__fr__ Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
__fr__ So how much of this do we have ?
__fr__ If this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
__fr__ And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
__fr__ We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
__fr__ Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
__fr__ The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
__fr__ Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
__fr__ Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
__fr__ Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
__fr__ Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
__fr__ People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
__fr__ A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
__fr__ So how can we do that ?
__fr__ If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
__fr__ And how can we reach that goal ?
__fr__ Well , there are two ways of getting there .
__fr__ The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago .
__fr__ The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
__fr__ And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
__fr__ But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
__fr__ Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
__fr__ Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
__fr__ It &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
__fr__ Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
__fr__ NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
__fr__ So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
__fr__ So the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
__fr__ First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .
__fr__ It &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
__fr__ Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
__fr__ And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
__fr__ The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
__fr__ We really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
__fr__ And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
__fr__ There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
__fr__ The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
__fr__ So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric .
__fr__ Enric Sala : Thank you .
__fr__ CA : That was a masterful job of pulling things together .
__fr__ First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
__fr__ How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
__fr__ ES : Well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
__fr__ The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
__fr__ That &apos;s basically it .
__fr__ The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
__fr__ Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
__fr__ They reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
__fr__ So , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
__fr__ They are like capacitors of the system .
__fr__ CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
__fr__ So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
__fr__ ES : At least in the seas .
__fr__ What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest .
__fr__ And on land , this cannot work .
__fr__ But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
__fr__ We think this is universal .
__fr__ But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
__fr__ CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
__fr__ You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
__fr__ It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
__fr__ If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
__fr__ We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
__fr__ ES : And then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
__fr__ So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
__fr__ CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
__fr__ So thank you for those numbers .
__fr__ The last one &apos;s a personal question .
__fr__ A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
__fr__ Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
__fr__ ES : It is a spiritual experience .
__fr__ We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
__fr__ But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
__fr__ And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
__fr__ And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
__fr__ It would be just too depressing .
__fr__ CA : Well , Enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
__fr__ ES : Thank you very much .
__fr__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__fr__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__fr__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__fr__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__fr__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__fr__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__fr__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__fr__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__fr__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__fr__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__fr__ We get it in the abstract .
__fr__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__fr__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__fr__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__fr__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__fr__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__fr__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__fr__ I think this is a problem .
__fr__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__fr__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__fr__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__fr__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__fr__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__fr__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__fr__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__fr__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__fr__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__fr__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__fr__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__fr__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__fr__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__fr__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__fr__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__fr__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__fr__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__fr__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__fr__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__fr__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__fr__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__fr__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__fr__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__fr__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__fr__ I call this error blindness .
__fr__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__fr__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__fr__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__fr__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__fr__ This is not mine , by the way .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__fr__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__fr__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__fr__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__fr__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__fr__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__fr__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__fr__ Okay , so fine .
__fr__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__fr__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__fr__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__fr__ So let me tell you a story .
__fr__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__fr__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__fr__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__fr__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__fr__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__fr__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__fr__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__fr__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__fr__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__fr__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__fr__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__fr__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__fr__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__fr__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__fr__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__fr__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__fr__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__fr__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__fr__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__fr__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__fr__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__fr__ So this is a catastrophe .
__fr__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__fr__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__fr__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__fr__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__fr__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__fr__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__fr__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__fr__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__fr__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__fr__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__fr__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__fr__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__fr__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__fr__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__fr__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__fr__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__fr__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__fr__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__fr__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__fr__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__fr__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__fr__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__fr__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__fr__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__fr__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__fr__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__fr__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__fr__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__fr__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__fr__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__fr__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__fr__ And something else happened instead .
__fr__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__fr__ And something else happened instead .
__fr__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__fr__ And something else happened instead .
__fr__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__fr__ And something else happened instead .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__fr__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__fr__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__fr__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__fr__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__fr__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__fr__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__fr__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__fr__ We come up with another idea .
__fr__ We tell another story .
__fr__ We hold another conference .
__fr__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__fr__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__fr__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__fr__ On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
__fr__ Sadly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not .
__fr__ Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__fr__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__fr__ My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
__fr__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__fr__ A few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
__fr__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__fr__ That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
__fr__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__fr__ They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
__fr__ Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
__fr__ These were the men I looked up to .
__fr__ These were the men I called ammu , which means uncle .
__fr__ By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
__fr__ Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bullies .
__fr__ I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
__fr__ So what opened my eyes ?
__fr__ One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
__fr__ Through a college prep program , I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia .
__fr__ My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
__fr__ One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish .
__fr__ I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable .
__fr__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
__fr__ There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
__fr__ Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
__fr__ Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
__fr__ Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
__fr__ Then there was &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; On a nightly basis , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
__fr__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__fr__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__fr__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__fr__ I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
__fr__ So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
__fr__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__fr__ I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that I did not become fanaticized .
__fr__ For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father &apos;s actions .
__fr__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__fr__ I am not my father .
__fr__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__fr__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__fr__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__fr__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__fr__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__fr__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__fr__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
__fr__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__fr__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__fr__ It &apos;s tedious .
__fr__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__fr__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__fr__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__fr__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__fr__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__fr__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__fr__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__fr__ My idea is : no ! No !
__fr__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__fr__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__fr__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__fr__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__fr__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__fr__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__fr__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__fr__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__fr__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__fr__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__fr__ They know .
__fr__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__fr__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__fr__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__fr__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__fr__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__fr__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__fr__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__fr__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__fr__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__fr__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__fr__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
__fr__ I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
__fr__ Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
__fr__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__fr__ This is a Klein bottle .
__fr__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
__fr__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__fr__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
__fr__ It has wonderful properties .
__fr__ If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__fr__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__fr__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
__fr__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__fr__ This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__fr__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__fr__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__fr__ That was a month of my life .
__fr__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__fr__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__fr__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__fr__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__fr__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__fr__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
__fr__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__fr__ And it sent me back .
__fr__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__fr__ This guy over here of course is me .
__fr__ This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__fr__ Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__fr__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
__fr__ He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__fr__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__fr__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__fr__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__fr__ In the background , my bicycle .
__fr__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__fr__ Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
__fr__ We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__fr__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__fr__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
__fr__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
__fr__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__fr__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__fr__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__fr__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__fr__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__fr__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__fr__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
__fr__ I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
__fr__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__fr__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__fr__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
__fr__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__fr__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__fr__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
__fr__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__fr__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__fr__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__fr__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
__fr__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__fr__ You won &apos;t need to know trig .
__fr__ But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__fr__ None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
__fr__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__fr__ ( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__fr__ My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
__fr__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__fr__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__fr__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__fr__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__fr__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__fr__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__fr__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__fr__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__fr__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__fr__ But , probably — one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__fr__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__fr__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__fr__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__fr__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__fr__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__fr__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__fr__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__fr__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__fr__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__fr__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__fr__ It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
__fr__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__fr__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__fr__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__fr__ The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__fr__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__fr__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__fr__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__fr__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__fr__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__fr__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
__fr__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
__fr__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__fr__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
__fr__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
__fr__ But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__fr__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__fr__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__fr__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
__fr__ I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__fr__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
__fr__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__fr__ I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__fr__ Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
__fr__ And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
__fr__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__fr__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__fr__ He wants to clunk me over the head !
__fr__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
__fr__ It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
__fr__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__fr__ Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__fr__ Chases me into this room .
__fr__ The entranceway to the bell tower .
__fr__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__fr__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__fr__ I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
__fr__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__fr__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__fr__ I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
__fr__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__fr__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
__fr__ A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
__fr__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__fr__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__fr__ Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
__fr__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__fr__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__fr__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__fr__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__fr__ So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
__fr__ Now , I &apos;m a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress .
__fr__ It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate , it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking .
__fr__ I was having dinner with my colleague , Danny Kahneman , the Nobel Prize winner , and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window , and , you know , forgotten my passport , and Danny shared with me that he &apos;d been practicing something called prospective hindsight .
__fr__ Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage .
__fr__ So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem .
__fr__ Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
__fr__ I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
__fr__ Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
__fr__ Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
__fr__ There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
__fr__ The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged .
__fr__ It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
__fr__ They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
__fr__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__fr__ So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
__fr__ So in the home , designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
__fr__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__fr__ For your reading glasses , a particular table .
__fr__ If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
__fr__ What about travel ?
__fr__ Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
__fr__ Now these are some rather obvious things .
__fr__ Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
__fr__ Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
__fr__ So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
__fr__ And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
__fr__ And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
__fr__ So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
__fr__ Now , you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
__fr__ Now , what is this , the NNT ?
__fr__ It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
__fr__ We haven &apos;t figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
__fr__ So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
__fr__ I ran through the numbers myself .
__fr__ So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
__fr__ You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
__fr__ Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pulled this number out of the air for shock value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .
__fr__ For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 .
__fr__ That &apos;s right , 49 surgeries are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
__fr__ And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
__fr__ They include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
__fr__ And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
__fr__ So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
__fr__ You don &apos;t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
__fr__ And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
__fr__ There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
__fr__ Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
__fr__ So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
__fr__ I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
__fr__ We all are going to fail now and then .
__fr__ The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
__fr__ Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I got back from my trip , I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .
__fr__ And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
__fr__ Thank you very much .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__fr__ How could she speak that way ?
__fr__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__fr__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__fr__ How did we get here ?
__fr__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__fr__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
__fr__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__fr__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
__fr__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__fr__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__fr__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__fr__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__fr__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__fr__ Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__fr__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__fr__ How would you feel ?
__fr__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__fr__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__fr__ I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__fr__ I asked her once how things were going .
__fr__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__fr__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__fr__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__fr__ I want to know how I impact them .
__fr__ I want to know how they impact me .
__fr__ I want to know why they fish .
__fr__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__fr__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__fr__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__fr__ So what do we call this ?
__fr__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__fr__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
__fr__ Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
__fr__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__fr__ Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__fr__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__fr__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__fr__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__fr__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__fr__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__fr__ You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__fr__ Pole caught — no bycatch .
__fr__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
__fr__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__fr__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__fr__ Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
__fr__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__fr__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__fr__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__fr__ Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
__fr__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__fr__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__fr__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__fr__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__fr__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__fr__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__fr__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
__fr__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__fr__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__fr__ Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant .
__fr__ Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
__fr__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__fr__ Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__fr__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__fr__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__fr__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
__fr__ It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
__fr__ Whooo !
__fr__ This is an easy sell .
__fr__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__fr__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__fr__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__fr__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__fr__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__fr__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
__fr__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__fr__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__fr__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__fr__ So let &apos;s start there .
__fr__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__fr__ Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
__fr__ But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
__fr__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
__fr__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__fr__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__fr__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
__fr__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__fr__ Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__fr__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood .
__fr__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__fr__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__fr__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__fr__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__fr__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__fr__ A couple things happened .
__fr__ I made more money .
__fr__ People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
__fr__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__fr__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__fr__ They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
__fr__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__fr__ This is great .
__fr__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__fr__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
__fr__ Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
__fr__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__fr__ This is what we need to favor .
__fr__ This is what the green list says .
__fr__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__fr__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__fr__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__fr__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__fr__ Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
__fr__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__fr__ Put it on four plates .
__fr__ Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__fr__ Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__fr__ Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__fr__ I expect a lot from food .
__fr__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__fr__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
__fr__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__fr__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__fr__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__fr__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__fr__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__fr__ I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
__fr__ I get the meat sweats .
__fr__ It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
__fr__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__fr__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__fr__ Eat your vegetables .
__fr__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__fr__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__fr__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
__fr__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
__fr__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
__fr__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__fr__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__fr__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__fr__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__fr__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
__fr__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__fr__ We need to savor vegetables .
__fr__ We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
__fr__ And we need to save dinner .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ Hi . I am an architect .
__fr__ I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
__fr__ 1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
__fr__ It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
__fr__ Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
__fr__ This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
__fr__ There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
__fr__ As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
__fr__ In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
__fr__ Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
__fr__ I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
__fr__ So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
__fr__ My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
__fr__ My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
__fr__ After , the building was recycled .
__fr__ So that was the goal of my design .
__fr__ Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
__fr__ Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
__fr__ So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
__fr__ We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
__fr__ Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
__fr__ That was the problem .
__fr__ Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
__fr__ It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
__fr__ But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
__fr__ They have money and power .
__fr__ Those are invisible .
__fr__ So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
__fr__ That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
__fr__ So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
__fr__ But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
__fr__ For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
__fr__ That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
__fr__ Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
__fr__ So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
__fr__ We can make it better .
__fr__ So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
__fr__ 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
__fr__ Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
__fr__ Over two million people became refugees .
__fr__ But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
__fr__ They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
__fr__ But over two million people cut trees .
__fr__ It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
__fr__ That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
__fr__ Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
__fr__ So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
__fr__ We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
__fr__ And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
__fr__ Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
__fr__ And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
__fr__ So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
__fr__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
__fr__ After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
__fr__ I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
__fr__ They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
__fr__ So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
__fr__ I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
__fr__ I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
__fr__ The color coordination is very important .
__fr__ And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
__fr__ So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
__fr__ Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
__fr__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
__fr__ It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
__fr__ Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
__fr__ It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
__fr__ So this building became a permanent building .
__fr__ Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
__fr__ Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
__fr__ Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
__fr__ In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
__fr__ 2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
__fr__ In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
__fr__ And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
__fr__ I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
__fr__ I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
__fr__ In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
__fr__ It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
__fr__ In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
__fr__ And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
__fr__ And they are very kind , affording my model .
__fr__ I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
__fr__ So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
__fr__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
__fr__ Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
__fr__ Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
__fr__ This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
__fr__ After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
__fr__ But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
__fr__ People suffer mentally and physically .
__fr__ So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
__fr__ However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
__fr__ But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
__fr__ They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
__fr__ Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
__fr__ So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
__fr__ Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
__fr__ He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
__fr__ I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
__fr__ Many of the people want to stay here forever .
__fr__ I was very happy to hear that .
__fr__ Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
__fr__ About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
__fr__ And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
__fr__ So this is under construction .
__fr__ And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
__fr__ Thank you very much .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__fr__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__fr__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__fr__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
__fr__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__fr__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__fr__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__fr__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__fr__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__fr__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__fr__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__fr__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__fr__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
__fr__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__fr__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__fr__ What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
__fr__ Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__fr__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__fr__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__fr__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
__fr__ I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
__fr__ I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__fr__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__fr__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__fr__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__fr__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__fr__ On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__fr__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__fr__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__fr__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__fr__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__fr__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__fr__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__fr__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__fr__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__fr__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__fr__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
__fr__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__fr__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__fr__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__fr__ And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
__fr__ On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
__fr__ And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__fr__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__fr__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__fr__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__fr__ And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__fr__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__fr__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
__fr__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__fr__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__fr__ So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__fr__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__fr__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__fr__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__fr__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
__fr__ Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__fr__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
__fr__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__fr__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__fr__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__fr__ My son is 23 .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__fr__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__fr__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__fr__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__fr__ So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__fr__ You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
__fr__ And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__fr__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__fr__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__fr__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__fr__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__fr__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__fr__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__fr__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
__fr__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__fr__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__fr__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__fr__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__fr__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__fr__ And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__fr__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__fr__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__fr__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__fr__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__fr__ And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__fr__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__fr__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__fr__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__fr__ This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
__fr__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
__fr__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__fr__ Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__fr__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__fr__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
__fr__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__fr__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__fr__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
__fr__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__fr__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__fr__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__fr__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__fr__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__fr__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__fr__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__fr__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__fr__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__fr__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__fr__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__fr__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__fr__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__fr__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__fr__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__fr__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__fr__ Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
__fr__ What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
__fr__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__fr__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__fr__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__fr__ Same as the other side .
__fr__ Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__fr__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__fr__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__fr__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__fr__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__fr__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__fr__ Oh .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__fr__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__fr__ Not working either .
__fr__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__fr__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__fr__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__fr__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__fr__ So when you put four .
__fr__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__fr__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__fr__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__fr__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__fr__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__fr__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__fr__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__fr__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__fr__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__fr__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__fr__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__fr__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__fr__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__fr__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__fr__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__fr__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__fr__ So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
__fr__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__fr__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__fr__ So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
__fr__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__fr__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__fr__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__fr__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__fr__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__fr__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__fr__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
__fr__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__fr__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__fr__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__fr__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__fr__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__fr__ It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__fr__ We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
__fr__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__fr__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__fr__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__fr__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__fr__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__fr__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__fr__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__fr__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__fr__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__fr__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__fr__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__fr__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__fr__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__fr__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__fr__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__fr__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__fr__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__fr__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__fr__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__fr__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__fr__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__fr__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__fr__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__fr__ They work in the field .
__fr__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__fr__ They have education programs .
__fr__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__fr__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__fr__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__fr__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__fr__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__fr__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__fr__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__fr__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__fr__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__fr__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__fr__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__fr__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__fr__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__fr__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__fr__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__fr__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__fr__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__fr__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__fr__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__fr__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__fr__ This can happen .
__fr__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__fr__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__fr__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__fr__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__fr__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__fr__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__fr__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__fr__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__fr__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__fr__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__fr__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__fr__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__fr__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__fr__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__fr__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__fr__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__fr__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__fr__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__fr__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__fr__ This is the transformation that took place .
__fr__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__fr__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__fr__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__fr__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__fr__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__fr__ Thank you very much .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__fr__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__fr__ The rocket was huge .
__fr__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__fr__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__fr__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__fr__ In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__fr__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__fr__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__fr__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__fr__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__fr__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__fr__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__fr__ All hell broke loose .
__fr__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__fr__ It provoked the missile gap .
__fr__ It exploded an arms race .
__fr__ It began the space race .
__fr__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__fr__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__fr__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__fr__ Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__fr__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__fr__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__fr__ Support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
__fr__ And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__fr__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
__fr__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__fr__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
__fr__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__fr__ ( Applause ) .
__fr__ Thank you , Chris .
__fr__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__fr__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__fr__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__fr__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__fr__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__fr__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__fr__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__fr__ Let me show you what I mean .
__fr__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__fr__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__fr__ All right . Very significant mark .
__fr__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__fr__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__fr__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__fr__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__fr__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__fr__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__fr__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__fr__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__fr__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__fr__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__fr__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__fr__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__fr__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__fr__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__fr__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__fr__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__fr__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__fr__ Wake up .
__fr__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__fr__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__fr__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__fr__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__fr__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__fr__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__fr__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__fr__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__fr__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__fr__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__fr__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__fr__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__fr__ The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
__fr__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__fr__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__fr__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
__fr__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__fr__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
__fr__ And the third is a little bit less obvious .
__fr__ Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
__fr__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__fr__ I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
__fr__ My brothers and I dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
__fr__ He was livid , and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
__fr__ Later , I understood why my father got so upset .
__fr__ Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
__fr__ My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
__fr__ His was a lonely struggle , because Bihar was also India &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
__fr__ And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
__fr__ And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was famished and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
__fr__ Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
__fr__ This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
__fr__ I resolved to give back .
__fr__ Later , I joined the World Bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
__fr__ My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
__fr__ But after we disbursed the loans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
__fr__ It was Bihar all over again .
__fr__ Bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
__fr__ Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
__fr__ And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
__fr__ Second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
__fr__ And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
__fr__ Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
__fr__ Open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__fr__ The first key shift is open knowledge .
__fr__ You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
__fr__ They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
__fr__ They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
__fr__ This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades today inspiring New York City .
__fr__ And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
__fr__ This is the second shift : open aid .
__fr__ Recently , the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
__fr__ Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
__fr__ Take GeoMapping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
__fr__ So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
__fr__ In this manner , the World Bank has now GeoMapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
__fr__ This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
__fr__ And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
__fr__ From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
__fr__ Are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
__fr__ So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
__fr__ But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
__fr__ This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
__fr__ To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
__fr__ In this map from Moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
__fr__ Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
__fr__ So in the Philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__fr__ And the government is responsive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action .
__fr__ And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
__fr__ In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
__fr__ This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
__fr__ And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
__fr__ Today , even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
__fr__ But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
__fr__ These are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
__fr__ So for instance , today , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
__fr__ These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar .
__fr__ Two years ago , on April 8th , 2010 , I called my father .
__fr__ It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
__fr__ Though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . He won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
__fr__ He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
__fr__ These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
__fr__ Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
__fr__ We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
__fr__ We need to accelerate these shifts .
__fr__ If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , in Uganda , and beyond .
__fr__ We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
__fr__ We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
__fr__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__fr__ So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
__fr__ Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
__fr__ That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
__fr__ 6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
__fr__ Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
__fr__ Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
__fr__ It stops babies from dying .
__fr__ Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
__fr__ It can save over 600,000 children every year .
__fr__ That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
__fr__ I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
__fr__ So now just take a minute .
__fr__ All right , get to know each other .
__fr__ They look really pretty .
__fr__ All right .
__fr__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__fr__ Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
__fr__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__fr__ Actually , soap is available .
__fr__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__fr__ Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
__fr__ So why is it ?
__fr__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__fr__ Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__fr__ Well , in Mayank &apos;s family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
__fr__ His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cupboard .
__fr__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__fr__ What &apos;s the result of that ?
__fr__ Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
__fr__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__fr__ Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
__fr__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__fr__ Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__fr__ And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
__fr__ But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera .
__fr__ Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment .
__fr__ A hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
__fr__ I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
__fr__ Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
__fr__ The budget is not always there .
__fr__ In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap .
__fr__ Win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
__fr__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__fr__ Most of these discussions are still happening online .
__fr__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__fr__ I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
__fr__ I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
__fr__ We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
__fr__ My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
__fr__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__fr__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__fr__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__fr__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__fr__ This one is from Myanmar .
__fr__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__fr__ Her son , Myo , is her second one .
__fr__ And that &apos;s what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equip her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn .
__fr__ And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap .
__fr__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__fr__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
__fr__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__fr__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__fr__ The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__fr__ Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
__fr__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__fr__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__fr__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__fr__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__fr__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__fr__ Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
__fr__ Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
__fr__ Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
__fr__ Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orphans of the narrative .
__fr__ Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
__fr__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__fr__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__fr__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__fr__ And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
__fr__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__fr__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__fr__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__fr__ Thank you very much .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ But that can &apos;t be right .
__fr__ I am for chocolate donuts .
__fr__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__fr__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__fr__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__fr__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__fr__ So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
__fr__ A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__fr__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__fr__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__fr__ This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
__fr__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__fr__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__fr__ That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
__fr__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__fr__ So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
__fr__ So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
__fr__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__fr__ So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
__fr__ So here &apos;s a video .
__fr__ That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
__fr__ The next work is Decoy .
__fr__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__fr__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__fr__ So here is the first test scenario .
__fr__ But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
__fr__ It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__fr__ The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
__fr__ In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
__fr__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__fr__ So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
__fr__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
__fr__ It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
__fr__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__fr__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
__fr__ Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
__fr__ It comes out of the idea of a window .
__fr__ This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
__fr__ So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
__fr__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__fr__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__fr__ Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
__fr__ So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
__fr__ So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they &apos;re oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
__fr__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__fr__ These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
__fr__ So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
__fr__ So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
__fr__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__fr__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__fr__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ But then , the funniest thing happened .
__fr__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__fr__ here &apos;s my brain .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) There is a difference .
__fr__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__fr__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__fr__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__fr__ We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey .
__fr__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__fr__ Sometime soon .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ There &apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
__fr__ On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
__fr__ The column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
__fr__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
__fr__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__fr__ It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck .
__fr__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__fr__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__fr__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__fr__ There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?
__fr__ You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
__fr__ In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
__fr__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__fr__ So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
__fr__ And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
__fr__ That &apos;s why they &apos;re attracted to the military .
__fr__ These better people are attracted to this concept of service .
__fr__ But that &apos;s completely wrong .
__fr__ What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
__fr__ I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
__fr__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__fr__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__fr__ So trust and cooperation are really important here .
__fr__ The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
__fr__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__fr__ I can &apos;t simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
__fr__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__fr__ Nothing personal .
__fr__ Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
__fr__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__fr__ There are inherent benefits to this .
__fr__ It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
__fr__ Bad system of survival .
__fr__ The modern day is exactly the same thing .
__fr__ The world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
__fr__ It could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
__fr__ It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
__fr__ Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
__fr__ It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
__fr__ We have no control over these forces .
__fr__ These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
__fr__ The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
__fr__ When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong , remarkable things happen .
__fr__ I was flying on a trip , and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called , and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
__fr__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__fr__ So I said something .
__fr__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__fr__ Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
__fr__ She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
__fr__ she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
__fr__ The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
__fr__ It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
__fr__ You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weakens the organization .
__fr__ When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
__fr__ The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
__fr__ If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
__fr__ We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
__fr__ Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
__fr__ Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
__fr__ We would never do it .
__fr__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__fr__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__fr__ If you get a job at Next Jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
__fr__ In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
__fr__ It &apos;s the complete opposite .
__fr__ This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
__fr__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__fr__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__fr__ They have violated this deep-seated social contract .
__fr__ We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
__fr__ This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
__fr__ Would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to Gandhi ?
__fr__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
__fr__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__fr__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__fr__ the people to save the numbers .
__fr__ They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
__fr__ Bob Chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
__fr__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__fr__ They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed layoffs .
__fr__ And Bob refused .
__fr__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__fr__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__fr__ And so they came up with a furlough program .
__fr__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
__fr__ They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
__fr__ But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much .
__fr__ He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot , and morale went up .
__fr__ And quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
__fr__ Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
__fr__ People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
__fr__ Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
__fr__ I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
__fr__ They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
__fr__ And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
__fr__ This is what a leader is .
__fr__ I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
__fr__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__fr__ We call them leaders because they go first .
__fr__ We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
__fr__ We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
__fr__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__fr__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__fr__ And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
__fr__ Thank you very much .
__fr__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__fr__ The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
__fr__ As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
__fr__ I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ruth Tichauer , a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes .
__fr__ That is how I grew up : encouraged to see beyond any limitation .
__fr__ So part of my education included helping her in remote , indigenous communities .
__fr__ I cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
__fr__ During those trips , my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
__fr__ Go and look behind the Mountains .
__fr__ Something lost behind the mountains .
__fr__ Lost and waiting for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medical student .
__fr__ One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
__fr__ There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
__fr__ The problem starts during pregnancy .
__fr__ The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
__fr__ Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
__fr__ At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
__fr__ If it doesn &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
__fr__ It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
__fr__ But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
__fr__ As you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
__fr__ Video : ( Baby crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they seem desperate to breathe .
__fr__ To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
__fr__ One night , my friend Malte , were camping in the Amazon region .
__fr__ The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
__fr__ Then came a moment of inspiration .
__fr__ So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
__fr__ The holes in children &apos;s hearts can be closed with it .
__fr__ A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
__fr__ It maybe doesn &apos;t look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
__fr__ In this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
__fr__ The coil then closes the hole .
__fr__ After that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
__fr__ In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
__fr__ The coil , if it works , can save lives .
__fr__ I returned from Germany to Bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
__fr__ With my wife and partner , Dr. Alexandra Heath , we started to see patients .
__fr__ After successfully treating patients with our coil , we felt really enthusiastic .
__fr__ But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high .
__fr__ Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time , and they die .
__fr__ The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia .
__fr__ The search started again .
__fr__ We went back to the drawing board .
__fr__ After many trials , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
__fr__ We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape .
__fr__ It seems this time , the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn &apos;t rust because it &apos;s made of only one piece .
__fr__ It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
__fr__ As you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
__fr__ Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
__fr__ Our device expands , places itself and closes the hole .
__fr__ We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
__fr__ No open surgery was necessary .
__fr__ ( Applause ) As doctors , we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal — if they do .
__fr__ This is the child from before , after the procedure .
__fr__ As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent healed .
__fr__ From start to finish , the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes .
__fr__ That &apos;s very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
__fr__ We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us .
__fr__ Together , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
__fr__ We lost the fear of creating something new .
__fr__ The path , it &apos;s not easy .
__fr__ Many obstacles arise all the time .
__fr__ But we receive strength from our patients .
__fr__ Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
__fr__ Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
__fr__ So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
__fr__ We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
__fr__ We are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
__fr__ This whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it , really : No child is left behind .
__fr__ Muchas gracias .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
__fr__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
__fr__ The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
__fr__ So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__fr__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__fr__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__fr__ Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
__fr__ Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
__fr__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
__fr__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__fr__ and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
__fr__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__fr__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__fr__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
__fr__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__fr__ So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
__fr__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__fr__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__fr__ So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
__fr__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__fr__ And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
__fr__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__fr__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__fr__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__fr__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
__fr__ DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
__fr__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__fr__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__fr__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__fr__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause . )
__fr__ Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
__fr__ I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
__fr__ There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
__fr__ The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
__fr__ So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
__fr__ Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
__fr__ It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
__fr__ And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
__fr__ In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
__fr__ In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
__fr__ In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
__fr__ After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
__fr__ You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
__fr__ So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
__fr__ And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
__fr__ So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
__fr__ At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
__fr__ And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
__fr__ Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
__fr__ We call this value-based healthcare .
__fr__ On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
__fr__ This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
__fr__ On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
__fr__ When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
__fr__ You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
__fr__ The differences were dramatic .
__fr__ Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
__fr__ Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
__fr__ If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
__fr__ You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
__fr__ If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
__fr__ Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
__fr__ That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
__fr__ When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
__fr__ But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
__fr__ And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
__fr__ Nobody knows .
__fr__ So going the hospital is a lottery .
__fr__ Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
__fr__ In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
__fr__ To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
__fr__ They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
__fr__ They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
__fr__ So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
__fr__ &quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
__fr__ And they finally agreed .
__fr__ And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
__fr__ Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
__fr__ They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
__fr__ Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
__fr__ Since then , they publish every year .
__fr__ Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
__fr__ And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
__fr__ For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
__fr__ Now I found this principle really exciting .
__fr__ So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
__fr__ Continuous improvement .
__fr__ Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
__fr__ That &apos;s exciting in itself .
__fr__ But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
__fr__ So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
__fr__ They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
__fr__ In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
__fr__ So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
__fr__ Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
__fr__ We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
__fr__ OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
__fr__ The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
__fr__ Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
__fr__ That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
__fr__ Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
__fr__ This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
__fr__ The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
__fr__ In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
__fr__ The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
__fr__ Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
__fr__ They were always best in class .
__fr__ We were always best in class .
__fr__ And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
__fr__ But most of them don &apos;t know .
__fr__ But physicians have another characteristic .
__fr__ They actually thrive from peer recognition .
__fr__ If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
__fr__ They will share the information on how to improve .
__fr__ So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
__fr__ Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
__fr__ This is happening in reality .
__fr__ We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
__fr__ Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
__fr__ You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
__fr__ It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
__fr__ We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
__fr__ They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
__fr__ The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
__fr__ That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
__fr__ Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
__fr__ In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
__fr__ Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
__fr__ Why is that ?
__fr__ Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
__fr__ They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
__fr__ This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
__fr__ The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
__fr__ Can we measure it better than we do ?
__fr__ We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
__fr__ And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
__fr__ There was an enormous energy in the room .
__fr__ There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
__fr__ At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
__fr__ He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__fr__ Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
__fr__ I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
__fr__ You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
__fr__ That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
__fr__ I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success .
__fr__ And I wanted to try to be systematic about it , avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years .
__fr__ We learned a lot from those failures .
__fr__ So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure .
__fr__ So I looked at these five .
__fr__ First , the idea .
__fr__ I used to think that the idea was everything .
__fr__ But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the execution , adaptability , that mattered even more than the idea .
__fr__ I never thought I &apos;d be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everybody has a plan , until they get punched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well .
__fr__ The customer is the true reality .
__fr__ Then I started looking at the business model .
__fr__ Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
__fr__ Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
__fr__ And then for non-Idealab companies , I looked at wild successes , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn .
__fr__ And some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Friendster .
__fr__ The number one thing was timing .
__fr__ Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
__fr__ Some of our early successes , Citysearch , came out when people needed web pages .
__fr__ GoTo.com , which we announced actually at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic .
__fr__ Just two years later , when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America , YouTube was perfectly timed .
__fr__ Great idea , but unbelievable timing .
__fr__ In fact , YouTube didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started .
__fr__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__fr__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__fr__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__fr__ I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
__fr__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__fr__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__fr__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__fr__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__fr__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__fr__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__fr__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__fr__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__fr__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__fr__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__fr__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__fr__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__fr__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__fr__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__fr__ You see that glass of water ?
__fr__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__fr__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__fr__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__fr__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__fr__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__fr__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__fr__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__fr__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__fr__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__fr__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__fr__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__fr__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__fr__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__fr__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__fr__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__fr__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__fr__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__fr__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__fr__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__fr__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__fr__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__fr__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__fr__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__fr__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__fr__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__fr__ The light never goes out .
__fr__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__fr__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__fr__ Or is it photography ?
__fr__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__fr__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__fr__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__fr__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__fr__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__fr__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__fr__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__fr__ Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__fr__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__fr__ And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
__fr__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__fr__ When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
__fr__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__fr__ Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__fr__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__fr__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__fr__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__fr__ Is it something about the light ?
__fr__ What creates the illusion ?
__fr__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__fr__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__fr__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__fr__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__fr__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__fr__ And let me show you a simple example .
__fr__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__fr__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__fr__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__fr__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__fr__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__fr__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__fr__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__fr__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__fr__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__fr__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__fr__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__fr__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__fr__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__fr__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__fr__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__fr__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__fr__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__fr__ So here &apos;s another example .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__fr__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__fr__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__fr__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__fr__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__fr__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__fr__ The shores are from a different location .
__fr__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__fr__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__fr__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__fr__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__fr__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__fr__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__fr__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__fr__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ Now , this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions .
__fr__ There &apos;s been allegations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cellist .
__fr__ And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents .
__fr__ Now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel .
__fr__ It seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
__fr__ Why should we care about this ?
__fr__ And that affects all of us .
__fr__ Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
__fr__ I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll .
__fr__ So you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
__fr__ And that &apos;s perhaps because some prominent US people just haven &apos;t figured in this exposé , in this scandal .
__fr__ Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
__fr__ It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients .
__fr__ I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
__fr__ In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
__fr__ That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren .
__fr__ It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
__fr__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__fr__ Now , at Global Witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
__fr__ How does this actually work ?
__fr__ Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
__fr__ But as a natural optimist , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
__fr__ Over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership .
__fr__ This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
__fr__ So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
__fr__ For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
__fr__ We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
__fr__ We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Secrecy like this is not good for business . &quot;
__fr__ We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
__fr__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__fr__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__fr__ Can that possibly be true ?
__fr__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__fr__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__fr__ CA : How does it work ?
__fr__ How do people release the documents ?
__fr__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__fr__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__fr__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__fr__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__fr__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__fr__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__fr__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__fr__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__fr__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__fr__ If we can have this document up ...
__fr__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__fr__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__fr__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__fr__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__fr__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__fr__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__fr__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__fr__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__fr__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__fr__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__fr__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__fr__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__fr__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__fr__ And so it came in from the outside .
__fr__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__fr__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__fr__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__fr__ JA : Yep .
__fr__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__fr__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__fr__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__fr__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__fr__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__fr__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__fr__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__fr__ Light &apos; em all up .
__fr__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__fr__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__fr__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__fr__ we need to move , time now !
__fr__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__fr__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__fr__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__fr__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__fr__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__fr__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__fr__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__fr__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__fr__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__fr__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__fr__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__fr__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__fr__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__fr__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__fr__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__fr__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__fr__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__fr__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__fr__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__fr__ I mean , did he ?
__fr__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__fr__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__fr__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__fr__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__fr__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__fr__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__fr__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__fr__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__fr__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__fr__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__fr__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__fr__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__fr__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__fr__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__fr__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__fr__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__fr__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__fr__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__fr__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__fr__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__fr__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__fr__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__fr__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__fr__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__fr__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__fr__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__fr__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__fr__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__fr__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__fr__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__fr__ Light is good .
__fr__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__fr__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__fr__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__fr__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__fr__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__fr__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__fr__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__fr__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__fr__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__fr__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__fr__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__fr__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__fr__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__fr__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__fr__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__fr__ What is this ?
__fr__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__fr__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__fr__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__fr__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__fr__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__fr__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__fr__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__fr__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__fr__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__fr__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__fr__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__fr__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__fr__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__fr__ Yeah .
__fr__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__fr__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__fr__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__fr__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__fr__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__fr__ That &apos;s a problem .
__fr__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__fr__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__fr__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__fr__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__fr__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__fr__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__fr__ Can that be right ?
__fr__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__fr__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__fr__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__fr__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__fr__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__fr__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__fr__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__fr__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__fr__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__fr__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__fr__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__fr__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__fr__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__fr__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__fr__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__fr__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__fr__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__fr__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__fr__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__fr__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__fr__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__fr__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__fr__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__fr__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__fr__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__fr__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__fr__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__fr__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__fr__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__fr__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__fr__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__fr__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__fr__ CA : Wow .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__fr__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__fr__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__fr__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__fr__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__fr__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__fr__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__fr__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__fr__ I feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that &apos;s generally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
__fr__ In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland went on a strike .
__fr__ They did no work that day , whether they held professional jobs or had the work of the home .
__fr__ They marched into the center of Reykjavík — 90 percent of women participated — and peacefully and in solidarity asked for equality .
__fr__ Nothing worked in Iceland that day , because nothing works when women are not at work .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Five years later , Icelanders had the courage to be the first country in the world to democratically elect a woman as their president .
__fr__ I will never forget this day , that President Vigdís , as we know her by her first name , stepped out on the balcony of her own home , a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won .
__fr__ ( Applause ) This woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time , including boys .
__fr__ She frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her after a couple of terms in office and asked , &quot; &quot; Can boys really grow up to be president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Role models really matter , but even with such strong role models who I am so grateful for , when I was encouraged to run for president , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I to run for president ?
__fr__ Who am I to be president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men .
__fr__ So a study done in the US in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men had considered running for office , but 45 percent of women .
__fr__ That &apos;s gap of 16 percentage points , and it &apos;s the same gap that existed a decade earlier .
__fr__ And it really is a shame , because I am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders and more principle-based leadership in general .
__fr__ So my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit , even if I had no political experience , to step up and try to be part of creating the world that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids , and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls to be all they can be .
__fr__ And it was the journey of my life .
__fr__ It was amazing .
__fr__ The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates .
__fr__ It boiled down to nine candidates qualifying , and ultimately the race came down to four of us , three men and me .
__fr__ ( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the drama yet .
__fr__ So our sitting president of 20 years announced initially that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave rise to so many candidates considering running .
__fr__ Then later he changed his mind when our prime minister resigned following the infamous Panama Papers that implicated him and his family .
__fr__ And there was a popular protest in Iceland , so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader .
__fr__ A few days later , relations to his wife and her family &apos;s companies were also discovered in the Panama Papers , and so he withdrew from the race again .
__fr__ Before doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two qualified men who he felt could fill his shoes running for office .
__fr__ So on May 9 , 45 days before election day , it was not looking too good for me .
__fr__ I did not even make the graph in the newspaper .
__fr__ The polls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had earned .
__fr__ So it would be an understatement to say that I had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table and access to television , because the network decided that they would only include those with 2.5 percent or more in the polls in the first TV debate .
__fr__ I found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate that I would participate along with the three men , and I found out on live TV that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first TV debate .
__fr__ ( Applause ) So , challenges .
__fr__ The foremost challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with media , muscle and money .
__fr__ Let &apos;s start with media .
__fr__ There are those who say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
__fr__ I can &apos;t say that I agree .
__fr__ It proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media .
__fr__ As a matter of fact , the leading candidate appeared in broadcast media 87 times in the months leading up to the elections , whereas I appeared 31 times .
__fr__ And I am not saying media is doing this consciously .
__fr__ When I finally got access to TV , the first question I got was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to quit ? &quot; &quot; And that was a hard one .
__fr__ But of course , with 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the polls , maybe it &apos;s understandable .
__fr__ But media really matters , and every time I appeared on TV , we saw and experienced a rise in the polls , so I know firsthand how much this matters and why we have to talk about it .
__fr__ I was the only one out of the final four candidates that never got a front page interview .
__fr__ I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates and out of coverage about the elections .
__fr__ So I did face this , but I will say this to compliment the Icelandic media .
__fr__ I got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit .
__fr__ ( Applause ) So kudos to them .
__fr__ But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
__fr__ I ran as an independent candidate , not with any political party or muscle behind me .
__fr__ That lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign , but it also allowed us to innovate and do politics differently .
__fr__ We ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that .
__fr__ It may be the reason why I had less airtime on TV , because I wanted to show other contenders respect .
__fr__ When access to media proved to be so difficult , we ran our own media .
__fr__ I ran live Facebook sessions where I took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot .
__fr__ And we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook because we thought transparency is important if you want to establish trust .
__fr__ I got young people to teach me how to do that , and I used every filter on Snapchat during the last part of the campaign .
__fr__ And I actually had to use a lot of humor and humility , as I was very bad at it .
__fr__ But we grew the following amongst young people by doing that .
__fr__ So it &apos;s possible to run a different type of campaign .
__fr__ But unfortunately , one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money .
__fr__ I am sad that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less financial resources than the other candidates .
__fr__ This probably was partly due to the fact that I think I had a harder time asking for financial support .
__fr__ And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less .
__fr__ Some would call that very womanly of me .
__fr__ But even with one third the media , one third the financial resources , and only an entrepreneurial team , but an amazing team , we managed to surprise everyone on election night , when the first numbers came in .
__fr__ I surprised myself , as you may see in that photo .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I came in neck to neck to the leading candidate .
__fr__ Some people call me the real winner of the election because of this , and there are many people who encouraged me to run again .
__fr__ But what really makes me proud is to know that I earned proportionately higher percentage support from the young people , and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in 2040 .
__fr__ ( Applause ) She is 13 , and she had never been on TV before .
__fr__ And on election day , I observed her on TV repeatedly , and she was smart , she was self-confident , she was sincere , and she was supportive of her mother .
__fr__ This was probably the highlight of my campaign .
__fr__ ( Applause ) But there was another one .
__fr__ These are preschool girls out on a walk , and they found a poster of me on a bus stop , and they saw the need to kiss it .
__fr__ Audience : Aw !
__fr__ This picture was really enough of a win for me .
__fr__ What we see , we can be .
__fr__ So screw fear and challenges .
__fr__ ( Applause ) It matters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for office , be it the office of the CEO or the office of the president .
__fr__ I also managed to put an impression on your very own &quot; &quot; New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I earned a new title , &quot; &quot; A living emoji of sincerity . &quot; &quot; ( Cheers ) It is possibly my proudest title yet , and the reason is that women too often get penalized for using what I call their emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that .
__fr__ ( Applause ) And we need more of that .
__fr__ We celebrated as if we had won on election night , because that &apos;s how we felt .
__fr__ So you don &apos;t necessarily have to reach that office .
__fr__ You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow beyond anything you will experience before .
__fr__ So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this journey , probably more lessons than I can share here in the time we have today .
__fr__ But rest assured , it was hard work .
__fr__ I lost a lot of sleep during those months .
__fr__ It took resilience and perseverance to not quit , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are truly , authentically listening to your own voice and working in alignment with that .
__fr__ As a good sister of mine sometimes says , you may cheat on your intuition , but your intuition never cheats on you .
__fr__ I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any journey you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along .
__fr__ It &apos;s having people around you who share your values , your vision , but are different in every other way .
__fr__ That &apos;s the formula for success for me , and I am blessed with an amazing husband , here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena , and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible .
__fr__ As a matter of fact , the leading PR expert told me before I made my decision that I would do well to get seven percent .
__fr__ I appreciated his perspective , because he was probably right , and he was basing it on valuable experience .
__fr__ But on the one percent day , I decided here to show him that he was wrong .
__fr__ It &apos;s very important to mention this , because I did lose a lot of sleep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me .
__fr__ We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves .
__fr__ And it &apos;s two things that I think are very important in that , in surrounding yourself with people and practices that nourish you , but it &apos;s equally important , maybe even more important , to have the courage to get rid of people and practices that take away your energy , including the wonderful bloggers and commentators .
__fr__ I took a lot of support from others in doing this , and I made the decision to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s partly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this .
__fr__ And when I lost my energy for a moment — and I did from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I went back to why I decided to run , and how I had decided to run my own race .
__fr__ I called it a 4G campaign , the G &apos;s representing the Icelandic words .
__fr__ And the first one is called &quot; &quot; Gagn . &quot; &quot; I ran to do good , to be of service , and I wanted servant leadership to be at the center of how I worked and everybody else in the campaign .
__fr__ Second one is &quot; &quot; Gleði , &quot; &quot; or joy .
__fr__ I decided to enjoy the journey .
__fr__ There was a lot to be taken out of the journey , no matter if the destination was reached or not .
__fr__ And I tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as well .
__fr__ Third is &quot; &quot; Gagnsæi . &quot; &quot; I was open to any questions .
__fr__ I kept no secrets , and it was all open , on Facebook and websites .
__fr__ Because I think if you &apos;re choosing your president , you deserve answers to your questions .
__fr__ Last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we ran on the principle of Girlpower .
__fr__ ( Cheers ) I am incredibly glad that I had the courage to run , to risk failure but receive success on so many levels .
__fr__ I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my entire team will agree with me , that it was worth it .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__fr__ Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not letting you go yet . Halla Tómasdóttir : What a great crowd . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
__fr__ that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to Iceland and vote for you .
__fr__ But of course we probably can &apos;t vote there , but one thing we can get from Iceland and have always gotten is inspiration .
__fr__ I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 1975 when all the Icelandic women walked out , and that really was a very big factor in launching the women &apos;s movement .
__fr__ You made a reference to it earlier . I &apos;d love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill .
__fr__ And then what you may not know because our American media did not report it , the Icelandic women walked out again on Monday . Right ?
__fr__ HT : Yes , they did . PM : Can you tell us about that ?
__fr__ HT : Yes , so 41 years after the original strike , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done .
__fr__ ( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about this is that young women and men participated in greater numbers than before , because it is time that we close the pay gap .
__fr__ PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask Halla to commit right now to what she &apos;s doing next , but I will say that you &apos;d have a very large volunteer army should you decide to do that again .
__fr__ Thank you Halla .
__fr__ HT : Thank you all .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__fr__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__fr__ I will not dance to that beating .
__fr__ I know that beat .
__fr__ It is lifeless .
__fr__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__fr__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__fr__ I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
__fr__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__fr__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__fr__ I will not kill for you .
__fr__ Especially I will not die for you .
__fr__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__fr__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__fr__ Everyone can be wrong .
__fr__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__fr__ I will not forget where I come from .
__fr__ I will craft my own drum .
__fr__ Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
__fr__ Our humming will be drumming .
__fr__ I will not be played .
__fr__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__fr__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__fr__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__fr__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
__fr__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__fr__ ( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
__fr__ Confused , aspiring pacifists .
__fr__ I understand .
__fr__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__fr__ Like a lot .
__fr__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__fr__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
__fr__ What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__fr__ Poetry does that .
__fr__ It preps you . It aims you .
__fr__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__fr__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__fr__ Hold her now with you .
__fr__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__fr__ Are you holding her ?
__fr__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__fr__ Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
__fr__ But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__fr__ Whose son shall it be ?
__fr__ Which male child will perish a new day ?
__fr__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
__fr__ We cherish corpses .
__fr__ We mourn women , complicated .
__fr__ Bitches get beat daily .
__fr__ Profits made , prophets ignored .
__fr__ War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
__fr__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__fr__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__fr__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__fr__ Rhythm is half silence .
__fr__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__fr__ Sickness , health , tender violence .
__fr__ I think now I never was pure .
__fr__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am .
__fr__ Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
__fr__ I never was pure .
__fr__ Girl spoiled before ripened .
__fr__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__fr__ I experience exponentially .
__fr__ Everything is everything .
__fr__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__fr__ One woman loses six .
__fr__ One woman loses her head .
__fr__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__fr__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__fr__ One woman straps herself .
__fr__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__fr__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__fr__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__fr__ One woman never did .
__fr__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__fr__ Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__fr__ Faced with absence .
__fr__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
__fr__ My spine curves spiral .
__fr__ Precipice running to and running from human beings .
__fr__ Cluster bombs left behind .
__fr__ De facto landmines .
__fr__ A smoldering grief .
__fr__ Harvest contaminated tobacco .
__fr__ Harvest bombs .
__fr__ Harvest baby teeth .
__fr__ Harvest palms , smoke .
__fr__ Harvest witness , smoke .
__fr__ Resolutions , smoke .
__fr__ Salvation , smoke .
__fr__ Redemption , smoke .
__fr__ Breathe .
__fr__ Do not fear what has blown up .
__fr__ If you must , fear the unexploded .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__fr__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__fr__ Global famine was inevitable .
__fr__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
__fr__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__fr__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__fr__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__fr__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__fr__ Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__fr__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__fr__ Per-capita food production is up by a third .
__fr__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__fr__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__fr__ How did we achieve that ?
__fr__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
__fr__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__fr__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__fr__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__fr__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__fr__ These are both real objects .
__fr__ One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__fr__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__fr__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__fr__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__fr__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__fr__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__fr__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__fr__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__fr__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__fr__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__fr__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__fr__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__fr__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__fr__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__fr__ The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__fr__ And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__fr__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__fr__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__fr__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__fr__ They &apos;ve come together .
__fr__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__fr__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__fr__ In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__fr__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__fr__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
__fr__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__fr__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__fr__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__fr__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__fr__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__fr__ No other animal does it .
__fr__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__fr__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__fr__ You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
__fr__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__fr__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__fr__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__fr__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__fr__ Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__fr__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__fr__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__fr__ Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
__fr__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__fr__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__fr__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__fr__ So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
__fr__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__fr__ He can make his own spears and axes .
__fr__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__fr__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
__fr__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__fr__ And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__fr__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__fr__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__fr__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__fr__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__fr__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__fr__ You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
__fr__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__fr__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__fr__ And the answer is about half a second .
__fr__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__fr__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__fr__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__fr__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__fr__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__fr__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__fr__ It was self-sufficiency .
__fr__ We call that poverty these days .
__fr__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__fr__ How many other people ?
__fr__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__fr__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__fr__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__fr__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__fr__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__fr__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__fr__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__fr__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__fr__ Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
__fr__ They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
__fr__ He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__fr__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__fr__ They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
__fr__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__fr__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__fr__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__fr__ Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__fr__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__fr__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__fr__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__fr__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__fr__ The queen does it all .
__fr__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__fr__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__fr__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__fr__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__fr__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__fr__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__fr__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__fr__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__fr__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__fr__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__fr__ The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__fr__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
__fr__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__fr__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__fr__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__fr__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__fr__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__fr__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__fr__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__fr__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__fr__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__fr__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__fr__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
__fr__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__fr__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__fr__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__fr__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__fr__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__fr__ They &apos;re always made from local chert .
__fr__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
__fr__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__fr__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__fr__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__fr__ Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__fr__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__fr__ You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__fr__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__fr__ And that will have led to specialization .
__fr__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__fr__ Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
__fr__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__fr__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__fr__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__fr__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__fr__ An example is Tasmania .
__fr__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
__fr__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__fr__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
__fr__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__fr__ It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
__fr__ The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__fr__ The Tasmanians were isolated .
__fr__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__fr__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__fr__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__fr__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__fr__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__fr__ I mean this quite seriously .
__fr__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__fr__ He just knows how to run a company .
__fr__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__fr__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__fr__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__fr__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__fr__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__fr__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__fr__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__fr__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__fr__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
__fr__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__fr__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__fr__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__fr__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__fr__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__fr__ It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__fr__ However , bad things happen .
__fr__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__fr__ There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
__fr__ Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__fr__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__fr__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ Good afternoon .
__fr__ My name is Uldus .
__fr__ I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
__fr__ I focus on balancing meaningful message , aesthetic , beauty , composition , some irony , and artifacts .
__fr__ This boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at secondary school , he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality , trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality .
__fr__ But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Russia .
__fr__ Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
__fr__ He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting Hulk from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
__fr__ He hides his sensitivities and romantic side , because in Russia , among guys , that &apos;s not cool to be romantic , but it &apos;s cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation .
__fr__ Interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
__fr__ And what about me ?
__fr__ I &apos;m 27 years old .
__fr__ For Russian society , I &apos;m an old maid and hopeless to ever get married .
__fr__ That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask , in the wedding dress , all desperate in my garden .
__fr__ But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stereotypes .
__fr__ Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
__fr__ Be funny and create some magic .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ My name is Amit .
__fr__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__fr__ And it took 18 months .
__fr__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__fr__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__fr__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__fr__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__fr__ And I grew up in India .
__fr__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__fr__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__fr__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__fr__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__fr__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__fr__ You look around at all these museums here .
__fr__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__fr__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__fr__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__fr__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__fr__ You move around , you have fun .
__fr__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__fr__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__fr__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__fr__ Keep going . Have fun .
__fr__ Explore .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__fr__ I see this plus sign .
__fr__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__fr__ Now this is one of the images .
__fr__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__fr__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__fr__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__fr__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__fr__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__fr__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__fr__ You can zoom around very simply .
__fr__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__fr__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__fr__ But then you really want to go deep .
__fr__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__fr__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__fr__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__fr__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__fr__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__fr__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__fr__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__fr__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__fr__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__fr__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__fr__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__fr__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__fr__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__fr__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__fr__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__fr__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__fr__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__fr__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__fr__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__fr__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__fr__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__fr__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__fr__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__fr__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__fr__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__fr__ It really comes from these artists .
__fr__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__fr__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__fr__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__fr__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__fr__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__fr__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
__fr__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
__fr__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__fr__ I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
__fr__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__fr__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__fr__ Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual .
__fr__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
__fr__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
__fr__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
__fr__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__fr__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
__fr__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
__fr__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
__fr__ Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
__fr__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__fr__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
__fr__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__fr__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__fr__ It will dry up inside .
__fr__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__fr__ We all do .
__fr__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__fr__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__fr__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
__fr__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__fr__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__fr__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__fr__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__fr__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__fr__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__fr__ In my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__fr__ Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__fr__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__fr__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__fr__ My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__fr__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
__fr__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__fr__ I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__fr__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__fr__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__fr__ And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
__fr__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__fr__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__fr__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__fr__ My mother became a diplomat .
__fr__ So from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__fr__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreigner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__fr__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__fr__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__fr__ The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
__fr__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
__fr__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__fr__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__fr__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__fr__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
__fr__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__fr__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__fr__ In my mid-twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__fr__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__fr__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__fr__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__fr__ There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
__fr__ He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
__fr__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
__fr__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__fr__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__fr__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__fr__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__fr__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__fr__ I started writing fiction in English .
__fr__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__fr__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__fr__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__fr__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__fr__ When you &apos;re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__fr__ As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__fr__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__fr__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__fr__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__fr__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__fr__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__fr__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__fr__ I guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
__fr__ Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__fr__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__fr__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__fr__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__fr__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__fr__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__fr__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__fr__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__fr__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__fr__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__fr__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
__fr__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more heavily .
__fr__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__fr__ You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
__fr__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .
__fr__ Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__fr__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__fr__ The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__fr__ When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__fr__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
__fr__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__fr__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__fr__ It was only because of our passports .
__fr__ Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__fr__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__fr__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__fr__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__fr__ It comes from everywhere .
__fr__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
__fr__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__fr__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__fr__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict .
__fr__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__fr__ It was just a story .
__fr__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
__fr__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__fr__ Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__fr__ Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__fr__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
__fr__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__fr__ The other , in nuances .
__fr__ One draws boundaries .
__fr__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__fr__ Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
__fr__ Fiction is flowing water .
__fr__ In the Ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__fr__ With each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
__fr__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
__fr__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__fr__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__fr__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
__fr__ Literature has to take us beyond .
__fr__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__fr__ Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was — that I once was .
__fr__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
__fr__ When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__fr__ The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
__fr__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__fr__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__fr__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__fr__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__fr__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__fr__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__fr__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace , which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
__fr__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
__fr__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__fr__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__fr__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__fr__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
__fr__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__fr__ When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
__fr__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__fr__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__fr__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__fr__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__fr__ Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__fr__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__fr__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__fr__ Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__fr__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__fr__ We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
__fr__ In the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__fr__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__fr__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
__fr__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__fr__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
__fr__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__fr__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
__fr__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__fr__ Five million people use it every month .
__fr__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__fr__ His work is brilliant .
__fr__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__fr__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__fr__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
__fr__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__fr__ This is really exciting .
__fr__ According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__fr__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__fr__ We made this game in 2007 .
__fr__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__fr__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
__fr__ The &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
__fr__ It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Rockies .
__fr__ And the job in question was sheep rancher .
__fr__ My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
__fr__ I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
__fr__ And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
__fr__ The job in question : herding sheep . Great .
__fr__ We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
__fr__ So , normally , I never do any research at all .
__fr__ But , this is a touchy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
__fr__ So I called the Humane Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
__fr__ This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
__fr__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
__fr__ And then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
__fr__ Blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
__fr__ &quot; Great — got it . &quot;
__fr__ OK , I call the SPCA to confirm this — they confirm it .
__fr__ I also call PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confirm it .
__fr__ OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
__fr__ So the next day I go out .
__fr__ And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
__fr__ Melanie is the wife of Albert .
__fr__ Albert is the shepherd in question .
__fr__ Melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
__fr__ Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
__fr__ Alright . Great .
__fr__ Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
__fr__ I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
__fr__ Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
__fr__ Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
__fr__ And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
__fr__ And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
__fr__ In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
__fr__ A second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
__fr__ And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
__fr__ Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
__fr__ He snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what I hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
__fr__ Can we roll the video ?
__fr__ No I &apos;m kidding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
__fr__ So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
__fr__ I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
__fr__ There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scripting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
__fr__ We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse — we shoot what we get !
__fr__ I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
__fr__ We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Humane Society ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Humane Society .
__fr__ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb squeal and bleed — we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
__fr__ We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
__fr__ Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
__fr__ Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
__fr__ I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
__fr__ Gets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s quivering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
__fr__ And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
__fr__ When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
__fr__ Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
__fr__ He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
__fr__ And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
__fr__ And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German porno , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
__fr__ Albert hands me the knife .
__fr__ I go in , tail comes off .
__fr__ I go in , I grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
__fr__ Albert instructs , &quot; &quot; Push it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
__fr__ &quot; Push it further . &quot;
__fr__ I do .
__fr__ The testicles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; Bite &apos; em .
__fr__ Just bite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
__fr__ How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
__fr__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rockies , and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
__fr__ You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jacked-up metaphor ?
__fr__ I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
__fr__ I went in and I took them .
__fr__ I took them like this , and I yanked my face back .
__fr__ And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
__fr__ OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Poetics , &quot; &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
__fr__ And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__fr__ Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__fr__ Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
__fr__ Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
__fr__ It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; is .
__fr__ And I &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
__fr__ Great .
__fr__ The other word , peripeteia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know — Euripides and Sophocles — the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
__fr__ That &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
__fr__ And this metaphor in my head — I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
__fr__ When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
__fr__ I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
__fr__ Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peripetia .
__fr__ You know ?
__fr__ It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
__fr__ Neo in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
__fr__ &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
__fr__ These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
__fr__ And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK .
__fr__ Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
__fr__ Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
__fr__ And I talk to him .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
__fr__ Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
__fr__ You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
__fr__ You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
__fr__ I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
__fr__ Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
__fr__ And , after that shoot , Dirty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
__fr__ And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
__fr__ I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
__fr__ People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
__fr__ As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
__fr__ And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
__fr__ I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
__fr__ Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God — I did it with them .
__fr__ They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
__fr__ And I see it over and over and over again .
__fr__ So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
__fr__ Follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
__fr__ Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
__fr__ Probably the worst advice I ever got .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
__fr__ I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
__fr__ I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
__fr__ I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
__fr__ Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
__fr__ He &apos;s making a great living .
__fr__ You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
__fr__ The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
__fr__ He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
__fr__ He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
__fr__ And I hear that story over and over .
__fr__ Matt Froind , a dairy farmer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
__fr__ Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
__fr__ Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
__fr__ So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
__fr__ I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call &quot; &quot; successories &quot; &quot; that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now .
__fr__ That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
__fr__ Safety — safety first ?
__fr__ Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
__fr__ I mean — this is heresy , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
__fr__ Right ?
__fr__ ( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
__fr__ What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
__fr__ They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
__fr__ And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; &quot; Deadliest Catch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
__fr__ We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
__fr__ Most hazardous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
__fr__ So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
__fr__ Unspeakably dangerous .
__fr__ I scamper down , I go into the wheelhouse and I say , with some level of incredulity , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
__fr__ And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
__fr__ It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
__fr__ But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
__fr__ My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
__fr__ My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
__fr__ And for the rest of that day , safety first .
__fr__ I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
__fr__ Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
__fr__ I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
__fr__ But , what it all comes down to is this .
__fr__ I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
__fr__ It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
__fr__ It &apos;s a civil war .
__fr__ It &apos;s a cold war , really .
__fr__ We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
__fr__ And we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
__fr__ The way we portray working people on TV — it &apos;s laughable .
__fr__ If there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Admit it .
__fr__ You see him all the time .
__fr__ That &apos;s what plumbers look like , right ?
__fr__ We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
__fr__ That &apos;s what TV does .
__fr__ We try hard on &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
__fr__ But , we &apos;ve waged this war on Madison Avenue .
__fr__ I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
__fr__ Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
__fr__ Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
__fr__ I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
__fr__ And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
__fr__ How many people have their Blackberries ?
__fr__ We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
__fr__ I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
__fr__ Good grief , not to this crowd .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
__fr__ And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
__fr__ Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
__fr__ All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
__fr__ So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
__fr__ Our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
__fr__ They look like the stuff we walk around with .
__fr__ And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
__fr__ And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
__fr__ And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
__fr__ I got a lot wrong .
__fr__ So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
__fr__ Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
__fr__ I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
__fr__ Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
__fr__ The infrastructure is a huge deal .
__fr__ This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
__fr__ The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
__fr__ Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
__fr__ The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
__fr__ Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
__fr__ So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
__fr__ And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
__fr__ They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
__fr__ It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__fr__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
__fr__ of sleep-deprived women .
__fr__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__fr__ Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
__fr__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__fr__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__fr__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__fr__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__fr__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
__fr__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__fr__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__fr__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__fr__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__fr__ So a high I.Q.
__fr__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__fr__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__fr__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__fr__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__fr__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__fr__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
__fr__ And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
__fr__ Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
__fr__ It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
__fr__ And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
__fr__ OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
__fr__ I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
__fr__ How does this happen ?
__fr__ Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
__fr__ One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
__fr__ What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
__fr__ What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
__fr__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__fr__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__fr__ So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
__fr__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__fr__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__fr__ If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
__fr__ And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
__fr__ And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
__fr__ You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
__fr__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__fr__ I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
__fr__ OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
__fr__ But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
__fr__ This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
__fr__ She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
__fr__ Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
__fr__ Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
__fr__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__fr__ This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud .
__fr__ I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Freudian view .
__fr__ And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
__fr__ Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
__fr__ And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
__fr__ And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
__fr__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__fr__ This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
__fr__ It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Freudian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( Laughter )
__fr__ He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__fr__ Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__fr__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__fr__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__fr__ Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
__fr__ There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
__fr__ There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
__fr__ You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
__fr__ I talked about that earlier .
__fr__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__fr__ But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
__fr__ Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
__fr__ Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?
__fr__ Which you can completely ignore .
__fr__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
__fr__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__fr__ You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
__fr__ And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
__fr__ So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?
__fr__ And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
__fr__ So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
__fr__ And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
__fr__ But maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
__fr__ So because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
__fr__ ( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?
__fr__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__fr__ It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
__fr__ Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
__fr__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
__fr__ And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
__fr__ You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
__fr__ You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
__fr__ Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
__fr__ There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
__fr__ So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
__fr__ It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
__fr__ By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
__fr__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__fr__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__fr__ The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
__fr__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__fr__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
__fr__ OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
__fr__ Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
__fr__ And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
__fr__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__fr__ When an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
__fr__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__fr__ Believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
__fr__ I &apos;ve had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
__fr__ And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;
__fr__ ( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that .
__fr__ OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
__fr__ One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
__fr__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__fr__ These are very compelling , vivid sensations .
__fr__ The patient &apos;s not delusional .
__fr__ He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
__fr__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__fr__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__fr__ It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
__fr__ If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
__fr__ It sounds like an oxymoron .
__fr__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__fr__ The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
__fr__ So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
__fr__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__fr__ Patients become depressed .
__fr__ Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
__fr__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__fr__ Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
__fr__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__fr__ Why does this happen ?
__fr__ When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
__fr__ And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
__fr__ The brain learns , because of this Hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
__fr__ And then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?
__fr__ Now , how do you help these patients ?
__fr__ How do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
__fr__ Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
__fr__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
__fr__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__fr__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__fr__ So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
__fr__ You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
__fr__ He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
__fr__ He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
__fr__ He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__fr__ It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
__fr__ So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
__fr__ And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
__fr__ He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
__fr__ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
__fr__ That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started giggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
__fr__ He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
__fr__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__fr__ And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__fr__ And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes .
__fr__ &quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
__fr__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;
__fr__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__fr__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__fr__ So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
__fr__ So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
__fr__ But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
__fr__ So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
__fr__ Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
__fr__ I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
__fr__ It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
__fr__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
__fr__ But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
__fr__ Now , why does this happen ?
__fr__ It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
__fr__ It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
__fr__ On the other hand , there &apos;s no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
__fr__ And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
__fr__ It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
__fr__ And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
__fr__ So , that &apos;s the bonus .
__fr__ Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
__fr__ Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
__fr__ But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
__fr__ This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
__fr__ OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
__fr__ This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
__fr__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__fr__ He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
__fr__ Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ?
__fr__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__fr__ Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
__fr__ C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
__fr__ Why does this happen ?
__fr__ This is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
__fr__ In us , all the senses are distinct .
__fr__ These people muddle up their senses .
__fr__ Why does this happen ?
__fr__ One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
__fr__ Synesthesia runs in families , so Galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
__fr__ Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
__fr__ Why would that be ?
__fr__ I &apos;m going to answer that question .
__fr__ It &apos;s never been answered before .
__fr__ OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
__fr__ Well , there are many theories .
__fr__ One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
__fr__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__fr__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
__fr__ Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?
__fr__ So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
__fr__ So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
__fr__ So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia .
__fr__ Now remember — why does this happen ?
__fr__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__fr__ Remember I said it runs in families ?
__fr__ That gives you the clue .
__fr__ And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
__fr__ In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
__fr__ So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
__fr__ So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
__fr__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
__fr__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
__fr__ So far , so good .
__fr__ Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
__fr__ Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?
__fr__ I mean , schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
__fr__ Normal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun .
__fr__ Instantly , you &apos;ve found the links .
__fr__ Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
__fr__ And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
__fr__ OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
__fr__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__fr__ ( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetes , but you &apos;re in denial about it .
__fr__ Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
__fr__ Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
__fr__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__fr__ One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
__fr__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__fr__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__fr__ Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
__fr__ ( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands .
__fr__ Ninety-nine percent of you .
__fr__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__fr__ It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
__fr__ Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
__fr__ It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
__fr__ If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glitters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
__fr__ You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
__fr__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__fr__ Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
__fr__ And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
__fr__ All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Sorry about that .
__fr__ ( Laughter )
__fr__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__fr__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
__fr__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
__fr__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__fr__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__fr__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__fr__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__fr__ Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
__fr__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__fr__ I had to do something .
__fr__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__fr__ So I tried bronze casting .
__fr__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__fr__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__fr__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
__fr__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__fr__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
__fr__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__fr__ I was mesmerized .
__fr__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
__fr__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__fr__ Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
__fr__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
__fr__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__fr__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__fr__ Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__fr__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
__fr__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__fr__ So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
__fr__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__fr__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__fr__ I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
__fr__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__fr__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__fr__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
__fr__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
__fr__ So we had to create one .
__fr__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
__fr__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__fr__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
__fr__ Now it had a sense of place .
__fr__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__fr__ As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__fr__ My life was not going to be the same .
__fr__ I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__fr__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__fr__ Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
__fr__ So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__fr__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__fr__ Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__fr__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__fr__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__fr__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
__fr__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__fr__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
__fr__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__fr__ Its shape was too complex now .
__fr__ So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__fr__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__fr__ There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__fr__ So we had to create it .
__fr__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__fr__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__fr__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__fr__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__fr__ Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
__fr__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__fr__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__fr__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__fr__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__fr__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
__fr__ Thank you .
__fr__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__fr__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__fr__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__fr__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__fr__ ( Applause )
__fr__ So when I was a kid ...
__fr__ So it makes sense that we &apos;ve headed in this direction .
__fr__ So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
__fr__ Many people don &apos;t know this but tuna are warm-blooded .
__fr__ There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut .
__fr__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__fr__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__fr__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__fr__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__fr__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__fr__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__fr__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__fr__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__fr__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__fr__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__fr__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__fr__ And I felt lighter in my body .
