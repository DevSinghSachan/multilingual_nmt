__de__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__de__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__de__ While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__de__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__de__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__de__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__de__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__de__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__de__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__de__ There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
__de__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__de__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__de__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__de__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__de__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__de__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__de__ One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
__de__ ( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
__de__ Death : Adam ?
__de__ AO : Yeah .
__de__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
__de__ AO : Who is this ?
__de__ Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
__de__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__de__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
__de__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__de__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__de__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__de__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__de__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__de__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__de__ One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__de__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
__de__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__de__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__de__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__de__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__de__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__de__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__de__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ ( Guitar ) ( Singing ) Rollercoaster , carousel .
__de__ You can grab the ring , you can ring that bell , when the ride is over , you can never tell .
__de__ People tell you this one thing — will make your life complete .
__de__ So you , you give it everything you got and you wind up on the street .
__de__ Then one day you wake up , and they tell you &quot; &quot; you &apos;re a queen , &quot; &quot; but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings .
__de__ Rollercoaster , carousel .
__de__ Where the highs are heaven , but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
__de__ Where the highs are heaven but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
__de__ Well , maybe I &apos;m just cynical , and all these words are lies , but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise .
__de__ But caution makes you hesitate , and hesitate you &apos;re lost , so take your opportunities and never count the cost .
__de__ Rollercoaster , carousel .
__de__ Carousel , carousel , carousel , carousel .
__de__ ( Applause ) Michael Pemberton . ( Applause )
__de__ Thank you so much .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__de__ Now I work in the solar technology industry .
__de__ And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
__de__ ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
__de__ It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
__de__ Huh . Hang on a moment .
__de__ It might take a moment to load .
__de__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
__de__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__de__ ( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
__de__ Okay . ( Laughter )
__de__ Solar technology is ...
__de__ Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
__de__ Okay . Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
__de__ So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
__de__ Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years , so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights .
__de__ I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties — super interesting .
__de__ But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way , in a way that could really make a difference .
__de__ So Chris cut right to the chase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
__de__ &quot; Yes , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
__de__ &quot; &quot; No !
__de__ You &apos;re telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body ?
__de__ That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
__de__ And 20 minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
__de__ &quot; Oh my god ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we sue ? &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
__de__ I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
__de__ First , we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene .
__de__ Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of these are to so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — namely , a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell .
__de__ And the patents weren &apos;t just to a particular gene that they isolated , but on every possible version of that gene .
__de__ So what does that mean ?
__de__ It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing .
__de__ But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it .
__de__ Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
__de__ But was there a way we could challenge them ?
__de__ And you can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
__de__ These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none .
__de__ It seemed to us that DNA , the most fundamental structure of life , that codes for the production of all of our proteins , is both a product of nature and a law of nature , regardless of whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube .
__de__ Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
__de__ Why is that ?
__de__ There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
__de__ So we set out to build our case .
__de__ We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation .
__de__ We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics , a company that &apos;s based in Salt Lake City , Utah .
__de__ Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer .
__de__ It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community .
__de__ And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
__de__ This is Kathleen Maxian .
__de__ Kathleen &apos;s sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad .
__de__ The test was negative .
__de__ The family was relieved .
__de__ That meant that Eileen &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other members of her family didn &apos;t need to be tested .
__de__ It turned out that Kathleen &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result .
__de__ Had Eileen received the proper result , Kathleen would have then been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
__de__ One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
__de__ So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention , and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
__de__ How is DNA isolated , and why isn &apos;t that an invention ?
__de__ You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
__de__ And the gold , once it &apos;s extracted , can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the mountain ; you can make jewelry out of it for example — still can &apos;t patent the gold , it &apos;s still gold .
__de__ So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
__de__ I mean , our brief — it was pretty good , but not this good .
__de__ How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
__de__ We just could not comprehend how this had happened .
__de__ And here things got really interesting .
__de__ First , in a pivotal moment of this case , the US government switched sides .
__de__ But now in direct opposition to its own patent office , the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court &apos;s opinion , and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible .
__de__ And we did .
__de__ Ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
__de__ But the two judges who ruled against us , did so for completely different reasons .
__de__ The first one , Judge Lourie , made up his own novel , biological theory — totally wrong .
__de__ But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Judge Bryson , agreed with us .
__de__ So now we sought review by the Supreme Court .
__de__ And when you petition the Supreme Court , you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer .
__de__ Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph , like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses , &quot; wherein this &quot; and &quot; therefore that . &quot;
__de__ We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
__de__ Four words : Are human genes patentable ?
__de__ Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
__de__ I think you have to say , &apos; Is isolated DNA patentable ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nope .
__de__ I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
__de__ Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway , moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career .
__de__ Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the co-discoverer of DNA himself , James Watson , who had submitted a brief to the court , where he referred to gene patenting as &quot; &quot; lunacy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake .
__de__ The argument itself was riveting .
__de__ Chris argued brilliantly .
__de__ Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon .
__de__ Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
__de__ And in one of my absolutely favorite moments , Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day , but I could never have anticipated the outcome : nine to zero .
__de__ Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad &apos;s .
__de__ Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering .
__de__ But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
__de__ It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation .
__de__ A few weeks after the court issued its decision , I received a small package in the mail .
__de__ It was from Bob Cook-Deegan , a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case .
__de__ I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal .
__de__ Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
__de__ The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many twists and turns along the way .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__de__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__de__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__de__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__de__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__de__ Where are economic networks ?
__de__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__de__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__de__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__de__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
__de__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__de__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
__de__ We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
__de__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__de__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__de__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__de__ And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
__de__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__de__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__de__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__de__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__de__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
__de__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__de__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__de__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__de__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__de__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
__de__ The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__de__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__de__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__de__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__de__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__de__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__de__ And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
__de__ So this is how it works .
__de__ This is a video prototype .
__de__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__de__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__de__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
__de__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__de__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__de__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__de__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__de__ So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__de__ So this is a very early prototype .
__de__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__de__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
__de__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__de__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__de__ So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__de__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__de__ On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__de__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__de__ Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__de__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__de__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__de__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__de__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__de__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__de__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__de__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__de__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
__de__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
__de__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__de__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__de__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__de__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__de__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__de__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__de__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__de__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__de__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__de__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__de__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__de__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__de__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__de__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__de__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__de__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
__de__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__de__ So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__de__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__de__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__de__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__de__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
__de__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__de__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__de__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ This is what life needs to survive , all life .
__de__ Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
__de__ I love the Internet .
__de__ It &apos;s true .
__de__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__de__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__de__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__de__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__de__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__de__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__de__ So let me show you something .
__de__ This here is Brain .
__de__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__de__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__de__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__de__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__de__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__de__ All right .
__de__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__de__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__de__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__de__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__de__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__de__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__de__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__de__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__de__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__de__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__de__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
__de__ And I knocked on the door .
__de__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__de__ Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Basit .
__de__ Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
__de__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__de__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__de__ I asked them why .
__de__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__de__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__de__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__de__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__de__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__de__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__de__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__de__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__de__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__de__ For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
__de__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__de__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__de__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__de__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__de__ ( Siren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__de__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__de__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__de__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__de__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__de__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__de__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__de__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__de__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
__de__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__de__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__de__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__de__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__de__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__de__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__de__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
__de__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__de__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__de__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__de__ So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
__de__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
__de__ Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__de__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__de__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__de__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__de__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__de__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__de__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__de__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__de__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__de__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__de__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__de__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__de__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
__de__ We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
__de__ These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
__de__ They are both right now on the run .
__de__ Nobody knows where they are .
__de__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__de__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__de__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__de__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
__de__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
__de__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__de__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__de__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__de__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__de__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__de__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__de__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__de__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__de__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__de__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__de__ How do you actually track them down ?
__de__ Let me give you an example .
__de__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__de__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__de__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__de__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__de__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
__de__ It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
__de__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__de__ And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
__de__ Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
__de__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__de__ But just keep staring at it .
__de__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__de__ And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
__de__ But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
__de__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__de__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__de__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__de__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__de__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__de__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__de__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
__de__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
__de__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__de__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__de__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__de__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__de__ And he drives a very nice car .
__de__ In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__de__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
__de__ How do I know about this car ?
__de__ Because he blogged about the car .
__de__ He actually had a car accident .
__de__ In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__de__ And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
__de__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
__de__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
__de__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__de__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__de__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__de__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__de__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__de__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__de__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__de__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__de__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__de__ That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__de__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__de__ This is what runs everything around us .
__de__ PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__de__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__de__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__de__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__de__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__de__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__de__ Everything is being run by computers .
__de__ Everything is reliant on these computers working .
__de__ We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__de__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__de__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__de__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__de__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__de__ Think about all the services we have online .
__de__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__de__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__de__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__de__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__de__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__de__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__de__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
__de__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__de__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__de__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__de__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__de__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__de__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__de__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__de__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__de__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__de__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__de__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__de__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__de__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__de__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__de__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__de__ This is an illusion .
__de__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__de__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__de__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__de__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__de__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__de__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__de__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__de__ We can &apos;t .
__de__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__de__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__de__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__de__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__de__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__de__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__de__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__de__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__de__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__de__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__de__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__de__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__de__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__de__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__de__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__de__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__de__ And what does it mean ?
__de__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__de__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__de__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__de__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__de__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__de__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__de__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__de__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__de__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__de__ One country , two systems .
__de__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__de__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__de__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__de__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__de__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__de__ What happened ?
__de__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__de__ One nation , one system .
__de__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__de__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__de__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__de__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__de__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__de__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__de__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__de__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__de__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__de__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__de__ So the question is , why ?
__de__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__de__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__de__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__de__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__de__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__de__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__de__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__de__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__de__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__de__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__de__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__de__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__de__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__de__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__de__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__de__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__de__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__de__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__de__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__de__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__de__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__de__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__de__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__de__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__de__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__de__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__de__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__de__ The state is everywhere in China .
__de__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__de__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__de__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__de__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__de__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__de__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__de__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__de__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__de__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__de__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__de__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__de__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__de__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__de__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__de__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__de__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__de__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__de__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__de__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__de__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__de__ But it &apos;s not .
__de__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__de__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__de__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__de__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__de__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__de__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__de__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__de__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__de__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__de__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__de__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__de__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__de__ And there are two consequences of this .
__de__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__de__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__de__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__de__ When did that last happen ?
__de__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__de__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__de__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__de__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__de__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__de__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__de__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__de__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__de__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__de__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__de__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__de__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__de__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__de__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__de__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__de__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__de__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__de__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__de__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__de__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__de__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__de__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__de__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__de__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__de__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__de__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__de__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__de__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__de__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__de__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__de__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__de__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__de__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__de__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__de__ By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__de__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__de__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__de__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__de__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__de__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__de__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__de__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__de__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__de__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__de__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__de__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__de__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__de__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__de__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__de__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__de__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__de__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__de__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__de__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__de__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__de__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__de__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__de__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__de__ Last .
__de__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
__de__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__de__ And these are facts , guys .
__de__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
__de__ It &apos;s not .
__de__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__de__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__de__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__de__ We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__de__ How did this happen ?
__de__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__de__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
__de__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__de__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__de__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__de__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__de__ We don &apos;t value play .
__de__ In fact , we devalue play .
__de__ And we devalue it in three areas .
__de__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__de__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__de__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__de__ And instead , what do we value ?
__de__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__de__ To be serious .
__de__ To be really , really serious .
__de__ It did .
__de__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__de__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__de__ Heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
__de__ I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__de__ We have a serious meme running through .
__de__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__de__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__de__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__de__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . Iskam baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woohoo !
__de__ But then what happens in step three ?
__de__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
__de__ I &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
__de__ But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__de__ So what happens ?
__de__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__de__ What happens then ?
__de__ It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__de__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__de__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__de__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__de__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__de__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
__de__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__de__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__de__ We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
__de__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__de__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__de__ What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
__de__ Autocratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__de__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__de__ Untrusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__de__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.M.
__de__ That &apos;s somehow unprofessional and bad .
__de__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s unfulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__de__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__de__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__de__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__de__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__de__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__de__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__de__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__de__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__de__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__de__ And you know what ?
__de__ Evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that aren &apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__de__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__de__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . Ants play .
__de__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__de__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__de__ Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__de__ Kittens play . We all know kittens play .
__de__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__de__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__de__ Bears play .
__de__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__de__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__de__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__de__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__de__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__de__ Dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__de__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__de__ Yours truly : humans .
__de__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__de__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__de__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__de__ Really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__de__ And who are the biggest neotenists ?
__de__ Humans . We play sports .
__de__ We do it for fun , or as Olympians , or as professionals .
__de__ We play musical instruments .
__de__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
__de__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__de__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__de__ It is a huge benefit .
__de__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__de__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__de__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__de__ As a result , what happens ?
__de__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__de__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__de__ These guys are facts .
__de__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__de__ These are the benefits to play .
__de__ It is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__de__ And if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
__de__ We hold ourselves back .
__de__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__de__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__de__ What does this world look like ?
__de__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__de__ It &apos;s pretty glum .
__de__ Now imagine your workplace .
__de__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__de__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__de__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__de__ Or is it crap ? Is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
__de__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__de__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__de__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__de__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__de__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__de__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__de__ In fact , play improves our work .
__de__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__de__ For example , it stimulates creativity .
__de__ It increases our openness to change .
__de__ It improves our ability to learn .
__de__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__de__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__de__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__de__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
__de__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__de__ Our thinking is backwards .
__de__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__de__ We should be celebrating play .
__de__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__de__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__de__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__de__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__de__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__de__ And what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
__de__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__de__ People , service , profit .
__de__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__de__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__de__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__de__ One , play is universal .
__de__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__de__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sciant .
__de__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__de__ Not one customer would refer us .
__de__ I asked them all .
__de__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__de__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__de__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
__de__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__de__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__de__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__de__ Basically promoting fun .
__de__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__de__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
__de__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__de__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__de__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__de__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__de__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__de__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__de__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__de__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__de__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__de__ Rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__de__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__de__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__de__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__de__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__de__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__de__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__de__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__de__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__de__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__de__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__de__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__de__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__de__ Let them be on the Internet .
__de__ Let them be on instant messengers .
__de__ Let them take long lunches .
__de__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__de__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__de__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__de__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__de__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__de__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__de__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__de__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__de__ of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__de__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__de__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__de__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__de__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__de__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__de__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__de__ So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
__de__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__de__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__de__ Even the BBC and The New York Times .
__de__ So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__de__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__de__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__de__ And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
__de__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__de__ For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
__de__ If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
__de__ We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__de__ So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
__de__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__de__ I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
__de__ And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__de__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__de__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__de__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__de__ This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied .
__de__ We make ourselves small .
__de__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__de__ So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
__de__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__de__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__de__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__de__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__de__ So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
__de__ Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__de__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__de__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__de__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__de__ There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
__de__ So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
__de__ So it goes both ways .
__de__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__de__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__de__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__de__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
__de__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__de__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__de__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__de__ So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__de__ Probably not , right ?
__de__ So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
__de__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__de__ Here are a couple more .
__de__ So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
__de__ And here are the low-power poses .
__de__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__de__ When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
__de__ So this is what happens .
__de__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__de__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__de__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__de__ Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
__de__ So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__de__ Also , our bodies change our minds .
__de__ And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
__de__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__de__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__de__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__de__ It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
__de__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
__de__ People hate this .
__de__ We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
__de__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__de__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__de__ These kinds of things .
__de__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
__de__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__de__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__de__ I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
__de__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__de__ I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
__de__ I was thrown from the car .
__de__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__de__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__de__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__de__ I am an impostor .
__de__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__de__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__de__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__de__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__de__ So she had changed .
__de__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__de__ Fake it till you become it .
__de__ Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
__de__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__de__ Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
__de__ So , this is two minutes .
__de__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__de__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__de__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
__de__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__de__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__de__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__de__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__de__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__de__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__de__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__de__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__de__ This is a time of need .
__de__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__de__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__de__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__de__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__de__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__de__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__de__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__de__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__de__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__de__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__de__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__de__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__de__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__de__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__de__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__de__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__de__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__de__ The earth moved for both of them .
__de__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__de__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__de__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__de__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__de__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__de__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__de__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__de__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__de__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
__de__ All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
__de__ So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
__de__ Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
__de__ BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
__de__ BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
__de__ Audience : What are you reading ?
__de__ BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
__de__ I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
__de__ It literally says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
__de__ That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
__de__ It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
__de__ Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
__de__ All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ow ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
__de__ But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
__de__ And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
__de__ Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
__de__ But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
__de__ Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
__de__ They begin with a question .
__de__ The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
__de__ Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
__de__ Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
__de__ Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
__de__ Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
__de__ The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
__de__ And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
__de__ So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
__de__ And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
__de__ They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
__de__ It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
__de__ So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
__de__ It &apos;s play .
__de__ Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
__de__ Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
__de__ Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
__de__ Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
__de__ Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
__de__ It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
__de__ So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
__de__ That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
__de__ So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
__de__ And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
__de__ Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
__de__ The first step was to ask a question .
__de__ Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
__de__ So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
__de__ So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
__de__ So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
__de__ Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
__de__ She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
__de__ Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
__de__ Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
__de__ So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
__de__ Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
__de__ But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
__de__ So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
__de__ Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
__de__ Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
__de__ But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
__de__ AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
__de__ We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
__de__ They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
__de__ Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
__de__ What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
__de__ It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
__de__ It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
__de__ So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
__de__ ( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5C .
__de__ Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
__de__ Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
__de__ BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
__de__ Student : There &apos;s two up there .
__de__ And three in here .
__de__ BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
__de__ They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
__de__ And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
__de__ So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
__de__ So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
__de__ The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
__de__ Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
__de__ And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
__de__ That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
__de__ It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
__de__ So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
__de__ All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
__de__ The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
__de__ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
__de__ Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
__de__ The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
__de__ They say no .
__de__ So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
__de__ And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
__de__ What was the feedback like ?
__de__ Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
__de__ It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
__de__ It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
__de__ It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
__de__ Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
__de__ And I &apos;ll just read one .
__de__ &quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
__de__ What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
__de__ Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
__de__ Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
__de__ Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
__de__ Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
__de__ Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
__de__ Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
__de__ BL : This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
__de__ Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
__de__ You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
__de__ ( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
__de__ Audience : ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
__de__ Everyone over there shout . ( Shouts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
__de__ Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
__de__ That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
__de__ Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
__de__ So , Amy ?
__de__ AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
__de__ Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
__de__ But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
__de__ You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
__de__ Thank you.BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__de__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__de__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__de__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__de__ So get out your pen and paper .
__de__ Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__de__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__de__ There are 800 million people starving .
__de__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__de__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__de__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__de__ The lists go on and on .
__de__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__de__ There are many , many problems out there .
__de__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__de__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__de__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__de__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__de__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__de__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__de__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__de__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__de__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__de__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__de__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__de__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__de__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__de__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__de__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__de__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__de__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__de__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__de__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__de__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__de__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__de__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__de__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__de__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__de__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__de__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__de__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__de__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__de__ And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__de__ Nobody wants to do this .
__de__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__de__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__de__ And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__de__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__de__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
__de__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__de__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__de__ We have not had an idea .
__de__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__de__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__de__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__de__ It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
__de__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__de__ And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__de__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
__de__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__de__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__de__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__de__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__de__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__de__ What would be the price ?
__de__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__de__ And so on .
__de__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__de__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
__de__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__de__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__de__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__de__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__de__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__de__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
__de__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__de__ That is what economists do .
__de__ They prioritize .
__de__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__de__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__de__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__de__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__de__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__de__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__de__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__de__ These were the bad projects .
__de__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__de__ This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__de__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__de__ Why is it it came up ?
__de__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__de__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__de__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__de__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__de__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__de__ What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__de__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__de__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__de__ Yet it would do very little good .
__de__ All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
__de__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
__de__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__de__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__de__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__de__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__de__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__de__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__de__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__de__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__de__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__de__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__de__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__de__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__de__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__de__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__de__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__de__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__de__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__de__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__de__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__de__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__de__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__de__ This third best one was free trade .
__de__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
__de__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__de__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__de__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__de__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
__de__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
__de__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
__de__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__de__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__de__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__de__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__de__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__de__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__de__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__de__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__de__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__de__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__de__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__de__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__de__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__de__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__de__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__de__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__de__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__de__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__de__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__de__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__de__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__de__ And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__de__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__de__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__de__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__de__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__de__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__de__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__de__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__de__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__de__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__de__ Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__de__ Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
__de__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__de__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__de__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__de__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__de__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__de__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__de__ The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
__de__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__de__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__de__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__de__ Since then our aid has halved .
__de__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__de__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__de__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__de__ I &apos;m all for that .
__de__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__de__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__de__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__de__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__de__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__de__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__de__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__de__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__de__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__de__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__de__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__de__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__de__ There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
__de__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__de__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__de__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__de__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__de__ I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
__de__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__de__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
__de__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__de__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__de__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ Our world has many superheroes .
__de__ But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
__de__ For example , the catadores , workers who collect recyclable materials for a living .
__de__ Catadores provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . But they are not acknowledged for it .
__de__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__de__ Most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
__de__ They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and carroças .
__de__ Carroças are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil , much like graffiti and street art .
__de__ And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
__de__ I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
__de__ In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças , as a new urban support for my message .
__de__ But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
__de__ By adding art and humor to the cause , it became more appealing , which helped call attention to the catadores and improve their self-esteem .
__de__ And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
__de__ So , the thing is , I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
__de__ I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide .
__de__ And then I realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to Brazil .
__de__ I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
__de__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) .
__de__ So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças .
__de__ But also , they also receive safety shirts , gloves , raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high-definition the city , while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers .
__de__ And then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , horns and mirrors .
__de__ Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
__de__ Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
__de__ But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created Pimpx , which is inspired by TEDx , and it &apos;s a simplified , do-it-yourself , crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça .
__de__ So now everybody can join .
__de__ So catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
__de__ Because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__de__ Try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
__de__ Believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
__de__ So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
__de__ Muito obrigado , thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) .
__de__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
__de__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__de__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__de__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__de__ Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__de__ So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__de__ This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades .
__de__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__de__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__de__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__de__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__de__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__de__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__de__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__de__ These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
__de__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
__de__ Everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__de__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__de__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__de__ This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__de__ So this one was taken around five .
__de__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__de__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__de__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
__de__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__de__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__de__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__de__ We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
__de__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__de__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__de__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__de__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__de__ ( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__de__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
__de__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__de__ So , these are our friends in Pike Place Market , the lab .
__de__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__de__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__de__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__de__ No , no . The other way .
__de__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__de__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__de__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__de__ OK , never mind .
__de__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__de__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__de__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__de__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__de__ One of them is to take that real ...
__de__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__de__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__de__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__de__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__de__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__de__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__de__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4G network from the market .
__de__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__de__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__de__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__de__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__de__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__de__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__de__ So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__de__ All right now , I &apos;ve overrun my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__de__ Thank you all very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
__de__ And let me start with this .
__de__ This is my baseline : This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
__de__ Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
__de__ Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
__de__ If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
__de__ Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
__de__ So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the greenish part of the picture .
__de__ Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
__de__ And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
__de__ And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
__de__ This is their baseline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
__de__ So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
__de__ And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the Line Islands , where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions .
__de__ This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
__de__ So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
__de__ Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — overgrown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
__de__ We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
__de__ We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
__de__ This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore .
__de__ Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
__de__ Fanning Island , 2,500 people .
__de__ The corals are doing better here . Lots of small fish .
__de__ This is what many divers would consider paradise .
__de__ This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
__de__ And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
__de__ If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
__de__ You can see sharks in every single dive .
__de__ And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
__de__ But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
__de__ What have we learned from these places ?
__de__ This is what we thought was natural .
__de__ This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
__de__ If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
__de__ Most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
__de__ Then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
__de__ And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
__de__ But this is a consequence .
__de__ This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
__de__ When we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
__de__ The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
__de__ The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more of everything .
__de__ The size of these boxes is bigger .
__de__ We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , more biomass of herbivores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
__de__ They clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish .
__de__ Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
__de__ These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
__de__ But still , now we have global warming .
__de__ If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
__de__ But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
__de__ So how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
__de__ Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
__de__ In Christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
__de__ In Fanning Island , the corals are not recovered .
__de__ But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
__de__ And the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
__de__ Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
__de__ And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
__de__ These places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
__de__ The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
__de__ And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
__de__ We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
__de__ So if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
__de__ Well , there are several ways .
__de__ One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
__de__ And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean .
__de__ This was my baseline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
__de__ And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
__de__ And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
__de__ But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
__de__ And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
__de__ After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
__de__ So you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
__de__ And this particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
__de__ So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
__de__ So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
__de__ These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
__de__ The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
__de__ This is very substantial .
__de__ The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
__de__ The abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
__de__ And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
__de__ In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
__de__ So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
__de__ They reproduce . That &apos;s population biology 101 .
__de__ If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
__de__ And same thing for invertebrates . This is the example .
__de__ These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
__de__ Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
__de__ One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
__de__ So these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
__de__ This is in the Bahamas : Nassau grouper .
__de__ Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
__de__ So the fishermen are catching more .
__de__ You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
__de__ So there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building resilience .
__de__ So what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
__de__ Reserves are like savings accounts .
__de__ We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
__de__ And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
__de__ Two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
__de__ This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a free-for-all .
__de__ Once the most degrading fishing gear , seine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
__de__ If you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
__de__ But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
__de__ Another example : Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef .
__de__ This is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
__de__ They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare , in one aggregation .
__de__ Fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
__de__ When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left .
__de__ And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
__de__ So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
__de__ And with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
__de__ It happened in many places around the Caribbean .
__de__ And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
__de__ Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
__de__ So how much of this do we have ?
__de__ If this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
__de__ And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
__de__ We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
__de__ Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
__de__ The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
__de__ Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
__de__ Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
__de__ Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
__de__ Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
__de__ People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
__de__ A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
__de__ So how can we do that ?
__de__ If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
__de__ And how can we reach that goal ?
__de__ Well , there are two ways of getting there .
__de__ The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago .
__de__ The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
__de__ And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
__de__ But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
__de__ Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
__de__ Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
__de__ It &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
__de__ Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
__de__ NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
__de__ So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
__de__ So the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
__de__ First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .
__de__ It &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
__de__ Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
__de__ And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
__de__ The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
__de__ We really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
__de__ And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
__de__ There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
__de__ The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
__de__ So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric .
__de__ Enric Sala : Thank you .
__de__ CA : That was a masterful job of pulling things together .
__de__ First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
__de__ How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
__de__ ES : Well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
__de__ The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
__de__ That &apos;s basically it .
__de__ The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
__de__ Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
__de__ They reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
__de__ So , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
__de__ They are like capacitors of the system .
__de__ CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
__de__ So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
__de__ ES : At least in the seas .
__de__ What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest .
__de__ And on land , this cannot work .
__de__ But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
__de__ We think this is universal .
__de__ But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
__de__ CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
__de__ You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
__de__ It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
__de__ If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
__de__ We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
__de__ ES : And then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
__de__ So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
__de__ CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
__de__ So thank you for those numbers .
__de__ The last one &apos;s a personal question .
__de__ A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
__de__ Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
__de__ ES : It is a spiritual experience .
__de__ We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
__de__ But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
__de__ And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
__de__ And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
__de__ It would be just too depressing .
__de__ CA : Well , Enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
__de__ ES : Thank you very much .
__de__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__de__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__de__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__de__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__de__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__de__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__de__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__de__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__de__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__de__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__de__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__de__ We get it in the abstract .
__de__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__de__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__de__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__de__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__de__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__de__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__de__ I think this is a problem .
__de__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__de__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__de__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__de__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__de__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__de__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__de__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__de__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__de__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__de__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__de__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__de__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__de__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__de__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__de__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__de__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__de__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__de__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__de__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__de__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__de__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__de__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__de__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__de__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__de__ I call this error blindness .
__de__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__de__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__de__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__de__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__de__ This is not mine , by the way .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__de__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__de__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__de__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__de__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__de__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__de__ Okay , so fine .
__de__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__de__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__de__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__de__ So let me tell you a story .
__de__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__de__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__de__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__de__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__de__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__de__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__de__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__de__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__de__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__de__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__de__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__de__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__de__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__de__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__de__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__de__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__de__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__de__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__de__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__de__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__de__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__de__ So this is a catastrophe .
__de__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__de__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__de__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__de__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__de__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__de__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__de__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__de__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__de__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__de__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__de__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__de__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__de__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__de__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__de__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__de__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__de__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__de__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__de__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__de__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__de__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__de__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__de__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__de__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__de__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__de__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__de__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__de__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__de__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__de__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__de__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__de__ And something else happened instead .
__de__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__de__ And something else happened instead .
__de__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__de__ And something else happened instead .
__de__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__de__ And something else happened instead .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__de__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__de__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__de__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__de__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__de__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__de__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__de__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__de__ We come up with another idea .
__de__ We tell another story .
__de__ We hold another conference .
__de__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__de__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__de__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__de__ On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
__de__ Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__de__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__de__ These were the men I looked up to .
__de__ These were the men I called ammu , which means uncle .
__de__ So what opened my eyes ?
__de__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
__de__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__de__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__de__ Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
__de__ I am not my father .
__de__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__de__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__de__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__de__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__de__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__de__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__de__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__de__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
__de__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__de__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__de__ It &apos;s tedious .
__de__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__de__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__de__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__de__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__de__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__de__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__de__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__de__ My idea is : no ! No !
__de__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__de__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__de__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__de__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__de__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__de__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__de__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__de__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__de__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__de__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__de__ They know .
__de__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__de__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__de__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__de__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__de__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__de__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__de__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__de__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__de__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__de__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__de__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
__de__ I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
__de__ Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
__de__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__de__ This is a Klein bottle .
__de__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
__de__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__de__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
__de__ It has wonderful properties .
__de__ If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__de__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__de__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
__de__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__de__ This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__de__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__de__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__de__ That was a month of my life .
__de__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__de__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__de__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__de__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__de__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__de__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
__de__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__de__ And it sent me back .
__de__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__de__ This guy over here of course is me .
__de__ This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__de__ Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__de__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
__de__ He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__de__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__de__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__de__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__de__ In the background , my bicycle .
__de__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__de__ Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
__de__ We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__de__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__de__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
__de__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
__de__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__de__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__de__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__de__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__de__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__de__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__de__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
__de__ I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
__de__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__de__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
__de__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__de__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__de__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
__de__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__de__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__de__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__de__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
__de__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__de__ You won &apos;t need to know trig .
__de__ But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__de__ None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
__de__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__de__ ( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__de__ My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
__de__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__de__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__de__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__de__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__de__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__de__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__de__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__de__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__de__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__de__ But , probably — one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__de__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__de__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__de__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__de__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__de__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__de__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__de__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__de__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__de__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__de__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__de__ It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
__de__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__de__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__de__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__de__ The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__de__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__de__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__de__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__de__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__de__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__de__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
__de__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
__de__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__de__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
__de__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
__de__ But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__de__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__de__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__de__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
__de__ I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__de__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
__de__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__de__ I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__de__ Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
__de__ And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
__de__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__de__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__de__ He wants to clunk me over the head !
__de__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
__de__ It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
__de__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__de__ Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__de__ Chases me into this room .
__de__ The entranceway to the bell tower .
__de__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__de__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__de__ I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
__de__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__de__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__de__ I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
__de__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__de__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
__de__ A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
__de__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__de__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__de__ Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
__de__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__de__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__de__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__de__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__de__ A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
__de__ And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
__de__ In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
__de__ So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
__de__ I thought about calling a locksmith — at least I had my cellphone , but at midnight , it could take a while for a locksmith to show up , and it was cold .
__de__ I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase .
__de__ So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it .
__de__ This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even .
__de__ Now , I &apos;m a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress .
__de__ It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate , it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking .
__de__ So the next morning , when I woke up on too little sleep , worrying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contractor , and the freezing temperatures , and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cortisol in my brain , my thinking was cloudy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport check-in counter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my passport . ( Laughter )
__de__ So I raced home in the snow and ice , 40 minutes , got my passport , raced back to the airport , I made it just in time , but they had given away my seat to someone else , so I got stuck in the back of the plane , next to the bathrooms , in a seat that wouldn &apos;t recline , on an eight-hour flight .
__de__ Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
__de__ Now , you all know what the postmortem is .
__de__ Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage .
__de__ So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem .
__de__ Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
__de__ I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
__de__ Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
__de__ Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
__de__ There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
__de__ It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
__de__ And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels , and they could still find their nuts .
__de__ They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
__de__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__de__ So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
__de__ So in the home , designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
__de__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__de__ For your reading glasses , a particular table .
__de__ If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
__de__ What about travel ?
__de__ Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
__de__ Now these are some rather obvious things .
__de__ Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
__de__ Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
__de__ So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
__de__ And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .
__de__ And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
__de__ But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , and social decision-making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts .
__de__ So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
__de__ Now , you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
__de__ It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
__de__ Now , what is this , the NNT ?
__de__ It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
__de__ And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that ?
__de__ The number should be one .
__de__ But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
__de__ And it &apos;s not the doctor &apos;s fault , if it &apos;s anybody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s the fault of scientists like me .
__de__ But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
__de__ So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
__de__ How many people have to take it before one person is helped ?
__de__ I ran through the numbers myself .
__de__ 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack , stroke or other adverse event is prevented .
__de__ Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol .
__de__ Why not , doc ? Give me the prescription anyway . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another statistic , and that is , &quot; &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__de__ So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
__de__ You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
__de__ I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
__de__ You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not .
__de__ For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 .
__de__ That &apos;s right , 49 surgeries are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
__de__ And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
__de__ They include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
__de__ And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
__de__ And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
__de__ Because you have a choice oftentimes , do you I want a shorter life that &apos;s pain-free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end ?
__de__ There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
__de__ Face-to-face with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if you &apos;re body is expending metabolism on those things and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s lunch , and then none of those things matter .
__de__ Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
__de__ So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
__de__ I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
__de__ We all are going to fail now and then .
__de__ The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
__de__ And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Good morning !
__de__ Are you awake ?
__de__ They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
__de__ Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
__de__ Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
__de__ So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
__de__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
__de__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__de__ He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
__de__ What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
__de__ Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
__de__ How could she speak that way ?
__de__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__de__ It made me mad .
__de__ It definitely hurts !
__de__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__de__ Where could this happen ?
__de__ How did we get here ?
__de__ Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
__de__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__de__ Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
__de__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
__de__ To be one of them ?
__de__ Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
__de__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__de__ I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
__de__ The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
__de__ It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
__de__ If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
__de__ Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
__de__ So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
__de__ This is one reality .
__de__ But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
__de__ Arabic is the mother tongue .
__de__ Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
__de__ Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
__de__ Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
__de__ All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
__de__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
__de__ Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
__de__ You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
__de__ So , this is an example no one can argue with .
__de__ Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
__de__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__de__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__de__ They make it sacred .
__de__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__de__ All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
__de__ Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
__de__ They kept it close to them .
__de__ Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
__de__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__de__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__de__ So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
__de__ Regardless of the who , how and why .
__de__ Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__de__ So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
__de__ Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
__de__ It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
__de__ What is our intellect ?
__de__ How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
__de__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__de__ How would you feel ?
__de__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__de__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__de__ I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__de__ I asked her once how things were going .
__de__ She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; toqborni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; &quot; toqborni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
__de__ He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
__de__ Does she want to commit suicide ?
__de__ &apos;Bury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
__de__ It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
__de__ Translate that for me .
__de__ ( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
__de__ We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
__de__ Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
__de__ The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
__de__ We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
__de__ And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
__de__ We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
__de__ So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
__de__ Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
__de__ After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
__de__ You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
__de__ Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
__de__ We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
__de__ If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
__de__ We &apos;d have to find an existence .
__de__ We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
__de__ This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
__de__ We are very cool !
__de__ And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
__de__ I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
__de__ But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
__de__ Creativity is the idea .
__de__ So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
__de__ At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
__de__ Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
__de__ Let &apos;s start from this moment .
__de__ Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
__de__ A single novel could make us global again .
__de__ It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
__de__ So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
__de__ But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
__de__ In conclusion , what can you do today ?
__de__ Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
__de__ Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
__de__ But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
__de__ You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
__de__ It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
__de__ Second , there are many other things that we can do .
__de__ We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
__de__ We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
__de__ A baby first identifies its father through language .
__de__ ( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe . ( Applause )
__de__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__de__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__de__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__de__ I want to know how I impact them .
__de__ I want to know how they impact me .
__de__ I want to know why they fish .
__de__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__de__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__de__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__de__ So what do we call this ?
__de__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__de__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
__de__ Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
__de__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__de__ Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__de__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__de__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__de__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__de__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__de__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__de__ You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__de__ Pole caught — no bycatch .
__de__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
__de__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__de__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__de__ Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
__de__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__de__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__de__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__de__ Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
__de__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__de__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__de__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__de__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__de__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__de__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__de__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
__de__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__de__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__de__ Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant .
__de__ Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
__de__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__de__ Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__de__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__de__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__de__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
__de__ It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
__de__ Whooo !
__de__ This is an easy sell .
__de__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__de__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__de__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__de__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__de__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__de__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
__de__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__de__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__de__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__de__ So let &apos;s start there .
__de__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__de__ Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
__de__ But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
__de__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
__de__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__de__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__de__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__de__ Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__de__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood .
__de__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__de__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__de__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__de__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__de__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__de__ A couple things happened .
__de__ I made more money .
__de__ People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
__de__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__de__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__de__ They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
__de__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__de__ This is great .
__de__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__de__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
__de__ Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
__de__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__de__ This is what we need to favor .
__de__ This is what the green list says .
__de__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__de__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__de__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__de__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__de__ Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
__de__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__de__ Put it on four plates .
__de__ Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__de__ Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__de__ Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__de__ I expect a lot from food .
__de__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__de__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
__de__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__de__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__de__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__de__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__de__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__de__ I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
__de__ I get the meat sweats .
__de__ It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
__de__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__de__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__de__ Eat your vegetables .
__de__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__de__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__de__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
__de__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
__de__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
__de__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__de__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__de__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__de__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__de__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
__de__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__de__ We need to savor vegetables .
__de__ We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
__de__ And we need to save dinner .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Hi . I am an architect .
__de__ I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
__de__ 1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
__de__ It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
__de__ Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
__de__ This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
__de__ There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
__de__ As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
__de__ In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
__de__ Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
__de__ I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
__de__ So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
__de__ My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
__de__ My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
__de__ After , the building was recycled .
__de__ So that was the goal of my design .
__de__ Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
__de__ Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
__de__ So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
__de__ We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
__de__ Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
__de__ That was the problem .
__de__ Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
__de__ It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
__de__ But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
__de__ They have money and power .
__de__ Those are invisible .
__de__ So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
__de__ That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
__de__ So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
__de__ But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
__de__ For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
__de__ That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
__de__ Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
__de__ So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
__de__ We can make it better .
__de__ So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
__de__ 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
__de__ Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
__de__ Over two million people became refugees .
__de__ But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
__de__ They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
__de__ But over two million people cut trees .
__de__ It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
__de__ That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
__de__ Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
__de__ So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
__de__ We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
__de__ And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
__de__ Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
__de__ And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
__de__ So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
__de__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
__de__ After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
__de__ I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
__de__ They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
__de__ So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
__de__ I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
__de__ I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
__de__ The color coordination is very important .
__de__ And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
__de__ So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
__de__ Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
__de__ It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
__de__ Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
__de__ It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
__de__ So this building became a permanent building .
__de__ Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
__de__ Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
__de__ Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
__de__ In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
__de__ 2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
__de__ In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
__de__ And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
__de__ I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
__de__ I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
__de__ In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
__de__ It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
__de__ In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
__de__ And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
__de__ And they are very kind , affording my model .
__de__ I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
__de__ So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
__de__ Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
__de__ Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
__de__ This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
__de__ After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
__de__ But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
__de__ People suffer mentally and physically .
__de__ So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
__de__ However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
__de__ But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
__de__ They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
__de__ Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
__de__ So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
__de__ Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
__de__ He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
__de__ I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
__de__ Many of the people want to stay here forever .
__de__ I was very happy to hear that .
__de__ Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
__de__ About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
__de__ And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
__de__ So this is under construction .
__de__ And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__de__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__de__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__de__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
__de__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__de__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__de__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__de__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__de__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__de__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__de__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__de__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__de__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
__de__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__de__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__de__ What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
__de__ Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__de__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__de__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__de__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
__de__ I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
__de__ I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__de__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__de__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__de__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__de__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__de__ On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__de__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__de__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__de__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__de__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__de__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__de__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__de__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__de__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__de__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__de__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
__de__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__de__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__de__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__de__ And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
__de__ On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
__de__ And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__de__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__de__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__de__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__de__ And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__de__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__de__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
__de__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__de__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__de__ So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__de__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__de__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__de__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__de__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
__de__ Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__de__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
__de__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__de__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__de__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__de__ My son is 23 .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__de__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__de__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__de__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__de__ So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__de__ You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
__de__ And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__de__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__de__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__de__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__de__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__de__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__de__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__de__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
__de__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__de__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__de__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__de__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__de__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__de__ And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__de__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__de__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__de__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__de__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__de__ And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__de__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__de__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__de__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__de__ This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
__de__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
__de__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__de__ Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__de__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__de__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
__de__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__de__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__de__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
__de__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__de__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__de__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__de__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__de__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__de__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__de__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__de__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__de__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__de__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__de__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__de__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__de__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__de__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__de__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__de__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__de__ Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
__de__ What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
__de__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__de__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__de__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__de__ Same as the other side .
__de__ Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__de__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__de__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__de__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__de__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__de__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__de__ Oh .
__de__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__de__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__de__ Not working either .
__de__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__de__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__de__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__de__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__de__ So when you put four .
__de__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__de__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__de__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__de__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__de__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__de__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__de__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__de__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__de__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__de__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__de__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__de__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__de__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__de__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__de__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__de__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__de__ So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
__de__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__de__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__de__ So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
__de__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__de__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__de__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__de__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__de__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__de__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__de__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
__de__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__de__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__de__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
__de__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__de__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__de__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__de__ It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__de__ We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
__de__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__de__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__de__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__de__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__de__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__de__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__de__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__de__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__de__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__de__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__de__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__de__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__de__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__de__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__de__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__de__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__de__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__de__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__de__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__de__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__de__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__de__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__de__ They work in the field .
__de__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__de__ They have education programs .
__de__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__de__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__de__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__de__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__de__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__de__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__de__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__de__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__de__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__de__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__de__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__de__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__de__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__de__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__de__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__de__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__de__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__de__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__de__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__de__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__de__ This can happen .
__de__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__de__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__de__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__de__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__de__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__de__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__de__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__de__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__de__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__de__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__de__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__de__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__de__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__de__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__de__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__de__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__de__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__de__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__de__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__de__ This is the transformation that took place .
__de__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__de__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__de__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__de__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__de__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__de__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__de__ The rocket was huge .
__de__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__de__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__de__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__de__ In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__de__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__de__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__de__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__de__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__de__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__de__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__de__ All hell broke loose .
__de__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__de__ It provoked the missile gap .
__de__ It exploded an arms race .
__de__ It began the space race .
__de__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__de__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__de__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__de__ Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__de__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__de__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__de__ Support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
__de__ And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__de__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
__de__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__de__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
__de__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__de__ ( Applause ) .
__de__ Thank you , Chris .

__de__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__de__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__de__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__de__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__de__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__de__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__de__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__de__ Let me show you what I mean .
__de__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__de__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__de__ All right . Very significant mark .
__de__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__de__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__de__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__de__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__de__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__de__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__de__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__de__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__de__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__de__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__de__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__de__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__de__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__de__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__de__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__de__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__de__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__de__ Wake up .
__de__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__de__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__de__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__de__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__de__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__de__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__de__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__de__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__de__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__de__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__de__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__de__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__de__ The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
__de__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__de__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__de__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
__de__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__de__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
__de__ And the third is a little bit less obvious .
__de__ Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
__de__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__de__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__de__ I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
__de__ My brothers and I dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
__de__ He was livid , and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
__de__ Later , I understood why my father got so upset .
__de__ Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
__de__ My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
__de__ His was a lonely struggle , because Bihar was also India &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
__de__ And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
__de__ And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was famished and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
__de__ Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
__de__ This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
__de__ I resolved to give back .
__de__ Later , I joined the World Bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
__de__ My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
__de__ But after we disbursed the loans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
__de__ It was Bihar all over again .
__de__ Bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
__de__ Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
__de__ And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
__de__ Second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
__de__ And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
__de__ Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
__de__ Open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__de__ The first key shift is open knowledge .
__de__ You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
__de__ They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
__de__ They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
__de__ This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades today inspiring New York City .
__de__ And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
__de__ This is the second shift : open aid .
__de__ Recently , the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
__de__ Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
__de__ Take GeoMapping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
__de__ So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
__de__ In this manner , the World Bank has now GeoMapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
__de__ This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
__de__ And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
__de__ From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
__de__ Are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
__de__ So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
__de__ But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
__de__ This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
__de__ To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
__de__ In this map from Moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
__de__ Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
__de__ So in the Philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__de__ And the government is responsive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action .
__de__ And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
__de__ In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
__de__ This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
__de__ And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
__de__ Today , even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
__de__ But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
__de__ These are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
__de__ So for instance , today , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
__de__ These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar .
__de__ Two years ago , on April 8th , 2010 , I called my father .
__de__ It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
__de__ Though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . He won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
__de__ He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
__de__ These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
__de__ Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
__de__ We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
__de__ We need to accelerate these shifts .
__de__ If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , in Uganda , and beyond .
__de__ We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
__de__ We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
__de__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__de__ It stops babies from dying .
__de__ So now just take a minute .
__de__ I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
__de__ Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
__de__ Please shake their hands .
__de__ All right , get to know each other .
__de__ They look really pretty .
__de__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__de__ Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
__de__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__de__ Actually , soap is available .
__de__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__de__ Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
__de__ So why is it ?
__de__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__de__ Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__de__ Well , in Mayank &apos;s family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
__de__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__de__ Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
__de__ Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
__de__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__de__ However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
__de__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__de__ Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__de__ The budget is not always there .
__de__ In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap .
__de__ Win for the private sector , because we build new generations of future handwashers .
__de__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__de__ Most of these discussions are still happening online .
__de__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__de__ I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
__de__ I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
__de__ We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
__de__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__de__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__de__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__de__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__de__ This one is from Myanmar .
__de__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__de__ Her son , Myo , is her second one .
__de__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__de__ I hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like Myo reach their fifth birthday .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
__de__ They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
__de__ Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
__de__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__de__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__de__ The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__de__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__de__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__de__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__de__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__de__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__de__ Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
__de__ Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
__de__ These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
__de__ Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
__de__ Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
__de__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__de__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__de__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__de__ And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
__de__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__de__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__de__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__de__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
__de__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__de__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__de__ It &apos;s awful .
__de__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__de__ Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
__de__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__de__ So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
__de__ A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__de__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__de__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__de__ And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
__de__ This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
__de__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__de__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__de__ That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
__de__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__de__ And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
__de__ So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
__de__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__de__ One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
__de__ And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
__de__ So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
__de__ So here &apos;s a video .
__de__ You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
__de__ But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
__de__ That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
__de__ The next work is Decoy .
__de__ This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
__de__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__de__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__de__ So here is the first test scenario .
__de__ You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
__de__ But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
__de__ It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__de__ Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
__de__ And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
__de__ The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
__de__ In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
__de__ Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
__de__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__de__ So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
__de__ It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
__de__ So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
__de__ So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
__de__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
__de__ It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
__de__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__de__ So here &apos;s a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
__de__ And here is a prototype .
__de__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
__de__ Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
__de__ It comes out of the idea of a window .
__de__ This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
__de__ So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
__de__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__de__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__de__ Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
__de__ So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
__de__ So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they &apos;re oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
__de__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__de__ These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
__de__ So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
__de__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__de__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__de__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ This is how the year would go .
__de__ But then , the funniest thing happened .
__de__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__de__ Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
__de__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__de__ That &apos;s why there &apos;s an overlap .
__de__ I call it the Dark Playground .
__de__ And guess who woke up ?
__de__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__de__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastinators .
__de__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__de__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__de__ We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey .
__de__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__de__ Sometime soon .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
__de__ The column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
__de__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
__de__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__de__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__de__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__de__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__de__ You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
__de__ In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
__de__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__de__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__de__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__de__ So trust and cooperation are really important here .
__de__ The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
__de__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__de__ I can &apos;t simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
__de__ It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
__de__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__de__ If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
__de__ Nothing personal .
__de__ Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
__de__ And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
__de__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__de__ There are inherent benefits to this .
__de__ It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
__de__ Bad system of survival .
__de__ It could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
__de__ It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
__de__ Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
__de__ It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
__de__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__de__ So I said something .
__de__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__de__ Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
__de__ She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
__de__ she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
__de__ The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
__de__ You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weakens the organization .
__de__ The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
__de__ If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
__de__ We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
__de__ Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
__de__ They want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipline when necessary , build their self-confidence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
__de__ Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
__de__ We would never do it .
__de__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__de__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__de__ If you get a job at Next Jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
__de__ In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
__de__ This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
__de__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__de__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__de__ We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
__de__ Would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to Gandhi ?
__de__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
__de__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__de__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__de__ the people to save the numbers .
__de__ They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
__de__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__de__ They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed layoffs .
__de__ And Bob refused .
__de__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__de__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__de__ And so they came up with a furlough program .
__de__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
__de__ They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
__de__ But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much .
__de__ They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
__de__ And quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
__de__ Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
__de__ They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
__de__ I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
__de__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__de__ We call them leaders because they go first .
__de__ We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
__de__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__de__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__de__ And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
__de__ Thank you very much .
__de__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
__de__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
__de__ The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
__de__ So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__de__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__de__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__de__ Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
__de__ Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
__de__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
__de__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__de__ and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
__de__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__de__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__de__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
__de__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__de__ So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
__de__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__de__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__de__ So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
__de__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__de__ And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
__de__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__de__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__de__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__de__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
__de__ DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
__de__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__de__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__de__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__de__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause . )
__de__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__de__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__de__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__de__ I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
__de__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__de__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__de__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__de__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__de__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__de__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__de__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__de__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__de__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__de__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__de__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__de__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__de__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__de__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__de__ You see that glass of water ?
__de__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__de__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__de__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__de__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__de__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__de__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__de__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__de__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__de__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__de__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__de__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__de__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__de__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__de__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__de__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__de__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__de__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__de__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__de__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__de__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__de__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__de__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__de__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__de__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__de__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__de__ The light never goes out .
__de__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__de__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__de__ Or is it photography ?
__de__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__de__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__de__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__de__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__de__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__de__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__de__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__de__ Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__de__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__de__ And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
__de__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__de__ When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
__de__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__de__ Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__de__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__de__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__de__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__de__ Is it something about the light ?
__de__ What creates the illusion ?
__de__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__de__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__de__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__de__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__de__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__de__ And let me show you a simple example .
__de__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__de__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__de__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__de__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__de__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__de__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__de__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__de__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__de__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__de__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__de__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__de__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__de__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__de__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__de__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__de__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__de__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__de__ So here &apos;s another example .
__de__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__de__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__de__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__de__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__de__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__de__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__de__ The shores are from a different location .
__de__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__de__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__de__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__de__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__de__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__de__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__de__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__de__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__de__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__de__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__de__ Can that possibly be true ?
__de__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__de__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__de__ CA : How does it work ?
__de__ How do people release the documents ?
__de__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__de__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__de__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__de__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__de__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__de__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__de__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__de__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__de__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__de__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__de__ If we can have this document up ...
__de__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__de__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__de__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__de__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__de__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__de__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__de__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__de__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__de__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__de__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__de__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__de__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__de__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__de__ And so it came in from the outside .
__de__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__de__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__de__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__de__ JA : Yep .
__de__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__de__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__de__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__de__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__de__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__de__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__de__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__de__ Light &apos; em all up .
__de__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__de__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__de__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__de__ we need to move , time now !
__de__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__de__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__de__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__de__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__de__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__de__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__de__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__de__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__de__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__de__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__de__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__de__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__de__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__de__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__de__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__de__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__de__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__de__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__de__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__de__ I mean , did he ?
__de__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__de__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__de__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__de__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__de__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__de__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__de__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__de__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__de__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__de__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__de__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__de__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__de__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__de__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__de__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__de__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__de__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__de__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__de__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__de__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__de__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__de__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__de__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__de__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__de__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__de__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__de__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__de__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__de__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__de__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__de__ Light is good .
__de__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__de__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__de__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__de__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__de__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__de__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__de__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__de__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__de__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__de__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__de__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__de__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__de__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__de__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__de__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__de__ What is this ?
__de__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__de__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__de__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__de__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__de__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__de__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__de__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__de__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__de__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__de__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__de__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__de__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__de__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__de__ Yeah .
__de__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__de__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__de__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__de__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__de__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__de__ That &apos;s a problem .
__de__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__de__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__de__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__de__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__de__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__de__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__de__ Can that be right ?
__de__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__de__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__de__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__de__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__de__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__de__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__de__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__de__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__de__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__de__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__de__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__de__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__de__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__de__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__de__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__de__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__de__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__de__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__de__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__de__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__de__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__de__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__de__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__de__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__de__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__de__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__de__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__de__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__de__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__de__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__de__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__de__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__de__ CA : Wow .
__de__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__de__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__de__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__de__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__de__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__de__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__de__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__de__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__de__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__de__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__de__ I will not dance to that beating .
__de__ I know that beat .
__de__ It is lifeless .
__de__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__de__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__de__ I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
__de__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__de__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__de__ I will not kill for you .
__de__ Especially I will not die for you .
__de__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__de__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__de__ Everyone can be wrong .
__de__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__de__ I will not forget where I come from .
__de__ I will craft my own drum .
__de__ Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
__de__ Our humming will be drumming .
__de__ I will not be played .
__de__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__de__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__de__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__de__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
__de__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__de__ ( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
__de__ Confused , aspiring pacifists .
__de__ I understand .
__de__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__de__ Like a lot .
__de__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__de__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
__de__ What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__de__ Poetry does that .
__de__ It preps you . It aims you .
__de__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__de__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__de__ Hold her now with you .
__de__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__de__ Are you holding her ?
__de__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__de__ Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
__de__ But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__de__ Whose son shall it be ?
__de__ Which male child will perish a new day ?
__de__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
__de__ We cherish corpses .
__de__ We mourn women , complicated .
__de__ Bitches get beat daily .
__de__ Profits made , prophets ignored .
__de__ War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
__de__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__de__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__de__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__de__ Rhythm is half silence .
__de__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__de__ Sickness , health , tender violence .
__de__ I think now I never was pure .
__de__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am .
__de__ Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
__de__ I never was pure .
__de__ Girl spoiled before ripened .
__de__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__de__ I experience exponentially .
__de__ Everything is everything .
__de__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__de__ One woman loses six .
__de__ One woman loses her head .
__de__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__de__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__de__ One woman straps herself .
__de__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__de__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__de__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__de__ One woman never did .
__de__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__de__ Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__de__ Faced with absence .
__de__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
__de__ My spine curves spiral .
__de__ Precipice running to and running from human beings .
__de__ Cluster bombs left behind .
__de__ De facto landmines .
__de__ A smoldering grief .
__de__ Harvest contaminated tobacco .
__de__ Harvest bombs .
__de__ Harvest baby teeth .
__de__ Harvest palms , smoke .
__de__ Harvest witness , smoke .
__de__ Resolutions , smoke .
__de__ Salvation , smoke .
__de__ Redemption , smoke .
__de__ Breathe .
__de__ Do not fear what has blown up .
__de__ If you must , fear the unexploded .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__de__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__de__ Global famine was inevitable .
__de__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
__de__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__de__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__de__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__de__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__de__ Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__de__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__de__ Per-capita food production is up by a third .
__de__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__de__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__de__ How did we achieve that ?
__de__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
__de__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__de__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__de__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__de__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__de__ These are both real objects .
__de__ One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__de__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__de__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__de__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__de__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__de__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__de__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__de__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__de__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__de__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__de__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__de__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__de__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__de__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__de__ The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__de__ And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__de__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__de__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__de__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__de__ They &apos;ve come together .
__de__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__de__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__de__ In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__de__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__de__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
__de__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__de__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__de__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__de__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__de__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__de__ No other animal does it .
__de__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__de__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__de__ You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
__de__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__de__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__de__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__de__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__de__ Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__de__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__de__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__de__ Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
__de__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__de__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__de__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__de__ So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
__de__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__de__ He can make his own spears and axes .
__de__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__de__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
__de__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__de__ And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__de__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__de__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__de__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__de__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__de__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__de__ You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
__de__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__de__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__de__ And the answer is about half a second .
__de__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__de__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__de__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__de__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__de__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__de__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__de__ It was self-sufficiency .
__de__ We call that poverty these days .
__de__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__de__ How many other people ?
__de__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__de__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__de__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__de__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__de__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__de__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__de__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__de__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__de__ Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
__de__ They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
__de__ He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__de__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__de__ They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
__de__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__de__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__de__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__de__ Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__de__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__de__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__de__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__de__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__de__ The queen does it all .
__de__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__de__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__de__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__de__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__de__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__de__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__de__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__de__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__de__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__de__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__de__ The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__de__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
__de__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__de__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__de__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__de__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__de__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__de__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__de__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__de__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__de__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__de__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__de__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
__de__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__de__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__de__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__de__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__de__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__de__ They &apos;re always made from local chert .
__de__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
__de__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__de__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__de__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__de__ Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__de__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__de__ You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__de__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__de__ And that will have led to specialization .
__de__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__de__ Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
__de__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__de__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__de__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__de__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__de__ An example is Tasmania .
__de__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
__de__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__de__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
__de__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__de__ It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
__de__ The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__de__ The Tasmanians were isolated .
__de__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__de__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__de__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__de__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__de__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__de__ I mean this quite seriously .
__de__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__de__ He just knows how to run a company .
__de__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__de__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__de__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__de__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__de__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__de__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__de__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__de__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__de__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
__de__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__de__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__de__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__de__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__de__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__de__ It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__de__ However , bad things happen .
__de__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__de__ There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
__de__ Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__de__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__de__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ My name is Uldus .
__de__ I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
__de__ I focus on balancing meaningful message , aesthetic , beauty , composition , some irony , and artifacts .
__de__ Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , which is named Desperate Romantics .
__de__ But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Russia .
__de__ Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
__de__ And this is Nikita , a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg .
__de__ He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting Hulk from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
__de__ He hides his sensitivities and romantic side , because in Russia , among guys , that &apos;s not cool to be romantic , but it &apos;s cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
__de__ Sometimes , I would compare facial features and playing with words : irony , Iron Man , ironing man .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation .
__de__ Interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
__de__ We &apos;re taught from childhood , successful marriage means successful life , so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband .
__de__ And what about me ?
__de__ I &apos;m 27 years old .
__de__ For Russian society , I &apos;m an old maid and hopeless to ever get married .
__de__ That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask , in the wedding dress , all desperate in my garden .
__de__ But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stereotypes .
__de__ Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
__de__ Be funny and create some magic .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ My name is Amit .
__de__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__de__ And it took 18 months .
__de__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__de__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__de__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__de__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__de__ And I grew up in India .
__de__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__de__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__de__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__de__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__de__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__de__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__de__ You look around at all these museums here .
__de__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__de__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__de__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__de__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__de__ You move around , you have fun .
__de__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__de__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__de__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__de__ Keep going . Have fun .
__de__ Explore .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__de__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__de__ I see this plus sign .
__de__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__de__ Now this is one of the images .
__de__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__de__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__de__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__de__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__de__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__de__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__de__ You can zoom around very simply .
__de__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__de__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__de__ But then you really want to go deep .
__de__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__de__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__de__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__de__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__de__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__de__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__de__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__de__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__de__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__de__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__de__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__de__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__de__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__de__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__de__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__de__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__de__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__de__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__de__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__de__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__de__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__de__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__de__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__de__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__de__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__de__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__de__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__de__ It really comes from these artists .
__de__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__de__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__de__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__de__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__de__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__de__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
__de__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
__de__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__de__ I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
__de__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__de__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__de__ Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual .
__de__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
__de__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
__de__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
__de__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__de__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
__de__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
__de__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
__de__ Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
__de__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__de__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
__de__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__de__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__de__ It will dry up inside .
__de__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__de__ We all do .
__de__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__de__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__de__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
__de__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__de__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__de__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__de__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__de__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__de__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__de__ In my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__de__ Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__de__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__de__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__de__ My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__de__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
__de__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__de__ I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__de__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__de__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__de__ And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
__de__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__de__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__de__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__de__ My mother became a diplomat .
__de__ So from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__de__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreigner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__de__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__de__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__de__ The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
__de__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
__de__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__de__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__de__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__de__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
__de__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__de__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__de__ In my mid-twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__de__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__de__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__de__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__de__ There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
__de__ He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
__de__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
__de__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__de__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__de__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__de__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__de__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__de__ I started writing fiction in English .
__de__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__de__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__de__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__de__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__de__ When you &apos;re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__de__ As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__de__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__de__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__de__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__de__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__de__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__de__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__de__ I guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
__de__ Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__de__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__de__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__de__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__de__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__de__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__de__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__de__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__de__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__de__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
__de__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more heavily .
__de__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__de__ You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
__de__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .
__de__ Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__de__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__de__ The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__de__ When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__de__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
__de__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__de__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__de__ It was only because of our passports .
__de__ Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__de__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__de__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__de__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__de__ It comes from everywhere .
__de__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
__de__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__de__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__de__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict .
__de__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__de__ It was just a story .
__de__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
__de__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__de__ Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__de__ Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__de__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
__de__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__de__ The other , in nuances .
__de__ One draws boundaries .
__de__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__de__ Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
__de__ Fiction is flowing water .
__de__ In the Ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__de__ With each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
__de__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
__de__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__de__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__de__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
__de__ Literature has to take us beyond .
__de__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__de__ Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was — that I once was .
__de__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
__de__ When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__de__ The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
__de__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__de__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__de__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__de__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__de__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__de__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__de__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace , which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
__de__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
__de__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__de__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__de__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__de__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
__de__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__de__ When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
__de__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__de__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__de__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__de__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__de__ Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__de__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__de__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__de__ Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__de__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__de__ We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
__de__ In the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__de__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__de__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
__de__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__de__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
__de__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__de__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
__de__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__de__ Five million people use it every month .
__de__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__de__ His work is brilliant .
__de__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__de__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__de__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
__de__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__de__ This is really exciting .
__de__ According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__de__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__de__ We made this game in 2007 .
__de__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__de__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
__de__ The &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
__de__ It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Rockies .
__de__ And the job in question was sheep rancher .
__de__ My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
__de__ I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
__de__ And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
__de__ The job in question : herding sheep . Great .
__de__ We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
__de__ So , normally , I never do any research at all .
__de__ But , this is a touchy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
__de__ So I called the Humane Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
__de__ This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
__de__ And then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
__de__ Blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
__de__ &quot; Great — got it . &quot;
__de__ OK , I call the SPCA to confirm this — they confirm it .
__de__ I also call PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confirm it .
__de__ OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
__de__ So the next day I go out .
__de__ And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
__de__ Melanie is the wife of Albert .
__de__ Albert is the shepherd in question .
__de__ Melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
__de__ Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
__de__ Alright . Great .
__de__ Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
__de__ I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
__de__ Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
__de__ Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
__de__ And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
__de__ And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
__de__ In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
__de__ A second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
__de__ And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
__de__ Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
__de__ He snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what I hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
__de__ Can we roll the video ?
__de__ No I &apos;m kidding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
__de__ So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
__de__ I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
__de__ There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scripting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
__de__ We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse — we shoot what we get !
__de__ I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
__de__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
__de__ We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Humane Society ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Humane Society .
__de__ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb squeal and bleed — we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
__de__ We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
__de__ Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
__de__ Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
__de__ I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
__de__ Gets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s quivering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
__de__ And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
__de__ When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
__de__ Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
__de__ He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
__de__ And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
__de__ And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German porno , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
__de__ Albert hands me the knife .
__de__ I go in , tail comes off .
__de__ I go in , I grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
__de__ Albert instructs , &quot; &quot; Push it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
__de__ &quot; Push it further . &quot;
__de__ I do .
__de__ The testicles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; Bite &apos; em .
__de__ Just bite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
__de__ How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rockies , and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
__de__ You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jacked-up metaphor ?
__de__ I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
__de__ I went in and I took them .
__de__ I took them like this , and I yanked my face back .
__de__ And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
__de__ OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Poetics , &quot; &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
__de__ And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__de__ Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__de__ Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
__de__ Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
__de__ It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; is .
__de__ And I &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
__de__ Great .
__de__ The other word , peripeteia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know — Euripides and Sophocles — the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
__de__ That &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
__de__ And this metaphor in my head — I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
__de__ ( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
__de__ When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
__de__ I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
__de__ Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peripetia .
__de__ You know ?
__de__ It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
__de__ Neo in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
__de__ &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
__de__ These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
__de__ And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK .
__de__ Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
__de__ Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
__de__ And I talk to him .
__de__ ( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
__de__ Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
__de__ You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
__de__ You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
__de__ I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
__de__ &quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
__de__ Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
__de__ And , after that shoot , Dirty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
__de__ And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
__de__ I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
__de__ People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
__de__ As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
__de__ And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
__de__ I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
__de__ Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God — I did it with them .
__de__ They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
__de__ And I see it over and over and over again .
__de__ So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
__de__ Follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
__de__ Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
__de__ Probably the worst advice I ever got .
__de__ ( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
__de__ I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
__de__ I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
__de__ I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
__de__ Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
__de__ He &apos;s making a great living .
__de__ You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
__de__ The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
__de__ He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
__de__ He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
__de__ And I hear that story over and over .
__de__ Matt Froind , a dairy farmer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
__de__ Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
__de__ Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
__de__ So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
__de__ I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call &quot; &quot; successories &quot; &quot; that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now .
__de__ That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
__de__ Safety — safety first ?
__de__ Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
__de__ I mean — this is heresy , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
__de__ Right ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
__de__ What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
__de__ They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
__de__ And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; &quot; Deadliest Catch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
__de__ We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
__de__ Most hazardous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
__de__ So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
__de__ Unspeakably dangerous .
__de__ I scamper down , I go into the wheelhouse and I say , with some level of incredulity , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
__de__ And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
__de__ It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
__de__ But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
__de__ My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
__de__ My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
__de__ And for the rest of that day , safety first .
__de__ I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
__de__ Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
__de__ I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
__de__ But , what it all comes down to is this .
__de__ I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
__de__ It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
__de__ It &apos;s a civil war .
__de__ It &apos;s a cold war , really .
__de__ We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
__de__ And we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
__de__ The way we portray working people on TV — it &apos;s laughable .
__de__ If there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Admit it .
__de__ You see him all the time .
__de__ That &apos;s what plumbers look like , right ?
__de__ We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
__de__ That &apos;s what TV does .
__de__ We try hard on &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
__de__ But , we &apos;ve waged this war on Madison Avenue .
__de__ I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
__de__ Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
__de__ Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
__de__ I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
__de__ And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
__de__ How many people have their Blackberries ?
__de__ We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
__de__ I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
__de__ Good grief , not to this crowd .
__de__ ( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
__de__ And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
__de__ Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
__de__ All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
__de__ So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
__de__ Our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
__de__ They look like the stuff we walk around with .
__de__ And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
__de__ And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
__de__ And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
__de__ I got a lot wrong .
__de__ So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
__de__ Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
__de__ I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
__de__ Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
__de__ The infrastructure is a huge deal .
__de__ This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
__de__ The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
__de__ Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
__de__ The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
__de__ Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
__de__ So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
__de__ And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
__de__ They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
__de__ It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__de__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
__de__ of sleep-deprived women .
__de__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__de__ Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
__de__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__de__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__de__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__de__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__de__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
__de__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__de__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__de__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__de__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__de__ So a high I.Q.
__de__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__de__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__de__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__de__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__de__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__de__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
__de__ And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
__de__ Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
__de__ It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
__de__ And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
__de__ OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
__de__ I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
__de__ How does this happen ?
__de__ Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
__de__ One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
__de__ What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
__de__ What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
__de__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__de__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__de__ So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
__de__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__de__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__de__ If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
__de__ And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
__de__ And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
__de__ You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
__de__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__de__ I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
__de__ OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
__de__ But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
__de__ This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
__de__ She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
__de__ Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
__de__ Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
__de__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__de__ This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud .
__de__ I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Freudian view .
__de__ And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
__de__ Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
__de__ And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
__de__ And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
__de__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__de__ This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
__de__ It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Freudian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( Laughter )
__de__ He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__de__ Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there .
__de__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__de__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__de__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__de__ Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
__de__ There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
__de__ There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
__de__ You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
__de__ I talked about that earlier .
__de__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__de__ But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
__de__ Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
__de__ Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?
__de__ Which you can completely ignore .
__de__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
__de__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__de__ You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
__de__ And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
__de__ So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?
__de__ And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
__de__ So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
__de__ And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
__de__ But maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
__de__ So because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?
__de__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__de__ It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
__de__ Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
__de__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
__de__ And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
__de__ You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
__de__ ( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
__de__ You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
__de__ Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
__de__ There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
__de__ So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
__de__ It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
__de__ By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
__de__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__de__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__de__ The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
__de__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__de__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
__de__ OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
__de__ Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
__de__ And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
__de__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__de__ When an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
__de__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__de__ Believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
__de__ I &apos;ve had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
__de__ And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;
__de__ ( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that .
__de__ OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
__de__ One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
__de__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__de__ These are very compelling , vivid sensations .
__de__ The patient &apos;s not delusional .
__de__ He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
__de__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__de__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__de__ It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
__de__ If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
__de__ It sounds like an oxymoron .
__de__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__de__ The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
__de__ So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
__de__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__de__ Patients become depressed .
__de__ Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
__de__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__de__ Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
__de__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__de__ Why does this happen ?
__de__ When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
__de__ And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
__de__ The brain learns , because of this Hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
__de__ And then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?
__de__ Now , how do you help these patients ?
__de__ How do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
__de__ Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
__de__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
__de__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__de__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__de__ So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
__de__ ( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
__de__ You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
__de__ He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
__de__ He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
__de__ He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__de__ It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
__de__ So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
__de__ And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
__de__ He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
__de__ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
__de__ That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started giggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
__de__ He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
__de__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__de__ And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__de__ And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes .
__de__ &quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
__de__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;
__de__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__de__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__de__ So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
__de__ So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
__de__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
__de__ But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
__de__ So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
__de__ Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
__de__ I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
__de__ ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
__de__ It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
__de__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
__de__ But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
__de__ Now , why does this happen ?
__de__ It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
__de__ It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
__de__ On the other hand , there &apos;s no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
__de__ And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
__de__ It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
__de__ And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
__de__ So , that &apos;s the bonus .
__de__ Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
__de__ Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
__de__ But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
__de__ This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
__de__ OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
__de__ This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
__de__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__de__ He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
__de__ Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ?
__de__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__de__ Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
__de__ C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
__de__ Why does this happen ?
__de__ This is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
__de__ In us , all the senses are distinct .
__de__ These people muddle up their senses .
__de__ Why does this happen ?
__de__ One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
__de__ Synesthesia runs in families , so Galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
__de__ Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
__de__ Why would that be ?
__de__ I &apos;m going to answer that question .
__de__ It &apos;s never been answered before .
__de__ OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
__de__ Well , there are many theories .
__de__ One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
__de__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__de__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
__de__ Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
__de__ ( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?
__de__ So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
__de__ So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
__de__ So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia .
__de__ Now remember — why does this happen ?
__de__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__de__ Remember I said it runs in families ?
__de__ That gives you the clue .
__de__ And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
__de__ In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
__de__ So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
__de__ So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
__de__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
__de__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
__de__ So far , so good .
__de__ Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
__de__ Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?
__de__ I mean , schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
__de__ Normal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun .
__de__ Instantly , you &apos;ve found the links .
__de__ Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
__de__ And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
__de__ OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
__de__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__de__ ( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetes , but you &apos;re in denial about it .
__de__ Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
__de__ Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
__de__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__de__ One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
__de__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__de__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__de__ Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
__de__ ( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands .
__de__ Ninety-nine percent of you .
__de__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__de__ It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
__de__ Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
__de__ It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
__de__ If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glitters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
__de__ You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
__de__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__de__ Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
__de__ And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
__de__ All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) Sorry about that .
__de__ ( Laughter )
__de__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__de__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
__de__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
__de__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__de__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__de__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__de__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__de__ Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
__de__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__de__ I had to do something .
__de__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__de__ So I tried bronze casting .
__de__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__de__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__de__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
__de__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__de__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
__de__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__de__ I was mesmerized .
__de__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
__de__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__de__ Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
__de__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
__de__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__de__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__de__ Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__de__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
__de__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__de__ So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
__de__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__de__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__de__ I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
__de__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__de__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__de__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
__de__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
__de__ So we had to create one .
__de__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
__de__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__de__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
__de__ Now it had a sense of place .
__de__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__de__ As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__de__ My life was not going to be the same .
__de__ I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__de__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__de__ Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
__de__ So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__de__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__de__ Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__de__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__de__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__de__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
__de__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__de__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
__de__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__de__ Its shape was too complex now .
__de__ So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__de__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__de__ There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__de__ So we had to create it .
__de__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__de__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__de__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__de__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__de__ Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
__de__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__de__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__de__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__de__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__de__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
__de__ Thank you .
__de__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__de__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__de__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__de__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__de__ ( Applause )
__de__ But how have we headed in this direction ?
__de__ So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
__de__ A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day .

__de__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__de__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__de__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__de__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__de__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__de__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__de__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__de__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__de__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__de__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__de__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__de__ And I felt lighter in my body .
__ja__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__ja__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__ja__ While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__ja__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__ja__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__ja__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__ja__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__ja__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__ja__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__ja__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__ja__ There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
__ja__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__ja__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__ja__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__ja__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__ja__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__ja__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__ja__ One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
__ja__ ( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
__ja__ Death : Adam ?
__ja__ AO : Yeah .
__ja__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
__ja__ AO : Who is this ?
__ja__ Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
__ja__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__ja__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
__ja__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__ja__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__ja__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__ja__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__ja__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__ja__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__ja__ One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__ja__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
__ja__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__ja__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__ja__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__ja__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__ja__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__ja__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__ja__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__ja__ Thank you very much .

__ja__ People returning to work after a career break : I call them relaunchers .
__ja__ These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care , for childcare reasons , pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
__ja__ Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds : veterans , military spouses , retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats .
__ja__ This disconnect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
__ja__ Now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
__ja__ He &apos;s a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children .
__ja__ And speaking of long career breaks , this is Mimi Kahn .
__ja__ She &apos;s a social worker in Orange County , California , who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break .
__ja__ That &apos;s the longest career break that I &apos;m aware of .
__ja__ And this is Tracy Shapiro , who took a 13-year career break .
__ja__ Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home , but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work , plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working .
__ja__ Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
__ja__ She was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
__ja__ I met Tracy in June of 2011 , when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around .
__ja__ The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house .
__ja__ I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__ja__ I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversations that don &apos;t go anywhere .
__ja__ Expect that , and don &apos;t be discouraged by it .
__ja__ And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is frozen in time .
__ja__ And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
__ja__ So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this .
__ja__ And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news .
__ja__ I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here &apos;s why .
__ja__ We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations .
__ja__ We &apos;re in a more settled time of life .
__ja__ We have great work experience .
__ja__ We have a more mature perspective .
__ja__ We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employer &apos;s expense .
__ja__ Plus we have an energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
__ja__ On the flip side , I speak with employers , and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers .
__ja__ The first one is , employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete .
__ja__ I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3 .
__ja__ I don &apos;t know if anyone can even remember back that far , but I had to relearn it on Excel .
__ja__ I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software .
__ja__ And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
__ja__ And they do .
__ja__ That &apos;s not the employer &apos;s job .
__ja__ Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
__ja__ I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs .
__ja__ And at this point , hundreds of people have participated .
__ja__ This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
__ja__ And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a retiree internship program .
__ja__ Different pool , same concept .
__ja__ But it was a temp job .
__ja__ This was in the fall of 2011 .
__ja__ Fast forward to 2015 , Tracy &apos;s been promoted .
__ja__ Tracy &apos;s temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer .
__ja__ Now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
__ja__ But in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , don &apos;t hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
__ja__ Be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
__ja__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__ja__ Now I work in the solar technology industry .
__ja__ And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
__ja__ ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
__ja__ It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
__ja__ Huh . Hang on a moment .
__ja__ It might take a moment to load .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
__ja__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__ja__ ( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
__ja__ Okay . ( Laughter )
__ja__ Solar technology is ...
__ja__ Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
__ja__ Okay . Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
__ja__ I was working at the ACLU as the organization &apos;s science advisor .
__ja__ I really , really loved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged .
__ja__ So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
__ja__ Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years , so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights .
__ja__ I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck .
__ja__ I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties — super interesting .
__ja__ But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way , in a way that could really make a difference .
__ja__ So Chris cut right to the chase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination , and reproductive technologies , and biobanking , and ...
__ja__ oh , there &apos;s this really cool issue , functional MRI and using it for lie detection , and ...
__ja__ oh , and of course , there &apos;s gene patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; Gene patents ? &quot;
__ja__ &quot; Yes , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
__ja__ &quot; &quot; No !
__ja__ You &apos;re telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body ?
__ja__ That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
__ja__ And 20 minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
__ja__ &quot; Oh my god ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we sue ? &quot;
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
__ja__ I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
__ja__ So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit .
__ja__ First , we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene .
__ja__ Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of these are to so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — namely , a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell .
__ja__ Gene patent proponents say , &quot; &quot; See ? We didn &apos;t patent the gene in your body , we patented an isolated gene . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated .
__ja__ And the patents weren &apos;t just to a particular gene that they isolated , but on every possible version of that gene .
__ja__ So what does that mean ?
__ja__ That means that you can &apos;t give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mutations , without permission of the patent holder .
__ja__ It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing .
__ja__ Allowing patent holders , often private companies , to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients .
__ja__ Consider Abigail , a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome , a serious heart condition that , if left untreated , can result in sudden death .
__ja__ The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome .
__ja__ But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it .
__ja__ So another lab tried to offer the test , but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement .
__ja__ So as a result , for 2 years , no test was available .
__ja__ During that time , Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT .
__ja__ Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
__ja__ But was there a way we could challenge them ?
__ja__ Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases , that certain things are not patent eligible .
__ja__ You can &apos;t patent products of nature — the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
__ja__ And you can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
__ja__ These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none .
__ja__ It seemed to us that DNA , the most fundamental structure of life , that codes for the production of all of our proteins , is both a product of nature and a law of nature , regardless of whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube .
__ja__ As we delved into this issue , we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts — scientists , medical professionals , lawyers , patent lawyers .
__ja__ Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
__ja__ All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero .
__ja__ Why is that ?
__ja__ Well , the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years .
__ja__ There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
__ja__ The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo , the biotech industry had grown up around this practice , and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress , and had gone absolutely nowhere .
__ja__ So the bottom line : courts just weren &apos;t going to be willing to overturn these patents .
__ja__ Now , neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge , and hearing , &quot; &quot; Being right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; seemed all the more reason to take on this fight .
__ja__ So we set out to build our case .
__ja__ Now , patent cases tend to be : Company A sues Company B over some really narrow , obscure technical issue .
__ja__ We weren &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bigger than that .
__ja__ This was about scientific freedom , medical progress , the rights of patients .
__ja__ Myriad held patents on two genes , the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes .
__ja__ Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer .
__ja__ Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States .
__ja__ It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop .
__ja__ It charged a lot of money for its test — over 3,000 dollars .
__ja__ It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community .
__ja__ And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
__ja__ It has been estimated that during that period , for several years , as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer — a negative test result that should have been positive .
__ja__ This is Kathleen Maxian .
__ja__ Kathleen &apos;s sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad .
__ja__ The test was negative .
__ja__ The family was relieved .
__ja__ That meant that Eileen &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other members of her family didn &apos;t need to be tested .
__ja__ But two years later , Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer .
__ja__ It turned out that Kathleen &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result .
__ja__ Had Eileen received the proper result , Kathleen would have then been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
__ja__ One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
__ja__ So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention , and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
__ja__ How is DNA isolated , and why isn &apos;t that an invention ?
__ja__ We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts , trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately .
__ja__ And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors , like gold .
__ja__ So isolating DNA — it &apos;s like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed .
__ja__ You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
__ja__ It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain ; you still can &apos;t patent it , it &apos;s still gold .
__ja__ And the gold , once it &apos;s extracted , can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the mountain ; you can make jewelry out of it for example — still can &apos;t patent the gold , it &apos;s still gold .
__ja__ So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
__ja__ We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York , and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet .
__ja__ In March 2010 , Judge Sweet issued his opinion — 152 pages — and a complete victory for our side .
__ja__ In reading the opinion , we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case .
__ja__ I mean , our brief — it was pretty good , but not this good .
__ja__ How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
__ja__ We just could not comprehend how this had happened .
__ja__ So it turned out , Judge Sweet &apos;s clerk working for him at the time , was not just a lawyer — he was a scientist .
__ja__ He was not just a scientist — he had a PhD in molecular biology .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) What an incredible stroke of luck !
__ja__ Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
__ja__ And here things got really interesting .
__ja__ First , in a pivotal moment of this case , the US government switched sides .
__ja__ So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad &apos;s side .
__ja__ But now in direct opposition to its own patent office , the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court &apos;s opinion , and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible .
__ja__ This was a really big deal , totally unexpected .
__ja__ The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases , and it has a reputation for being very , very pro-patent .
__ja__ So even with this remarkable development , we expected to lose .
__ja__ And we did .
__ja__ Sort of .
__ja__ Ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
__ja__ But the two judges who ruled against us , did so for completely different reasons .
__ja__ The first one , Judge Lourie , made up his own novel , biological theory — totally wrong .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) He decided Myriad had created a new chemical — made absolutely no sense .
__ja__ Myriad didn &apos;t even argue this , so it came out of the blue .
__ja__ The other , Judge Moore , said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
__ja__ But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Judge Bryson , agreed with us .
__ja__ So now we sought review by the Supreme Court .
__ja__ And when you petition the Supreme Court , you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer .
__ja__ Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph , like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses , &quot; wherein this &quot; and &quot; therefore that . &quot;
__ja__ We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
__ja__ Four words : Are human genes patentable ?
__ja__ Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
__ja__ I think you have to say , &apos; Is isolated DNA patentable ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nope .
__ja__ I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
__ja__ The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives , and it agreed to hear ours .
__ja__ The day of the oral argument arrives , and it was really , really exciting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse .
__ja__ Two breast cancer organizations , Breast Cancer Action and FORCE , had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps .
__ja__ I was clearly more nervous than he was .
__ja__ But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces : our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories , the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical , patient advocacy , environmental and religious organizations , who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case .
__ja__ Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the co-discoverer of DNA himself , James Watson , who had submitted a brief to the court , where he referred to gene patenting as &quot; &quot; lunacy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake .
__ja__ The argument itself was riveting .
__ja__ Chris argued brilliantly .
__ja__ But for me , the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA , through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges , very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years .
__ja__ Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon .
__ja__ Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
__ja__ And in one of my absolutely favorite moments , Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day , but I could never have anticipated the outcome : nine to zero .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature , and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated .
__ja__ And furthermore , Myriad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; Within 24 hours of the decision , five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes .
__ja__ Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad &apos;s .
__ja__ Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering .
__ja__ But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
__ja__ It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States .
__ja__ It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation .
__ja__ And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail , Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need .
__ja__ A few weeks after the court issued its decision , I received a small package in the mail .
__ja__ It was from Bob Cook-Deegan , a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case .
__ja__ I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
__ja__ Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
__ja__ The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many twists and turns along the way .
__ja__ A little luck certainly helped , but it was the communities that we bridged , the alliances that we created , that made pigs fly .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__ja__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__ja__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__ja__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__ja__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__ja__ Where are economic networks ?
__ja__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__ja__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__ja__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__ja__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
__ja__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__ja__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
__ja__ We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
__ja__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__ja__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__ja__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__ja__ And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
__ja__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__ja__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__ja__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__ja__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__ja__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
__ja__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__ja__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__ja__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__ja__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__ja__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
__ja__ The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__ja__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__ja__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__ja__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__ja__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__ja__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__ja__ And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
__ja__ So this is how it works .
__ja__ This is a video prototype .
__ja__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__ja__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__ja__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
__ja__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__ja__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__ja__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__ja__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__ja__ So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__ja__ So this is a very early prototype .
__ja__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__ja__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
__ja__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__ja__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__ja__ So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__ja__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__ja__ On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__ja__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__ja__ Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__ja__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__ja__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__ja__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__ja__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__ja__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__ja__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__ja__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__ja__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
__ja__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
__ja__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__ja__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__ja__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__ja__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__ja__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__ja__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__ja__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__ja__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__ja__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__ja__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__ja__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__ja__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__ja__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__ja__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__ja__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__ja__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
__ja__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__ja__ So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__ja__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__ja__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__ja__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__ja__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
__ja__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__ja__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__ja__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ OK , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
__ja__ And specifically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love .
__ja__ Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this metaphor , falling , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
__ja__ I don &apos;t know about you , but when I conceptualize this metaphor , what I picture is straight out of a cartoon — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s walking down the sidewalk , without realizing it , he crosses over an open manhole , and he just plummets into the sewer below .
__ja__ And I picture it this way because falling is not jumping .
__ja__ Falling is accidental , it &apos;s uncontrollable .
__ja__ It &apos;s something that happens to us without our consent .
__ja__ And this — this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship .
__ja__ I am a writer and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which means I think about words for a living .
__ja__ You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters , and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem .
__ja__ So , in love , we fall .
__ja__ We &apos;re struck .
__ja__ We are crushed .
__ja__ We swoon .
__ja__ We burn with passion .
__ja__ Love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
__ja__ Our hearts ache , and then they break .
__ja__ So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) They do .
__ja__ And they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances .
__ja__ My favorite one of these is &quot; &quot; smitten , &quot; &quot; which is the past participle of the word &quot; &quot; smite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dictionary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defined as both &quot; &quot; grievous affliction , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I tend to associate the word &quot; &quot; smite &quot; &quot; with a very particular context , which is the Old Testament .
__ja__ In the Book of Exodus alone , there are 16 references to smiting , which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts . ( Laughter )
__ja__ Right ?
__ja__ So , how did this happen ?
__ja__ How have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering ?
__ja__ And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims ?
__ja__ These are difficult questions , but I have some theories .
__ja__ And to think this through , I want to focus on one metaphor in particular , which is the idea of love as madness .
__ja__ When I first started researching romantic love , I found these madness metaphors everywhere .
__ja__ The history of Western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness .
__ja__ These are just a few examples .
__ja__ William Shakespeare : &quot; Love is merely a madness , &quot; from &quot; &quot; As You Like It . &quot; &quot; Friedrich Nietzsche : &quot; There is always some madness in love . &quot;
__ja__ &quot; Got me looking , got me looking so crazy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great philosopher , Beyoncé Knowles . ( Laughter )
__ja__ I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
__ja__ And it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows .
__ja__ I can remember one moment in particular .
__ja__ I was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America , and I was watching the person I love walk out the door .
__ja__ And it was late , it was nearly midnight , we &apos;d gotten into an argument over dinner , and when we got back to our room , he threw his things in the bag and stormed out .
__ja__ While I can no longer remember what that argument was about , I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave .
__ja__ I was 22 , it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
__ja__ I had another week until my flight home , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around .
__ja__ I had no guidebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
__ja__ Someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just froze .
__ja__ I just sat there .
__ja__ And then I burst into tears .
__ja__ But despite my panic , some small voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
__ja__ I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love .
__ja__ And it sounds so strange to me now , but at 22 , I longed to have dramatic experiences , and in that moment , I was irrational and furious and devastated , and weirdly enough , I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me .
__ja__ I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how loved worked .
__ja__ This really should not be surprising , considering that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two albums and one novel with the title &quot; &quot; Crazy Love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he came back to our room .
__ja__ We made up .
__ja__ We spent another mostly happy week traveling together .
__ja__ And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terrible and so great .
__ja__ This must be a real romance . &quot; &quot; I expected my first love to feel like madness , and of course , it met that expectation very well .
__ja__ But loving someone like that — as if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
__ja__ But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
__ja__ Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love .
__ja__ In fact , there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal , because , neurochemically speaking , romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished .
__ja__ This is true .
__ja__ This study from 1999 used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Yes , and low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression .
__ja__ So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors .
__ja__ And there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way .
__ja__ Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
__ja__ And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
__ja__ But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usually from a few months to a couple of years .
__ja__ When I got back from my trip to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , checking my email , desperate to hear from the guy I loved .
__ja__ I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction , then I did not need their friendship .
__ja__ So I stopped hanging out with most of them .
__ja__ And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life .
__ja__ But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable , because if I could be miserable , then I would prove how much I loved him .
__ja__ And if I could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
__ja__ This is the real madness , because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward , but we talk about love as if this is true .
__ja__ Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
__ja__ Our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a breakup , that neurochemical reward is withdrawn .
__ja__ And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neurochemically speaking , going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal , which I find reassuring .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love .
__ja__ In this case , we &apos;re talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness .
__ja__ It &apos;s kind of an interesting feedback loop .
__ja__ Love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
__ja__ What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy .
__ja__ It seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like madness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
__ja__ That sounds terrible .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) To reconcile this , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
__ja__ So , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
__ja__ If we were more assertive , more open-minded , more generous and instead of falling in love , we stepped into love .
__ja__ I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
__ja__ In their book , &quot; &quot; Metaphors We Live By , &quot; &quot; linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma , which is to change our metaphors .
__ja__ They argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a guide for future actions , like self-fulfilling prophecies .
__ja__ Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collaborative work of art .
__ja__ I really like this way of thinking about love .
__ja__ Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments , which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of , or ideas contained within , a given metaphor .
__ja__ And Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails : effort , compromise , patience , shared goals .
__ja__ These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long-term romantic commitment , but they also work well for other kinds of relationships — short-term , casual , polyamorous , non-monogamous , asexual — because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone .
__ja__ So if love is a collaborative work of art , then love is an aesthetic experience .
__ja__ Love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustrating and emotionally demanding .
__ja__ And love involves both joy and pain .
__ja__ Ultimately , each experience of love is different .
__ja__ When I was younger , it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accept whatever love offered .
__ja__ When 14-year-old Juliet first meets — or , when 14-year-old Juliet cannot be with Romeo , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disappointed or angsty .
__ja__ Where is she ?
__ja__ She wants to die .
__ja__ Right ?
__ja__ And just as a refresher , at this point in the play , act three of five , Romeo is not dead .
__ja__ He &apos;s alive , he &apos;s healthy , he &apos;s just been banished from the city .
__ja__ I understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Juliet &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
__ja__ Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent , is empowering .
__ja__ It &apos;s still hard .
__ja__ Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together .
__ja__ This isn &apos;t easy , either .
__ja__ But it &apos;s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like madness .
__ja__ This version of love is not about winning or losing someone &apos;s affection .
__ja__ Instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
__ja__ This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
__ja__ This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good collaborators . Maybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;
__ja__ Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shorter than I had planned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself .
__ja__ This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
__ja__ And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
__ja__ And not frozen water , and not water in a gaseous state , but liquid water .
__ja__ So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
__ja__ So let &apos;s make the problem simpler for ourselves .
__ja__ You have to be very careful with that atmosphere .
__ja__ They &apos;re not static things . They change .
__ja__ They vary . They evolve .
__ja__ And atmospheres do the same .
__ja__ Well , one idea is it escaped away to space .
__ja__ Comets have tails that are incredibly visible reminders of atmospheric escape .
__ja__ A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind .
__ja__ This is something that I &apos;m interested in , because it relates to habitability .
__ja__ And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
__ja__ This has to play into habitability .
__ja__ But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
__ja__ If you have a compass , you know which way north is .
__ja__ The sails may gather energy from the solar wind .
__ja__ If you &apos;ve ever experienced them , it &apos;s magnificent .
__ja__ Once we have that answer , why should you care ?
__ja__ And financially as well , but deeply .
__ja__ We &apos;ve gone , in 20 years , from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system , to now having so many , that we don &apos;t know which ones to investigate first .
__ja__ You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet .
__ja__ In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
__ja__ This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habitable , although very soon we may come to know of more .
__ja__ But for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red spot .
__ja__ Thanks .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I love the Internet .
__ja__ It &apos;s true .
__ja__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__ja__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__ja__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__ja__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__ja__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__ja__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__ja__ So let me show you something .
__ja__ This here is Brain .
__ja__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__ja__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__ja__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__ja__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__ja__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__ja__ All right .
__ja__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__ja__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__ja__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__ja__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__ja__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__ja__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__ja__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__ja__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__ja__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__ja__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__ja__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
__ja__ And I knocked on the door .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__ja__ Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Basit .
__ja__ Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
__ja__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__ja__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__ja__ I asked them why .
__ja__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__ja__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__ja__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__ja__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__ja__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__ja__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__ja__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__ja__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__ja__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__ja__ For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
__ja__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__ja__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__ja__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__ja__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__ja__ ( Siren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__ja__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__ja__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__ja__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__ja__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__ja__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__ja__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__ja__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__ja__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
__ja__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__ja__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__ja__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__ja__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__ja__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__ja__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__ja__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
__ja__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__ja__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__ja__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__ja__ So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
__ja__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
__ja__ Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__ja__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__ja__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__ja__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__ja__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__ja__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__ja__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__ja__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__ja__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__ja__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__ja__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__ja__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__ja__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
__ja__ We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
__ja__ These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
__ja__ They are both right now on the run .
__ja__ Nobody knows where they are .
__ja__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__ja__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__ja__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__ja__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
__ja__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
__ja__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__ja__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__ja__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__ja__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__ja__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__ja__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__ja__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__ja__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__ja__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__ja__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__ja__ How do you actually track them down ?
__ja__ Let me give you an example .
__ja__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__ja__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__ja__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__ja__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__ja__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
__ja__ It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
__ja__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__ja__ And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
__ja__ Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
__ja__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__ja__ But just keep staring at it .
__ja__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__ja__ And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
__ja__ But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
__ja__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__ja__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__ja__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__ja__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__ja__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__ja__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__ja__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
__ja__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
__ja__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__ja__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__ja__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__ja__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__ja__ And he drives a very nice car .
__ja__ In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__ja__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
__ja__ How do I know about this car ?
__ja__ Because he blogged about the car .
__ja__ He actually had a car accident .
__ja__ In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__ja__ And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
__ja__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
__ja__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
__ja__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__ja__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__ja__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__ja__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__ja__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__ja__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__ja__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__ja__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__ja__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__ja__ That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__ja__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__ja__ This is what runs everything around us .
__ja__ PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__ja__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__ja__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__ja__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__ja__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__ja__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__ja__ Everything is being run by computers .
__ja__ Everything is reliant on these computers working .
__ja__ We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__ja__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__ja__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__ja__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__ja__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__ja__ Think about all the services we have online .
__ja__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__ja__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__ja__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__ja__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__ja__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__ja__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__ja__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
__ja__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__ja__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__ja__ Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__ja__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__ja__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__ja__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__ja__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__ja__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__ja__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__ja__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__ja__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__ja__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__ja__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__ja__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__ja__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__ja__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__ja__ This is an illusion .
__ja__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__ja__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__ja__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__ja__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__ja__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__ja__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__ja__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__ja__ We can &apos;t .
__ja__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__ja__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__ja__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__ja__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__ja__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__ja__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__ja__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__ja__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__ja__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__ja__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__ja__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__ja__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__ja__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__ja__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__ja__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__ja__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__ja__ And what does it mean ?
__ja__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__ja__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__ja__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__ja__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__ja__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__ja__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__ja__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__ja__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__ja__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__ja__ One country , two systems .
__ja__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__ja__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__ja__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__ja__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__ja__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__ja__ What happened ?
__ja__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__ja__ One nation , one system .
__ja__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__ja__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__ja__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__ja__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__ja__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__ja__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__ja__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__ja__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__ja__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__ja__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__ja__ So the question is , why ?
__ja__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__ja__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__ja__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__ja__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__ja__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__ja__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__ja__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__ja__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__ja__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__ja__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__ja__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__ja__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__ja__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__ja__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__ja__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__ja__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__ja__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__ja__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__ja__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__ja__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__ja__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__ja__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__ja__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__ja__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__ja__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__ja__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__ja__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__ja__ The state is everywhere in China .
__ja__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__ja__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__ja__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__ja__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__ja__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__ja__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__ja__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__ja__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__ja__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__ja__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__ja__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__ja__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__ja__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__ja__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__ja__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__ja__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__ja__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__ja__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__ja__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__ja__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__ja__ But it &apos;s not .
__ja__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__ja__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__ja__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__ja__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__ja__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__ja__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__ja__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__ja__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__ja__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__ja__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__ja__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__ja__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__ja__ And there are two consequences of this .
__ja__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__ja__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__ja__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__ja__ When did that last happen ?
__ja__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__ja__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__ja__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__ja__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__ja__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__ja__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__ja__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__ja__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__ja__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__ja__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__ja__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__ja__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__ja__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__ja__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__ja__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__ja__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__ja__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__ja__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__ja__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__ja__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__ja__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__ja__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__ja__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__ja__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__ja__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__ja__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__ja__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__ja__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__ja__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__ja__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__ja__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__ja__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__ja__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__ja__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__ja__ By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__ja__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__ja__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__ja__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__ja__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__ja__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__ja__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__ja__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__ja__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__ja__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__ja__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__ja__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__ja__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__ja__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__ja__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__ja__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__ja__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__ja__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__ja__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__ja__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__ja__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__ja__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__ja__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__ja__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__ja__ Last .
__ja__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
__ja__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__ja__ And these are facts , guys .
__ja__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
__ja__ It &apos;s not .
__ja__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__ja__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__ja__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__ja__ We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__ja__ How did this happen ?
__ja__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__ja__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
__ja__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__ja__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__ja__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__ja__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__ja__ We don &apos;t value play .
__ja__ In fact , we devalue play .
__ja__ And we devalue it in three areas .
__ja__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__ja__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__ja__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__ja__ And instead , what do we value ?
__ja__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__ja__ To be serious .
__ja__ To be really , really serious .
__ja__ It did .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__ja__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__ja__ Heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
__ja__ I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__ja__ We have a serious meme running through .
__ja__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__ja__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__ja__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__ja__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . Iskam baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woohoo !
__ja__ But then what happens in step three ?
__ja__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
__ja__ But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__ja__ So what happens ?
__ja__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__ja__ What happens then ?
__ja__ It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__ja__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__ja__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__ja__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__ja__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__ja__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
__ja__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__ja__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__ja__ We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
__ja__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__ja__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__ja__ What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
__ja__ Autocratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__ja__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__ja__ Untrusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__ja__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.M.
__ja__ That &apos;s somehow unprofessional and bad .
__ja__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s unfulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__ja__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__ja__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__ja__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__ja__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__ja__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__ja__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__ja__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__ja__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__ja__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__ja__ And you know what ?
__ja__ Evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that aren &apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__ja__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__ja__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . Ants play .
__ja__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__ja__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__ja__ Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__ja__ Kittens play . We all know kittens play .
__ja__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__ja__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__ja__ Bears play .
__ja__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__ja__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__ja__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__ja__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__ja__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__ja__ Dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__ja__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__ja__ Yours truly : humans .
__ja__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__ja__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__ja__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__ja__ Really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__ja__ And who are the biggest neotenists ?
__ja__ Humans . We play sports .
__ja__ We do it for fun , or as Olympians , or as professionals .
__ja__ We play musical instruments .
__ja__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
__ja__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__ja__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__ja__ It is a huge benefit .
__ja__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__ja__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__ja__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__ja__ As a result , what happens ?
__ja__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__ja__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__ja__ These guys are facts .
__ja__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__ja__ These are the benefits to play .
__ja__ It is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__ja__ And if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
__ja__ We hold ourselves back .
__ja__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__ja__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__ja__ What does this world look like ?
__ja__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__ja__ It &apos;s pretty glum .
__ja__ Now imagine your workplace .
__ja__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__ja__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__ja__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__ja__ Or is it crap ? Is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
__ja__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__ja__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__ja__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__ja__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__ja__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__ja__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__ja__ In fact , play improves our work .
__ja__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__ja__ For example , it stimulates creativity .
__ja__ It increases our openness to change .
__ja__ It improves our ability to learn .
__ja__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__ja__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__ja__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__ja__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
__ja__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__ja__ Our thinking is backwards .
__ja__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__ja__ We should be celebrating play .
__ja__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__ja__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__ja__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__ja__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__ja__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__ja__ And what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
__ja__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__ja__ People , service , profit .
__ja__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__ja__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__ja__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__ja__ One , play is universal .
__ja__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__ja__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sciant .
__ja__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__ja__ Not one customer would refer us .
__ja__ I asked them all .
__ja__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__ja__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__ja__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
__ja__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__ja__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__ja__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__ja__ Basically promoting fun .
__ja__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__ja__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
__ja__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__ja__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__ja__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__ja__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__ja__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__ja__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__ja__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__ja__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__ja__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__ja__ Rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__ja__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__ja__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__ja__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__ja__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__ja__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__ja__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__ja__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__ja__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__ja__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__ja__ Let them be on the Internet .
__ja__ Let them be on instant messengers .
__ja__ Let them take long lunches .
__ja__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__ja__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__ja__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__ja__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__ja__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__ja__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__ja__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__ja__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__ja__ of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__ja__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__ja__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__ja__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__ja__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__ja__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__ja__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__ja__ So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
__ja__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__ja__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__ja__ Even the BBC and The New York Times .
__ja__ So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__ja__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__ja__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__ja__ And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
__ja__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__ja__ For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
__ja__ If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
__ja__ We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__ja__ So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
__ja__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__ja__ I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
__ja__ And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__ja__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__ja__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__ja__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__ja__ This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied .
__ja__ We make ourselves small .
__ja__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__ja__ So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
__ja__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__ja__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__ja__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__ja__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__ja__ So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
__ja__ Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__ja__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__ja__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__ja__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__ja__ There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
__ja__ So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
__ja__ So it goes both ways .
__ja__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__ja__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__ja__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__ja__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
__ja__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__ja__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__ja__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__ja__ So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__ja__ Probably not , right ?
__ja__ So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
__ja__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__ja__ Here are a couple more .
__ja__ So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
__ja__ And here are the low-power poses .
__ja__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__ja__ When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
__ja__ So this is what happens .
__ja__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__ja__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__ja__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__ja__ Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
__ja__ So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__ja__ Also , our bodies change our minds .
__ja__ And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
__ja__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__ja__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__ja__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__ja__ It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
__ja__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
__ja__ People hate this .
__ja__ We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
__ja__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__ja__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__ja__ These kinds of things .
__ja__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
__ja__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__ja__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__ja__ I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
__ja__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__ja__ I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
__ja__ I was thrown from the car .
__ja__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__ja__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__ja__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__ja__ I am an impostor .
__ja__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__ja__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__ja__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__ja__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__ja__ So she had changed .
__ja__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__ja__ Fake it till you become it .
__ja__ Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
__ja__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__ja__ Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
__ja__ So , this is two minutes .
__ja__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__ja__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__ja__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
__ja__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__ja__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__ja__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__ja__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__ja__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__ja__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__ja__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__ja__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__ja__ This is a time of need .
__ja__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__ja__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__ja__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__ja__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__ja__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__ja__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__ja__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__ja__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__ja__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__ja__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__ja__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__ja__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__ja__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__ja__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__ja__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__ja__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__ja__ The earth moved for both of them .
__ja__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__ja__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__ja__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__ja__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__ja__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__ja__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__ja__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__ja__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
__ja__ All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
__ja__ So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
__ja__ Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
__ja__ BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
__ja__ BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
__ja__ Audience : What are you reading ?
__ja__ BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
__ja__ I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
__ja__ It literally says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
__ja__ That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
__ja__ It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
__ja__ Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
__ja__ All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ow ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
__ja__ But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
__ja__ And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
__ja__ Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
__ja__ But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
__ja__ Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
__ja__ They begin with a question .
__ja__ The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
__ja__ Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
__ja__ Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
__ja__ Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
__ja__ Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
__ja__ The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
__ja__ And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
__ja__ So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
__ja__ And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
__ja__ They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
__ja__ It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
__ja__ So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
__ja__ It &apos;s play .
__ja__ Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
__ja__ Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
__ja__ Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
__ja__ Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
__ja__ Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
__ja__ It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
__ja__ So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
__ja__ That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
__ja__ So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
__ja__ And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
__ja__ Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
__ja__ The first step was to ask a question .
__ja__ Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
__ja__ So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
__ja__ So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
__ja__ So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
__ja__ Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
__ja__ She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
__ja__ Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
__ja__ Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
__ja__ So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
__ja__ Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
__ja__ But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
__ja__ So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
__ja__ Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
__ja__ Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
__ja__ But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
__ja__ AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
__ja__ We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
__ja__ They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
__ja__ Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
__ja__ What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
__ja__ It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
__ja__ It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
__ja__ So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
__ja__ ( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5C .
__ja__ Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
__ja__ Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
__ja__ BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
__ja__ Student : There &apos;s two up there .
__ja__ And three in here .
__ja__ BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
__ja__ They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
__ja__ And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
__ja__ So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
__ja__ So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
__ja__ The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
__ja__ Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
__ja__ And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
__ja__ That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
__ja__ It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
__ja__ So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
__ja__ All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
__ja__ The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
__ja__ Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
__ja__ The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
__ja__ They say no .
__ja__ So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
__ja__ And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
__ja__ What was the feedback like ?
__ja__ Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
__ja__ It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
__ja__ It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
__ja__ It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
__ja__ Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
__ja__ And I &apos;ll just read one .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
__ja__ What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
__ja__ Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
__ja__ Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
__ja__ Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
__ja__ Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
__ja__ Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
__ja__ Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
__ja__ BL : This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
__ja__ Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
__ja__ You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
__ja__ ( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
__ja__ Audience : ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
__ja__ Everyone over there shout . ( Shouts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
__ja__ Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
__ja__ That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
__ja__ Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
__ja__ So , Amy ?
__ja__ AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
__ja__ Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
__ja__ But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
__ja__ You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
__ja__ Thank you.BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__ja__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__ja__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__ja__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__ja__ So get out your pen and paper .
__ja__ Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__ja__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__ja__ There are 800 million people starving .
__ja__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__ja__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__ja__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__ja__ The lists go on and on .
__ja__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__ja__ There are many , many problems out there .
__ja__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__ja__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__ja__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__ja__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__ja__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__ja__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__ja__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__ja__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__ja__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__ja__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__ja__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__ja__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__ja__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__ja__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__ja__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__ja__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__ja__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__ja__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__ja__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__ja__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__ja__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__ja__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__ja__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__ja__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__ja__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__ja__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__ja__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__ja__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__ja__ And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__ja__ Nobody wants to do this .
__ja__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__ja__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__ja__ And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__ja__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__ja__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
__ja__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__ja__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__ja__ We have not had an idea .
__ja__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__ja__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__ja__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__ja__ It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
__ja__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__ja__ And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__ja__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
__ja__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__ja__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__ja__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__ja__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__ja__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__ja__ What would be the price ?
__ja__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__ja__ And so on .
__ja__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__ja__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
__ja__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__ja__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__ja__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__ja__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__ja__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__ja__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
__ja__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__ja__ That is what economists do .
__ja__ They prioritize .
__ja__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__ja__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__ja__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__ja__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__ja__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__ja__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__ja__ These were the bad projects .
__ja__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__ja__ This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__ja__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__ja__ Why is it it came up ?
__ja__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__ja__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__ja__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__ja__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__ja__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__ja__ What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__ja__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__ja__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__ja__ Yet it would do very little good .
__ja__ All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
__ja__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
__ja__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__ja__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__ja__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__ja__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__ja__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__ja__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__ja__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__ja__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__ja__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__ja__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__ja__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__ja__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__ja__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__ja__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__ja__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__ja__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__ja__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__ja__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__ja__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__ja__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__ja__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__ja__ This third best one was free trade .
__ja__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
__ja__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__ja__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__ja__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__ja__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
__ja__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
__ja__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
__ja__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__ja__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__ja__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__ja__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__ja__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__ja__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__ja__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__ja__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__ja__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__ja__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__ja__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__ja__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__ja__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__ja__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__ja__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__ja__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__ja__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__ja__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__ja__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__ja__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__ja__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__ja__ And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__ja__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__ja__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__ja__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__ja__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__ja__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__ja__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__ja__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__ja__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__ja__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__ja__ Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__ja__ Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
__ja__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__ja__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__ja__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__ja__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__ja__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__ja__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__ja__ The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
__ja__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__ja__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__ja__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__ja__ Since then our aid has halved .
__ja__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__ja__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__ja__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__ja__ I &apos;m all for that .
__ja__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__ja__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__ja__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__ja__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__ja__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__ja__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__ja__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__ja__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__ja__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__ja__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__ja__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__ja__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__ja__ There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
__ja__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__ja__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__ja__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__ja__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__ja__ I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
__ja__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__ja__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
__ja__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__ja__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__ja__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ The year is 1800 .
__ja__ A curious little invention is being talked about .
__ja__ It &apos;s called a microscope .
__ja__ What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
__ja__ Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
__ja__ Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . This is from London .
__ja__ Fast forward 200 years .
__ja__ We still have this monster soup around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
__ja__ Just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
__ja__ Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
__ja__ You take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
__ja__ They all have faces .
__ja__ Why is that so , that Alex in Kenya , Fatima in Bangladesh , Navjoot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
__ja__ And that &apos;s primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
__ja__ And remember that number : one billion .
__ja__ The problem lies with the microscope itself .
__ja__ Even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
__ja__ Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
__ja__ They are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
__ja__ This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India .
__ja__ Two of my students , Jim and James , traveled around India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
__ja__ We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
__ja__ We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
__ja__ And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
__ja__ What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes .
__ja__ So what is a Foldscope ?
__ja__ A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
__ja__ So , now you think , how is that possible ?
__ja__ I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
__ja__ It starts with a single sheet of paper .
__ja__ What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope .
__ja__ So , there are three stages : There is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage .
__ja__ And there are micro optics at the bottom that &apos;s actually embedded in the paper itself .
__ja__ What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
__ja__ This paper has no instructions and no languages .
__ja__ There is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
__ja__ When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an XY stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
__ja__ We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
__ja__ So this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
__ja__ You pop this in .
__ja__ There is an XY stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
__ja__ So what &apos;s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
__ja__ I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
__ja__ And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
__ja__ Another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder .
__ja__ And I &apos;m going to pick one randomly .
__ja__ This one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
__ja__ So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
__ja__ So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these setups .
__ja__ So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
__ja__ I have these two microscopes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
__ja__ What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-axis .
__ja__ You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern .
__ja__ Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
__ja__ Right there .
__ja__ All from the simple setup that I actually described .
__ja__ So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer .
__ja__ So it turns out they &apos;re waterproof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
__ja__ This also shows you how the projection scope works .
__ja__ You get to see the beam the way it &apos;s projected and bent .
__ja__ Can we get the lights back on again ?
__ja__ So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
__ja__ ( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy , which we call use-and-throw microscopy .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
__ja__ Here is a sheet of paper .
__ja__ This is when we were thinking about the idea .
__ja__ This is an A4 sheet of paper .
__ja__ These are the three stages that you actually see .
__ja__ And the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
__ja__ So that &apos;s where the lenses go .
__ja__ There are some light sources .
__ja__ And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
__ja__ So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
__ja__ So here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
__ja__ There it is , and it survives .
__ja__ So for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
__ja__ We are starting at the end of the summer .
__ja__ We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscopes .
__ja__ That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
__ja__ We &apos;ve started collecting data for malaria , Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
__ja__ And I want to leave you with this picture .
__ja__ I had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
__ja__ What are the tools that we &apos;re actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
__ja__ I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
__ja__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__ja__ They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and carroças .
__ja__ But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
__ja__ By adding art and humor to the cause , it became more appealing , which helped call attention to the catadores and improve their self-esteem .
__ja__ So , the thing is , I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
__ja__ And then I realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to Brazil .
__ja__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__ja__ ( Applause ) .
__ja__ So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças .
__ja__ Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
__ja__ Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
__ja__ So now everybody can join .
__ja__ So catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
__ja__ Because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__ja__ So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city .
__ja__ Try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
__ja__ Believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
__ja__ So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
__ja__ Muito obrigado , thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause ) .
__ja__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
__ja__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__ja__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__ja__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__ja__ Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__ja__ So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__ja__ This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades .
__ja__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__ja__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__ja__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__ja__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__ja__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__ja__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__ja__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__ja__ These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
__ja__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
__ja__ Everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__ja__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__ja__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__ja__ This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__ja__ So this one was taken around five .
__ja__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__ja__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__ja__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__ja__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
__ja__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__ja__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__ja__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__ja__ We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
__ja__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__ja__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__ja__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__ja__ ( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__ja__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
__ja__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__ja__ So , these are our friends in Pike Place Market , the lab .
__ja__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__ja__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__ja__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__ja__ No , no . The other way .
__ja__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__ja__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__ja__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__ja__ OK , never mind .
__ja__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__ja__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__ja__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__ja__ One of them is to take that real ...
__ja__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__ja__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__ja__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__ja__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__ja__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__ja__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__ja__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4G network from the market .
__ja__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__ja__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__ja__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__ja__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__ja__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__ja__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__ja__ So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__ja__ All right now , I &apos;ve overrun my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__ja__ Thank you all very much .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
__ja__ And let me start with this .
__ja__ This is my baseline : This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
__ja__ Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
__ja__ Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
__ja__ If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
__ja__ Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
__ja__ So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the greenish part of the picture .
__ja__ Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
__ja__ And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
__ja__ And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
__ja__ This is their baseline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
__ja__ So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
__ja__ This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
__ja__ So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
__ja__ Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — overgrown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
__ja__ We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
__ja__ We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
__ja__ This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore .
__ja__ Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
__ja__ Fanning Island , 2,500 people .
__ja__ The corals are doing better here . Lots of small fish .
__ja__ This is what many divers would consider paradise .
__ja__ This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
__ja__ And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
__ja__ If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
__ja__ You can see sharks in every single dive .
__ja__ And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
__ja__ But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
__ja__ What have we learned from these places ?
__ja__ This is what we thought was natural .
__ja__ This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
__ja__ If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
__ja__ Most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
__ja__ Then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
__ja__ And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
__ja__ But this is a consequence .
__ja__ This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
__ja__ When we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
__ja__ The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
__ja__ The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more of everything .
__ja__ The size of these boxes is bigger .
__ja__ We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , more biomass of herbivores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
__ja__ They clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish .
__ja__ Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
__ja__ But still , now we have global warming .
__ja__ If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
__ja__ But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
__ja__ So how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
__ja__ In Christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
__ja__ In Fanning Island , the corals are not recovered .
__ja__ But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
__ja__ And the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
__ja__ Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
__ja__ And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
__ja__ These places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
__ja__ The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
__ja__ And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
__ja__ We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
__ja__ So if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
__ja__ Well , there are several ways .
__ja__ One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
__ja__ And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean .
__ja__ This was my baseline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
__ja__ And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
__ja__ And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
__ja__ But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
__ja__ And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
__ja__ After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
__ja__ So you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
__ja__ And this particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
__ja__ So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
__ja__ So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
__ja__ These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
__ja__ The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
__ja__ This is very substantial .
__ja__ The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
__ja__ The abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
__ja__ And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
__ja__ In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
__ja__ So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
__ja__ They reproduce . That &apos;s population biology 101 .
__ja__ If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
__ja__ And same thing for invertebrates . This is the example .
__ja__ These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
__ja__ Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
__ja__ One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
__ja__ So these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
__ja__ This is in the Bahamas : Nassau grouper .
__ja__ Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
__ja__ So the fishermen are catching more .
__ja__ You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
__ja__ So there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building resilience .
__ja__ So what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
__ja__ Reserves are like savings accounts .
__ja__ We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
__ja__ And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
__ja__ Two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
__ja__ This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a free-for-all .
__ja__ Once the most degrading fishing gear , seine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
__ja__ If you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
__ja__ But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
__ja__ Another example : Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef .
__ja__ This is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
__ja__ They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare , in one aggregation .
__ja__ Fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
__ja__ When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left .
__ja__ And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
__ja__ So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
__ja__ And with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
__ja__ It happened in many places around the Caribbean .
__ja__ And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
__ja__ Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
__ja__ So how much of this do we have ?
__ja__ We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
__ja__ Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
__ja__ The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
__ja__ Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
__ja__ Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
__ja__ Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
__ja__ Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
__ja__ People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
__ja__ A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
__ja__ So how can we do that ?
__ja__ If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
__ja__ And how can we reach that goal ?
__ja__ Well , there are two ways of getting there .
__ja__ The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago .
__ja__ The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
__ja__ And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
__ja__ But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
__ja__ Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
__ja__ Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
__ja__ It &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
__ja__ Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
__ja__ NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
__ja__ So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
__ja__ So the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
__ja__ First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .
__ja__ It &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
__ja__ Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
__ja__ And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
__ja__ The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
__ja__ We really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
__ja__ And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
__ja__ There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
__ja__ The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
__ja__ So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric .
__ja__ Enric Sala : Thank you .
__ja__ CA : That was a masterful job of pulling things together .
__ja__ First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
__ja__ How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
__ja__ ES : Well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
__ja__ The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
__ja__ That &apos;s basically it .
__ja__ The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
__ja__ Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
__ja__ They reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
__ja__ So , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
__ja__ They are like capacitors of the system .
__ja__ CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
__ja__ So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
__ja__ ES : At least in the seas .
__ja__ What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest .
__ja__ And on land , this cannot work .
__ja__ But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
__ja__ We think this is universal .
__ja__ But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
__ja__ CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
__ja__ You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
__ja__ It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
__ja__ If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
__ja__ We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
__ja__ ES : And then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
__ja__ So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
__ja__ CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
__ja__ So thank you for those numbers .
__ja__ The last one &apos;s a personal question .
__ja__ A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
__ja__ Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
__ja__ ES : It is a spiritual experience .
__ja__ We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
__ja__ But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
__ja__ And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
__ja__ And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
__ja__ It would be just too depressing .
__ja__ CA : Well , Enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
__ja__ ES : Thank you very much .
__ja__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__ja__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__ja__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__ja__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__ja__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__ja__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__ja__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__ja__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__ja__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__ja__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__ja__ We get it in the abstract .
__ja__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__ja__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__ja__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__ja__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__ja__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__ja__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__ja__ I think this is a problem .
__ja__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__ja__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__ja__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__ja__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__ja__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__ja__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__ja__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__ja__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__ja__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__ja__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__ja__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__ja__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__ja__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__ja__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__ja__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__ja__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__ja__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__ja__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__ja__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__ja__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__ja__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__ja__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__ja__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__ja__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__ja__ I call this error blindness .
__ja__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__ja__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__ja__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__ja__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__ja__ This is not mine , by the way .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__ja__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__ja__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__ja__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__ja__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__ja__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__ja__ Okay , so fine .
__ja__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__ja__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__ja__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__ja__ So let me tell you a story .
__ja__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__ja__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__ja__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__ja__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__ja__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__ja__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__ja__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__ja__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__ja__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__ja__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__ja__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__ja__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__ja__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__ja__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__ja__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__ja__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__ja__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__ja__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__ja__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__ja__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__ja__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__ja__ So this is a catastrophe .
__ja__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__ja__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__ja__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__ja__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__ja__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__ja__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__ja__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__ja__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__ja__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__ja__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__ja__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__ja__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__ja__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__ja__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__ja__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__ja__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__ja__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__ja__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__ja__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__ja__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__ja__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__ja__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__ja__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__ja__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__ja__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__ja__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__ja__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__ja__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__ja__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__ja__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__ja__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__ja__ And something else happened instead .
__ja__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__ja__ And something else happened instead .
__ja__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__ja__ And something else happened instead .
__ja__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__ja__ And something else happened instead .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__ja__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__ja__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__ja__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__ja__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__ja__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__ja__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__ja__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__ja__ We come up with another idea .
__ja__ We tell another story .
__ja__ We hold another conference .
__ja__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__ja__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__ja__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__ja__ On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
__ja__ Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations headquarters .
__ja__ Thankfully , those plans were foiled by an FBI informant .
__ja__ Sadly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not .
__ja__ Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__ja__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__ja__ I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
__ja__ It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
__ja__ My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
__ja__ It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
__ja__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__ja__ A few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
__ja__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__ja__ We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range , which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI .
__ja__ When it was my turn to shoot , my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off .
__ja__ That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
__ja__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__ja__ They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
__ja__ They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
__ja__ Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
__ja__ These were the men I looked up to .
__ja__ These were the men I called ammu , which means uncle .
__ja__ By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
__ja__ Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
__ja__ Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bullies .
__ja__ I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
__ja__ So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
__ja__ For those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigoted household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world .
__ja__ I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
__ja__ So what opened my eyes ?
__ja__ One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
__ja__ Through a college prep program , I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia .
__ja__ My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
__ja__ The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
__ja__ One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish .
__ja__ Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us .
__ja__ I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable .
__ja__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
__ja__ There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
__ja__ Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
__ja__ As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kindest , least judgmental people I had ever met .
__ja__ Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
__ja__ Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
__ja__ I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acquainted with being judged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
__ja__ Then there was &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; On a nightly basis , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
__ja__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__ja__ Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
__ja__ One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live .
__ja__ She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hating people . &quot;
__ja__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__ja__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__ja__ I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
__ja__ So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
__ja__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__ja__ I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that I did not become fanaticized .
__ja__ Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
__ja__ I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
__ja__ For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father &apos;s actions .
__ja__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__ja__ I am not my father .
__ja__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__ja__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__ja__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__ja__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__ja__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__ja__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__ja__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
__ja__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__ja__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__ja__ It &apos;s tedious .
__ja__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__ja__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__ja__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__ja__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__ja__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__ja__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__ja__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__ja__ My idea is : no ! No !
__ja__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__ja__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__ja__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__ja__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__ja__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__ja__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__ja__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__ja__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__ja__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__ja__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__ja__ They know .
__ja__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__ja__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__ja__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__ja__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__ja__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__ja__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__ja__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__ja__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__ja__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__ja__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__ja__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
__ja__ I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
__ja__ Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
__ja__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__ja__ This is a Klein bottle .
__ja__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
__ja__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__ja__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
__ja__ It has wonderful properties .
__ja__ If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__ja__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__ja__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
__ja__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__ja__ This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__ja__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__ja__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__ja__ That was a month of my life .
__ja__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__ja__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__ja__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__ja__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__ja__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__ja__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
__ja__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__ja__ And it sent me back .
__ja__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__ja__ This guy over here of course is me .
__ja__ This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__ja__ Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__ja__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
__ja__ He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__ja__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__ja__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__ja__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__ja__ In the background , my bicycle .
__ja__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__ja__ Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
__ja__ We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__ja__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__ja__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
__ja__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
__ja__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__ja__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__ja__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__ja__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__ja__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__ja__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__ja__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
__ja__ I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
__ja__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__ja__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__ja__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
__ja__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__ja__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__ja__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
__ja__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__ja__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__ja__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__ja__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
__ja__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__ja__ You won &apos;t need to know trig .
__ja__ But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__ja__ None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
__ja__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__ja__ ( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__ja__ My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
__ja__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__ja__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__ja__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__ja__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__ja__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__ja__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__ja__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__ja__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__ja__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__ja__ But , probably — one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__ja__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__ja__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__ja__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__ja__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__ja__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__ja__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__ja__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__ja__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__ja__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__ja__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__ja__ It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
__ja__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__ja__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__ja__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__ja__ The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__ja__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__ja__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__ja__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__ja__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__ja__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__ja__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
__ja__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
__ja__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__ja__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
__ja__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
__ja__ But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__ja__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__ja__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__ja__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
__ja__ I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__ja__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
__ja__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__ja__ I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__ja__ Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
__ja__ And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
__ja__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__ja__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__ja__ He wants to clunk me over the head !
__ja__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
__ja__ It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
__ja__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__ja__ Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__ja__ Chases me into this room .
__ja__ The entranceway to the bell tower .
__ja__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__ja__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__ja__ I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
__ja__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__ja__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__ja__ I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
__ja__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__ja__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
__ja__ A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
__ja__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__ja__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__ja__ Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
__ja__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__ja__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__ja__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__ja__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__ja__ A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
__ja__ I had just driven home , it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter , I had been visiting my friend , Jeff , across town , and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees — and don &apos;t bother asking if that &apos;s Celsius or Fahrenheit , minus 40 is where the two scales meet — it was very cold .
__ja__ And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
__ja__ In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
__ja__ So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
__ja__ I thought about calling a locksmith — at least I had my cellphone , but at midnight , it could take a while for a locksmith to show up , and it was cold .
__ja__ I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase .
__ja__ So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it .
__ja__ This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even .
__ja__ Now , I &apos;m a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress .
__ja__ It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate , it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking .
__ja__ So the next morning , when I woke up on too little sleep , worrying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contractor , and the freezing temperatures , and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cortisol in my brain , my thinking was cloudy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport check-in counter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my passport . ( Laughter )
__ja__ So I raced home in the snow and ice , 40 minutes , got my passport , raced back to the airport , I made it just in time , but they had given away my seat to someone else , so I got stuck in the back of the plane , next to the bathrooms , in a seat that wouldn &apos;t recline , on an eight-hour flight .
__ja__ Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
__ja__ Or at least if bad things happen , will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe .
__ja__ So I started thinking about that , but my thoughts didn &apos;t crystallize until about a month later .
__ja__ I was having dinner with my colleague , Danny Kahneman , the Nobel Prize winner , and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window , and , you know , forgotten my passport , and Danny shared with me that he &apos;d been practicing something called prospective hindsight .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-mortem .
__ja__ Now , you all know what the postmortem is .
__ja__ Whenever there &apos;s a disaster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
__ja__ Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage .
__ja__ So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem .
__ja__ Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
__ja__ I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
__ja__ Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
__ja__ Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
__ja__ There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
__ja__ The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged .
__ja__ It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
__ja__ And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels , and they could still find their nuts .
__ja__ They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
__ja__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__ja__ So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
__ja__ So in the home , designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
__ja__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__ja__ For your reading glasses , a particular table .
__ja__ If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
__ja__ What about travel ?
__ja__ Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
__ja__ If these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .
__ja__ Now these are some rather obvious things .
__ja__ Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
__ja__ Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
__ja__ So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
__ja__ And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .
__ja__ And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
__ja__ And so I want to talk about that .
__ja__ And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
__ja__ But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , and social decision-making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts .
__ja__ So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
__ja__ Now , you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
__ja__ And so you &apos;re thinking having high cholesterol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doctor says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol , a statin . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve probably heard of statins , you know that they &apos;re among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today , you probably even know people who take them .
__ja__ And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! Give me the statin . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don &apos;t like talking about , and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less .
__ja__ It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
__ja__ Now , what is this , the NNT ?
__ja__ It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
__ja__ And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that ?
__ja__ The number should be one .
__ja__ My doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
__ja__ But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
__ja__ And it &apos;s not the doctor &apos;s fault , if it &apos;s anybody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s the fault of scientists like me .
__ja__ We haven &apos;t figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
__ja__ But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
__ja__ So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
__ja__ How many people have to take it before one person is helped ?
__ja__ 300 .
__ja__ This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband , independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
__ja__ I ran through the numbers myself .
__ja__ 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack , stroke or other adverse event is prevented .
__ja__ Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol .
__ja__ Why not , doc ? Give me the prescription anyway . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another statistic , and that is , &quot; &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__ja__ So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
__ja__ You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
__ja__ Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
__ja__ I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
__ja__ Medical ethics requires it , it &apos;s part of the principle of informed consent .
__ja__ You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not .
__ja__ Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pulled this number out of the air for shock value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .
__ja__ For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 .
__ja__ That &apos;s right , 49 surgeries are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
__ja__ And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
__ja__ They include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
__ja__ And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
__ja__ So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
__ja__ You don &apos;t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
__ja__ And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
__ja__ Because you have a choice oftentimes , do you I want a shorter life that &apos;s pain-free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end ?
__ja__ These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your loved ones .
__ja__ You might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you &apos;re practiced with this kind of thinking .
__ja__ Remember , our brain under stress releases cortisol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down .
__ja__ There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
__ja__ Face-to-face with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if you &apos;re body is expending metabolism on those things and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s lunch , and then none of those things matter .
__ja__ Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
__ja__ So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
__ja__ I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
__ja__ We all are going to fail now and then .
__ja__ The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
__ja__ Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I got back from my trip , I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .
__ja__ And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
__ja__ So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a gradual process , and I &apos;m getting there .
__ja__ Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ Good morning !
__ja__ Are you awake ?
__ja__ They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
__ja__ Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
__ja__ Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
__ja__ So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
__ja__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
__ja__ He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
__ja__ He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__ja__ He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
__ja__ What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
__ja__ Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
__ja__ How could she speak that way ?
__ja__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__ja__ It made me mad .
__ja__ It definitely hurts !
__ja__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__ja__ Where could this happen ?
__ja__ How did we get here ?
__ja__ Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
__ja__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__ja__ Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
__ja__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
__ja__ To be one of them ?
__ja__ Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
__ja__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__ja__ I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
__ja__ The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
__ja__ It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
__ja__ If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
__ja__ Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
__ja__ So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
__ja__ This is one reality .
__ja__ But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
__ja__ Arabic is the mother tongue .
__ja__ Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
__ja__ Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
__ja__ How ?
__ja__ Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
__ja__ All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
__ja__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
__ja__ Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
__ja__ You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
__ja__ So , this is an example no one can argue with .
__ja__ Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
__ja__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__ja__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__ja__ That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
__ja__ They make it sacred .
__ja__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__ja__ Do we know better than them ?
__ja__ All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
__ja__ Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
__ja__ They kept it close to them .
__ja__ Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
__ja__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__ja__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__ja__ So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
__ja__ If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this remind you of ?
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
__ja__ Regardless of the who , how and why .
__ja__ Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__ja__ Language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
__ja__ So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
__ja__ Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
__ja__ It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
__ja__ What is our intellect ?
__ja__ How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
__ja__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__ja__ How would you feel ?
__ja__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__ja__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__ja__ I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__ja__ I asked her once how things were going .
__ja__ She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; toqborni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; &quot; toqborni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
__ja__ He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
__ja__ Does she want to commit suicide ?
__ja__ &apos;Bury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
__ja__ It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
__ja__ She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
__ja__ Translate that for me .
__ja__ ( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
__ja__ We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
__ja__ Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
__ja__ Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
__ja__ The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
__ja__ We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
__ja__ And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
__ja__ We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
__ja__ In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
__ja__ So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
__ja__ Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
__ja__ After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
__ja__ You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
__ja__ Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
__ja__ We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
__ja__ If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
__ja__ We &apos;d have to find an existence .
__ja__ We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
__ja__ This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
__ja__ After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
__ja__ Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
__ja__ We are very cool !
__ja__ And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
__ja__ I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
__ja__ But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
__ja__ Creativity is the idea .
__ja__ So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
__ja__ At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
__ja__ Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
__ja__ Let &apos;s start from this moment .
__ja__ Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
__ja__ A single novel could make us global again .
__ja__ It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
__ja__ So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
__ja__ But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
__ja__ In conclusion , what can you do today ?
__ja__ Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
__ja__ Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
__ja__ But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
__ja__ ( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
__ja__ You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
__ja__ It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
__ja__ That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
__ja__ Second , there are many other things that we can do .
__ja__ We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
__ja__ We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
__ja__ Now I will tell you a secret .
__ja__ A baby first identifies its father through language .
__ja__ When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci , Maman , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe . ( Applause )
__ja__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__ja__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__ja__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__ja__ I want to know how I impact them .
__ja__ I want to know how they impact me .
__ja__ I want to know why they fish .
__ja__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__ja__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__ja__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__ja__ So what do we call this ?
__ja__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__ja__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
__ja__ Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
__ja__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__ja__ Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__ja__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__ja__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__ja__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__ja__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__ja__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__ja__ You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__ja__ Pole caught — no bycatch .
__ja__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
__ja__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__ja__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__ja__ Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
__ja__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__ja__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__ja__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__ja__ Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
__ja__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__ja__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__ja__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__ja__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__ja__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__ja__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__ja__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
__ja__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__ja__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__ja__ Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant .
__ja__ Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
__ja__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__ja__ Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__ja__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__ja__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__ja__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
__ja__ It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
__ja__ Whooo !
__ja__ This is an easy sell .
__ja__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__ja__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__ja__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__ja__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__ja__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__ja__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
__ja__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__ja__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__ja__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__ja__ So let &apos;s start there .
__ja__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__ja__ Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
__ja__ But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
__ja__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
__ja__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__ja__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__ja__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__ja__ Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__ja__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood .
__ja__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__ja__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__ja__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__ja__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__ja__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__ja__ A couple things happened .
__ja__ I made more money .
__ja__ People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
__ja__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__ja__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__ja__ They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
__ja__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__ja__ This is great .
__ja__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__ja__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
__ja__ Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
__ja__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__ja__ This is what we need to favor .
__ja__ This is what the green list says .
__ja__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__ja__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__ja__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__ja__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__ja__ Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
__ja__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__ja__ Put it on four plates .
__ja__ Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__ja__ Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__ja__ Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__ja__ I expect a lot from food .
__ja__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__ja__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
__ja__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__ja__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__ja__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__ja__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__ja__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__ja__ I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
__ja__ I get the meat sweats .
__ja__ It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
__ja__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__ja__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__ja__ Eat your vegetables .
__ja__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__ja__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__ja__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
__ja__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
__ja__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
__ja__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__ja__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__ja__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__ja__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__ja__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
__ja__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__ja__ We need to savor vegetables .
__ja__ We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
__ja__ And we need to save dinner .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ Hi . I am an architect .
__ja__ I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
__ja__ 1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
__ja__ It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
__ja__ Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
__ja__ This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
__ja__ There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
__ja__ As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
__ja__ In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
__ja__ Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
__ja__ I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
__ja__ So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
__ja__ My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
__ja__ My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
__ja__ After , the building was recycled .
__ja__ So that was the goal of my design .
__ja__ Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
__ja__ Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
__ja__ So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
__ja__ We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
__ja__ Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
__ja__ That was the problem .
__ja__ Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
__ja__ It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
__ja__ But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
__ja__ They have money and power .
__ja__ Those are invisible .
__ja__ So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
__ja__ That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
__ja__ So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
__ja__ But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
__ja__ For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
__ja__ That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
__ja__ Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
__ja__ So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
__ja__ We can make it better .
__ja__ So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
__ja__ 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
__ja__ Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
__ja__ Over two million people became refugees .
__ja__ But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
__ja__ They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
__ja__ But over two million people cut trees .
__ja__ It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
__ja__ That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
__ja__ Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
__ja__ So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
__ja__ We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
__ja__ And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
__ja__ Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
__ja__ And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
__ja__ So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
__ja__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
__ja__ After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
__ja__ I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
__ja__ They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
__ja__ So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
__ja__ I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
__ja__ I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
__ja__ The color coordination is very important .
__ja__ And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
__ja__ So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
__ja__ Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
__ja__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
__ja__ It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
__ja__ Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
__ja__ It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
__ja__ So this building became a permanent building .
__ja__ Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
__ja__ Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
__ja__ Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
__ja__ In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
__ja__ 2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
__ja__ In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
__ja__ And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
__ja__ I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
__ja__ I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
__ja__ In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
__ja__ It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
__ja__ In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
__ja__ And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
__ja__ And they are very kind , affording my model .
__ja__ I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
__ja__ So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
__ja__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
__ja__ Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
__ja__ Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
__ja__ This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
__ja__ After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
__ja__ But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
__ja__ People suffer mentally and physically .
__ja__ So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
__ja__ However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
__ja__ But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
__ja__ They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
__ja__ Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
__ja__ So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
__ja__ Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
__ja__ He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
__ja__ I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
__ja__ Many of the people want to stay here forever .
__ja__ I was very happy to hear that .
__ja__ Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
__ja__ About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
__ja__ And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
__ja__ So this is under construction .
__ja__ And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
__ja__ Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__ja__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__ja__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__ja__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
__ja__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__ja__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__ja__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__ja__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__ja__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__ja__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__ja__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__ja__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__ja__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
__ja__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__ja__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__ja__ What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
__ja__ Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__ja__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__ja__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__ja__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
__ja__ I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
__ja__ I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__ja__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__ja__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__ja__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__ja__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__ja__ On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__ja__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__ja__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__ja__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__ja__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__ja__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__ja__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__ja__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__ja__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__ja__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__ja__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
__ja__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__ja__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__ja__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__ja__ And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
__ja__ On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
__ja__ And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__ja__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__ja__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__ja__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__ja__ And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__ja__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__ja__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
__ja__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__ja__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__ja__ So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__ja__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__ja__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__ja__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__ja__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
__ja__ Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__ja__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
__ja__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__ja__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__ja__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__ja__ My son is 23 .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__ja__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__ja__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__ja__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__ja__ So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__ja__ You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
__ja__ And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__ja__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__ja__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__ja__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__ja__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__ja__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__ja__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__ja__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
__ja__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__ja__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__ja__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__ja__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__ja__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__ja__ And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__ja__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__ja__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__ja__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__ja__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__ja__ And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__ja__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__ja__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__ja__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__ja__ This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
__ja__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
__ja__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__ja__ Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__ja__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__ja__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
__ja__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__ja__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__ja__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
__ja__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__ja__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__ja__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__ja__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__ja__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__ja__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__ja__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__ja__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__ja__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__ja__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__ja__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__ja__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__ja__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__ja__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__ja__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__ja__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__ja__ Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
__ja__ What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
__ja__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__ja__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__ja__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__ja__ Same as the other side .
__ja__ Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__ja__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__ja__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__ja__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__ja__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__ja__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__ja__ Oh .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__ja__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__ja__ Not working either .
__ja__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__ja__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__ja__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__ja__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__ja__ So when you put four .
__ja__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__ja__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__ja__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__ja__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__ja__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__ja__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__ja__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__ja__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__ja__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__ja__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__ja__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__ja__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__ja__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__ja__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__ja__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__ja__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__ja__ So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
__ja__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__ja__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__ja__ So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
__ja__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__ja__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__ja__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__ja__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__ja__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__ja__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__ja__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
__ja__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__ja__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__ja__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__ja__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__ja__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__ja__ It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__ja__ We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
__ja__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__ja__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__ja__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__ja__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__ja__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__ja__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__ja__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__ja__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__ja__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__ja__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__ja__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__ja__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__ja__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__ja__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__ja__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__ja__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__ja__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__ja__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__ja__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__ja__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__ja__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__ja__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__ja__ They work in the field .
__ja__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__ja__ They have education programs .
__ja__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__ja__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__ja__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__ja__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__ja__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__ja__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__ja__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__ja__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__ja__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__ja__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__ja__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__ja__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__ja__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__ja__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__ja__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__ja__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__ja__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__ja__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__ja__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__ja__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__ja__ This can happen .
__ja__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__ja__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__ja__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__ja__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__ja__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__ja__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__ja__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__ja__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__ja__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__ja__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__ja__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__ja__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__ja__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__ja__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__ja__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__ja__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__ja__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__ja__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__ja__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__ja__ This is the transformation that took place .
__ja__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__ja__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__ja__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__ja__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__ja__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__ja__ Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__ja__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__ja__ The rocket was huge .
__ja__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__ja__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__ja__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__ja__ In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__ja__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__ja__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__ja__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__ja__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__ja__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__ja__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__ja__ All hell broke loose .
__ja__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__ja__ It provoked the missile gap .
__ja__ It exploded an arms race .
__ja__ It began the space race .
__ja__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__ja__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__ja__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__ja__ Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__ja__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__ja__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__ja__ Support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
__ja__ And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__ja__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
__ja__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__ja__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
__ja__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__ja__ ( Applause ) .
__ja__ Thank you , Chris .
__ja__ Today , a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells And announced that I &apos;m &quot; articulate &quot; Which means that when it comes to enunciation and diction I don &apos;t even think of it ‘ Cause I ’ m &quot; &quot; articulate &quot; &quot; So when my professor asks a question And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion There ’ s no misdirected intention Pay attention ‘ Cause I ’ m “ articulate ” So when my father asks , “ Wha ’ kinda ting is dis ? ” My “ articulate ” answer never goes amiss I say “ father , this is the impending problem at hand ” And when I ’ m on the block I switch it up just because I can
__ja__ So when my boy says , “ What ’ s good with you son ? ” I just say , “ I jus ’ fall out wit dem people but I done ! ” And sometimes in class I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask “ Yo ! Why dese books neva be about my peoples ” Yes , I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals Because I ’ m “ articulate ” But who controls articulation ?
__ja__ Because the English language is a multifaceted oration Subject to indefinite transformation Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English But I ’ m here to tell you that even “ articulate ” Americans sound foolish to the British So when my Professor comes on the block and says , “ Hello ” I stop him and say “ Noooo … You ’ re being inarticulate … the proper way is to say ‘ what ’ s good ’ ” Now you may think that ’ s too hood , that ’ s not cool But I ’ m here to tell you that even our language has rules So when Mommy mocks me and says “ ya ’ ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store ” I say “ Mommy , no , that sentence is not following the law
__ja__ Never does the word &quot; &quot; madd &quot; &quot; go before a present participle That ’ s simply the principle of this English ” If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop , From every suburbia , and every hood ‘ Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis Of this world saying “ it is good &quot; &quot; So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech But do not judge me by my language and assume That I ’ m too ignorant to teach ‘ Cause I speak three tongues One for each : Home , school and friends I ’ m a tri-lingual orator Sometimes I ’ m consistent with my language now
__ja__ Then switch it up so I don ’ t bore later Sometimes I fight back two tongues While I use the other one in the classroom And when I mistakenly mix them up I feel crazy like … I ’ m cooking in the bathroom I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen But you can ’ t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken These words are spoken By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history
__ja__ I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I ’ m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you ’ ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I ’ m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity So don ’ t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity As much as has been raped away from our people How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language As anything less than equal Let there be no confusion Let there be no hesitation
__ja__ This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That ’ s why I put &quot; &quot; tri-lingual &quot; &quot; on my last job application I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know And when they call me for the interview I ’ ll be more than happy to show that I can say : “ What ’ s good ” “ Whatagwan ” And of course … “ Hello ” Because I ’ m “ articulate ” Thank you .

__ja__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__ja__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__ja__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__ja__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__ja__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__ja__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__ja__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__ja__ Let me show you what I mean .
__ja__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__ja__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__ja__ All right . Very significant mark .
__ja__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__ja__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__ja__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__ja__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__ja__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__ja__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__ja__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__ja__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__ja__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__ja__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__ja__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__ja__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__ja__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__ja__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__ja__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__ja__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__ja__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__ja__ Wake up .
__ja__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__ja__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__ja__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__ja__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__ja__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__ja__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__ja__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__ja__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__ja__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__ja__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__ja__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__ja__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__ja__ The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
__ja__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__ja__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__ja__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
__ja__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__ja__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
__ja__ And the third is a little bit less obvious .
__ja__ Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
__ja__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__ja__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__ja__ I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
__ja__ My brothers and I dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
__ja__ He was livid , and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
__ja__ Later , I understood why my father got so upset .
__ja__ Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
__ja__ My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
__ja__ His was a lonely struggle , because Bihar was also India &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
__ja__ And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
__ja__ And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was famished and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
__ja__ Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
__ja__ This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
__ja__ I resolved to give back .
__ja__ Later , I joined the World Bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
__ja__ My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
__ja__ But after we disbursed the loans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
__ja__ It was Bihar all over again .
__ja__ Bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
__ja__ Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
__ja__ And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
__ja__ And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
__ja__ Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
__ja__ Open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__ja__ The first key shift is open knowledge .
__ja__ You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
__ja__ They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
__ja__ They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
__ja__ This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades today inspiring New York City .
__ja__ And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
__ja__ This is the second shift : open aid .
__ja__ Recently , the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
__ja__ Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
__ja__ Take GeoMapping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
__ja__ So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
__ja__ This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
__ja__ And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
__ja__ From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
__ja__ Are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
__ja__ So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
__ja__ But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
__ja__ This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
__ja__ To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
__ja__ In this map from Moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
__ja__ Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
__ja__ So in the Philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__ja__ And the government is responsive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action .
__ja__ And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
__ja__ In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
__ja__ This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
__ja__ And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
__ja__ Today , even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
__ja__ But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
__ja__ These are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
__ja__ So for instance , today , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
__ja__ These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar .
__ja__ Two years ago , on April 8th , 2010 , I called my father .
__ja__ It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
__ja__ Though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . He won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
__ja__ He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
__ja__ These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
__ja__ Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
__ja__ We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
__ja__ We need to accelerate these shifts .
__ja__ If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , in Uganda , and beyond .
__ja__ We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
__ja__ We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
__ja__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__ja__ So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
__ja__ Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
__ja__ That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
__ja__ 6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
__ja__ Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
__ja__ Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn &apos;t some smart , new technological innovations .
__ja__ It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
__ja__ Washing hands with soap , a habit we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by one third .
__ja__ Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , trachoma , SARS , and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap .
__ja__ Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
__ja__ It stops babies from dying .
__ja__ Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
__ja__ It can save over 600,000 children every year .
__ja__ That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
__ja__ I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
__ja__ So now just take a minute .
__ja__ I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
__ja__ Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
__ja__ Please shake their hands .
__ja__ All right , get to know each other .
__ja__ They look really pretty .
__ja__ All right .
__ja__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__ja__ Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
__ja__ Well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
__ja__ And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fancy toilets , running water , and soap available , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high .
__ja__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__ja__ Actually , soap is available .
__ja__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__ja__ Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
__ja__ So why is it ?
__ja__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__ja__ Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__ja__ Well , in Mayank &apos;s family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
__ja__ His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cupboard .
__ja__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__ja__ On average , in Mayank &apos;s family , they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap .
__ja__ What &apos;s the result of that ?
__ja__ Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
__ja__ Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
__ja__ Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
__ja__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__ja__ I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life .
__ja__ However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
__ja__ Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
__ja__ Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand .
__ja__ Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
__ja__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__ja__ Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
__ja__ Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__ja__ And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
__ja__ Just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap .
__ja__ The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
__ja__ But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera .
__ja__ Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment .
__ja__ A hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
__ja__ I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
__ja__ Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
__ja__ The budget is not always there .
__ja__ And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
__ja__ In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap .
__ja__ We have friends like USAID , the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap , London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , Plan , WaterAid , that all believe for a win-win-win partnership .
__ja__ Win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
__ja__ Win for the private sector , because we build new generations of future handwashers .
__ja__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__ja__ On October 15 , we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day .
__ja__ Schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world &apos;s most important public health intervention .
__ja__ What &apos;s required , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , creative thinking that drives advocacy .
__ja__ If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign , we &apos;ve created great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them .
__ja__ We &apos;ve had over 30 million views .
__ja__ Most of these discussions are still happening online .
__ja__ I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
__ja__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__ja__ I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
__ja__ I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
__ja__ I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
__ja__ We run today the world &apos;s largest handwashing program by any public health standards .
__ja__ We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
__ja__ My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
__ja__ Over the last four years , business has grown double digits , whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased .
__ja__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__ja__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__ja__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__ja__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__ja__ This one is from Myanmar .
__ja__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__ja__ Her son , Myo , is her second one .
__ja__ She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks , and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life , and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant , and that if soap is used before touching the babies , we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers .
__ja__ And that &apos;s what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equip her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn .
__ja__ And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap .
__ja__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__ja__ I hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like Myo reach their fifth birthday .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
__ja__ They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
__ja__ We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
__ja__ The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
__ja__ Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
__ja__ These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
__ja__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__ja__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__ja__ Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities , when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army .
__ja__ The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__ja__ Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
__ja__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__ja__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__ja__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__ja__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__ja__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__ja__ These items are recovered from numerous mass graves , and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust .
__ja__ Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
__ja__ Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
__ja__ Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
__ja__ These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
__ja__ Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
__ja__ Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orphans of the narrative .
__ja__ Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
__ja__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__ja__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__ja__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__ja__ And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
__ja__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__ja__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__ja__ Once all the missing persons are identified , only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain .
__ja__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__ja__ Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ But that can &apos;t be right .
__ja__ I am for chocolate donuts .
__ja__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__ja__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
__ja__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__ja__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__ja__ It &apos;s awful .
__ja__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__ja__ Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
__ja__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__ja__ So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
__ja__ A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__ja__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__ja__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__ja__ And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
__ja__ This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
__ja__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__ja__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__ja__ To give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
__ja__ That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
__ja__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__ja__ And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
__ja__ So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
__ja__ The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
__ja__ The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
__ja__ So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
__ja__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__ja__ One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
__ja__ And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
__ja__ So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
__ja__ So here &apos;s a video .
__ja__ You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
__ja__ But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
__ja__ That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
__ja__ The next work is Decoy .
__ja__ This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
__ja__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__ja__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__ja__ So here is the first test scenario .
__ja__ You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
__ja__ But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy .
__ja__ It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__ja__ Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
__ja__ And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
__ja__ The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
__ja__ In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
__ja__ So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
__ja__ Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
__ja__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__ja__ This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
__ja__ So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
__ja__ It could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
__ja__ It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
__ja__ So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
__ja__ So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
__ja__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
__ja__ It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
__ja__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__ja__ So here &apos;s a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
__ja__ And here is a prototype .
__ja__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
__ja__ Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
__ja__ It comes out of the idea of a window .
__ja__ This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
__ja__ So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
__ja__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__ja__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__ja__ Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
__ja__ So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
__ja__ So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they &apos;re oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
__ja__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__ja__ These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
__ja__ So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
__ja__ So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
__ja__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__ja__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__ja__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ And I would want to do that like that .
__ja__ That would be the plan .
__ja__ I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
__ja__ But then came my 90-page senior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
__ja__ And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
__ja__ It was way too big a project .
__ja__ This is how the year would go .
__ja__ But then , the funniest thing happened .
__ja__ Those first few months ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
__ja__ And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
__ja__ It was a very , very bad thesis . ( Laughter )
__ja__ No , no , it was very , very bad .
__ja__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__ja__ Now , what does this mean for the procrastinator ?
__ja__ Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
__ja__ He lives entirely in the present moment .
__ja__ He has no memory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only cares about two things : easy and fun .
__ja__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And to the Monkey , humans are just another animal species .
__ja__ We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , and the Monkey does not know what that is .
__ja__ We can visualize the future .
__ja__ We can see the big picture .
__ja__ And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
__ja__ And importantly , he &apos;s the only thing the Monkey is terrified of .
__ja__ As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
__ja__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__ja__ This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
__ja__ Why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
__ja__ It &apos;s usually suffered quietly and privately .
__ja__ It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cramming for some project .
__ja__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastinators .
__ja__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__ja__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__ja__ We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastinating on , because everyone is procrastinating on something in life .
__ja__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) You know .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ There &apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
__ja__ On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
__ja__ The column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
__ja__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
__ja__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__ja__ It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck .
__ja__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__ja__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__ja__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__ja__ There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?
__ja__ You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
__ja__ In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
__ja__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__ja__ So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
__ja__ And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
__ja__ These better people are attracted to this concept of service .
__ja__ But that &apos;s completely wrong .
__ja__ What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
__ja__ I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
__ja__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__ja__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__ja__ So trust and cooperation are really important here .
__ja__ The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
__ja__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__ja__ I can &apos;t simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
__ja__ It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
__ja__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__ja__ If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
__ja__ Nothing personal .
__ja__ Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
__ja__ And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
__ja__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__ja__ There are inherent benefits to this .
__ja__ It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
__ja__ If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , that means you won &apos;t watch for danger .
__ja__ Bad system of survival .
__ja__ The modern day is exactly the same thing .
__ja__ The world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
__ja__ It could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
__ja__ It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
__ja__ Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
__ja__ It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
__ja__ We have no control over these forces .
__ja__ These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
__ja__ The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
__ja__ When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong , remarkable things happen .
__ja__ I was flying on a trip , and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called , and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
__ja__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__ja__ So I said something .
__ja__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__ja__ Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
__ja__ She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
__ja__ she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
__ja__ The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
__ja__ It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
__ja__ You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weakens the organization .
__ja__ When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
__ja__ The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
__ja__ If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
__ja__ We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
__ja__ Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
__ja__ They want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipline when necessary , build their self-confidence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
__ja__ Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
__ja__ We would never do it .
__ja__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__ja__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__ja__ If you get a job at Next Jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
__ja__ In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
__ja__ It &apos;s the complete opposite .
__ja__ This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
__ja__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__ja__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__ja__ They have violated this deep-seated social contract .
__ja__ We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
__ja__ This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
__ja__ Would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to Gandhi ?
__ja__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
__ja__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__ja__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__ja__ the people to save the numbers .
__ja__ They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
__ja__ Bob Chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
__ja__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__ja__ They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed layoffs .
__ja__ And Bob refused .
__ja__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__ja__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__ja__ And so they came up with a furlough program .
__ja__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
__ja__ They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
__ja__ But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much .
__ja__ He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot , and morale went up .
__ja__ They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
__ja__ And quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
__ja__ Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
__ja__ People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
__ja__ Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
__ja__ I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
__ja__ They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
__ja__ And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
__ja__ This is what a leader is .
__ja__ I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
__ja__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__ja__ We call them leaders because they go first .
__ja__ We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
__ja__ We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
__ja__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__ja__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__ja__ And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
__ja__ Thank you very much .
__ja__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__ja__ The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
__ja__ As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
__ja__ I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ruth Tichauer , a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes .
__ja__ That is how I grew up : encouraged to see beyond any limitation .
__ja__ So part of my education included helping her in remote , indigenous communities .
__ja__ I cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
__ja__ During those trips , my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
__ja__ Go and look behind the Mountains .
__ja__ Something lost behind the mountains .
__ja__ Lost and waiting for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medical student .
__ja__ One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
__ja__ There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
__ja__ The problem starts during pregnancy .
__ja__ The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
__ja__ Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
__ja__ At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
__ja__ It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
__ja__ But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
__ja__ As you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
__ja__ Video : ( Baby crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they seem desperate to breathe .
__ja__ To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
__ja__ One night , my friend Malte , were camping in the Amazon region .
__ja__ The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
__ja__ Then came a moment of inspiration .
__ja__ So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
__ja__ The holes in children &apos;s hearts can be closed with it .
__ja__ A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
__ja__ It maybe doesn &apos;t look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
__ja__ In this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
__ja__ The coil then closes the hole .
__ja__ After that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
__ja__ In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
__ja__ The coil , if it works , can save lives .
__ja__ I returned from Germany to Bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
__ja__ With my wife and partner , Dr. Alexandra Heath , we started to see patients .
__ja__ After successfully treating patients with our coil , we felt really enthusiastic .
__ja__ But we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high .
__ja__ And , the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition .
__ja__ The hole in altitude patients is different , because the orifice between the arteries is larger .
__ja__ Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time , and they die .
__ja__ The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia .
__ja__ The search started again .
__ja__ We went back to the drawing board .
__ja__ After many trials , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
__ja__ For centuries , indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms , and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device .
__ja__ We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape .
__ja__ It seems this time , the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn &apos;t rust because it &apos;s made of only one piece .
__ja__ It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
__ja__ As you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
__ja__ Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
__ja__ Our device expands , places itself and closes the hole .
__ja__ We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
__ja__ No open surgery was necessary .
__ja__ ( Applause ) As doctors , we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal — if they do .
__ja__ This is the child from before , after the procedure .
__ja__ As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent healed .
__ja__ From start to finish , the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes .
__ja__ That &apos;s very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
__ja__ We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us .
__ja__ Together , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
__ja__ We lost the fear of creating something new .
__ja__ The path , it &apos;s not easy .
__ja__ Many obstacles arise all the time .
__ja__ But we receive strength from our patients .
__ja__ Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
__ja__ Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
__ja__ So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
__ja__ We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
__ja__ We are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
__ja__ This whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it , really : No child is left behind .
__ja__ Muchas gracias .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
__ja__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
__ja__ The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
__ja__ So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__ja__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__ja__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__ja__ Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
__ja__ Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
__ja__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
__ja__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__ja__ and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
__ja__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__ja__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__ja__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
__ja__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__ja__ So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
__ja__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__ja__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__ja__ So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
__ja__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__ja__ And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
__ja__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__ja__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__ja__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__ja__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
__ja__ DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
__ja__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__ja__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__ja__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__ja__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause . )
__ja__ Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
__ja__ I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
__ja__ There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
__ja__ The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
__ja__ So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
__ja__ Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
__ja__ It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
__ja__ And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
__ja__ In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
__ja__ In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
__ja__ In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
__ja__ After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
__ja__ You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
__ja__ So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
__ja__ And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
__ja__ So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
__ja__ At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
__ja__ And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
__ja__ Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
__ja__ We call this value-based healthcare .
__ja__ On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
__ja__ This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
__ja__ On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
__ja__ When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
__ja__ You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
__ja__ The differences were dramatic .
__ja__ Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
__ja__ Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
__ja__ If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
__ja__ You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
__ja__ If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
__ja__ Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
__ja__ That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
__ja__ When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
__ja__ But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
__ja__ And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
__ja__ Nobody knows .
__ja__ So going the hospital is a lottery .
__ja__ Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
__ja__ In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
__ja__ To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
__ja__ They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
__ja__ They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
__ja__ So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
__ja__ &quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
__ja__ And they finally agreed .
__ja__ And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
__ja__ Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
__ja__ They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
__ja__ Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
__ja__ Since then , they publish every year .
__ja__ Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
__ja__ And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
__ja__ For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
__ja__ Now I found this principle really exciting .
__ja__ So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
__ja__ Continuous improvement .
__ja__ Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
__ja__ That &apos;s exciting in itself .
__ja__ But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
__ja__ So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
__ja__ They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
__ja__ In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
__ja__ So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
__ja__ Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
__ja__ We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
__ja__ OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
__ja__ The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
__ja__ Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
__ja__ That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
__ja__ Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
__ja__ This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
__ja__ The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
__ja__ In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
__ja__ The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
__ja__ Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
__ja__ They were always best in class .
__ja__ We were always best in class .
__ja__ And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
__ja__ But most of them don &apos;t know .
__ja__ But physicians have another characteristic .
__ja__ They actually thrive from peer recognition .
__ja__ If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
__ja__ They will share the information on how to improve .
__ja__ So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
__ja__ Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
__ja__ This is happening in reality .
__ja__ We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
__ja__ Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
__ja__ You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
__ja__ It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
__ja__ We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
__ja__ They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
__ja__ The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
__ja__ That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
__ja__ Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
__ja__ In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
__ja__ Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
__ja__ Why is that ?
__ja__ Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
__ja__ They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
__ja__ This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
__ja__ The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
__ja__ Can we measure it better than we do ?
__ja__ We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
__ja__ And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
__ja__ There was an enormous energy in the room .
__ja__ There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
__ja__ At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
__ja__ He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ja__ Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
__ja__ I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
__ja__ If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup , you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible .
__ja__ You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
__ja__ But if the startup organization is so great , why do so many fail ?
__ja__ That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
__ja__ I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success .
__ja__ And I wanted to try to be systematic about it , avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years .
__ja__ I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been starting businesses since I was 12 years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school , to high school , when I made solar energy devices , to college , when I made loudspeakers .
__ja__ And when I graduated from college , I started software companies .
__ja__ We learned a lot from those failures .
__ja__ So I looked at these five .
__ja__ First , the idea .
__ja__ I used to think that the idea was everything .
__ja__ I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
__ja__ But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the execution , adaptability , that mattered even more than the idea .
__ja__ I never thought I &apos;d be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everybody has a plan , until they get punched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well .
__ja__ So much about a team &apos;s execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer .
__ja__ The customer is the true reality .
__ja__ And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
__ja__ Then I started looking at the business model .
__ja__ Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
__ja__ That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
__ja__ Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
__ja__ And then of course , the timing .
__ja__ Is the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
__ja__ Is it early , as in , you &apos;re in advance and you have to educate the world ?
__ja__ Is it just right ?
__ja__ Or is it too late , and there &apos;s already too many competitors ?
__ja__ So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies .
__ja__ And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies , and 100 non-Idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it .
__ja__ So first , on these Idealab companies , the top five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — those all became billion-dollar successes .
__ja__ And the five companies on the bottom — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we all had high hopes for , but didn &apos;t succeed .
__ja__ So I tried to rank across all of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions .
__ja__ And then for non-Idealab companies , I looked at wild successes , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn .
__ja__ And some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Friendster .
__ja__ The bottom companies had intense funding , they even had business models in some cases , but they didn &apos;t succeed .
__ja__ I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies , and the results really surprised me .
__ja__ The number one thing was timing .
__ja__ Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
__ja__ Team and execution came in second , and the idea , the differentiability of the idea , the uniqueness of the idea , that actually came in third .
__ja__ Now , this isn &apos;t absolutely definitive , it &apos;s not to say that the idea isn &apos;t important , but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important thing .
__ja__ Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed .
__ja__ The last two , business model and funding , made sense to me actually .
__ja__ I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you &apos;re creating .
__ja__ And funding , I think as well , if you &apos;re underfunded at first but you &apos;re gaining traction , especially in today &apos;s age , it &apos;s very , very easy to get intense funding .
__ja__ So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these .
__ja__ So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about .
__ja__ Well , that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger . &quot;
__ja__ Of course , people proved that wrong .
__ja__ But one of the reasons it succeeded , aside from a good business model , a good idea , great execution , is the timing .
__ja__ That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money , and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger .
__ja__ Same thing with Uber .
__ja__ Uber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too .
__ja__ But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system .
__ja__ Drivers were looking for extra money ; it was very , very important .
__ja__ Some of our early successes , Citysearch , came out when people needed web pages .
__ja__ GoTo.com , which we announced actually at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic .
__ja__ We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the timing was probably maybe more important .
__ja__ And then some of our failures .
__ja__ We started a company called Z.com , it was an online entertainment company .
__ja__ We were so excited about it — we raised enough money , we had a great business model , we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company .
__ja__ But broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000 .
__ja__ It was too hard to watch video content online , you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff , and the company eventually went out of business in 2003 .
__ja__ Just two years later , when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America , YouTube was perfectly timed .
__ja__ Great idea , but unbelievable timing .
__ja__ In fact , YouTube didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started .
__ja__ It wasn &apos;t even certain that that would work out .
__ja__ But that was beautifully , beautifully timed .
__ja__ So what I would say , in summary , is execution definitely matters a lot .
__ja__ The idea matters a lot .
__ja__ But timing might matter even more .
__ja__ And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them .
__ja__ And to be really , really honest about it , not be in denial about any results that you see , because if you have something you love , you want to push it forward , but you have to be very , very honest about that factor on timing .
__ja__ As I said earlier , I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place .
__ja__ I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio , and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn &apos;t have happened otherwise .
__ja__ Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__ja__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__ja__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__ja__ I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
__ja__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__ja__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__ja__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__ja__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__ja__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__ja__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__ja__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__ja__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__ja__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__ja__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__ja__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__ja__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__ja__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__ja__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__ja__ You see that glass of water ?
__ja__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__ja__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__ja__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__ja__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__ja__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__ja__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__ja__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__ja__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__ja__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__ja__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__ja__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__ja__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__ja__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__ja__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__ja__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__ja__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__ja__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__ja__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__ja__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__ja__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__ja__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__ja__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__ja__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__ja__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__ja__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__ja__ The light never goes out .
__ja__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__ja__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__ja__ Or is it photography ?
__ja__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__ja__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__ja__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__ja__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__ja__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__ja__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__ja__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__ja__ Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__ja__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__ja__ And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
__ja__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__ja__ When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
__ja__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__ja__ Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__ja__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__ja__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__ja__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__ja__ Is it something about the light ?
__ja__ What creates the illusion ?
__ja__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__ja__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__ja__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__ja__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__ja__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__ja__ And let me show you a simple example .
__ja__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__ja__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__ja__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__ja__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__ja__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__ja__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__ja__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__ja__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__ja__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__ja__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__ja__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__ja__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__ja__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__ja__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__ja__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__ja__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__ja__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__ja__ So here &apos;s another example .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__ja__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__ja__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__ja__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__ja__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__ja__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__ja__ The shores are from a different location .
__ja__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__ja__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__ja__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__ja__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__ja__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__ja__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__ja__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__ja__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned .
__ja__ We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies .
__ja__ There &apos;s been allegations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cellist .
__ja__ And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents .
__ja__ Now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel .
__ja__ It seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
__ja__ Why should we care about this ?
__ja__ But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .
__ja__ Now , for my organization Global Witness , this exposé has been phenomenal .
__ja__ We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets — something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
__ja__ Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
__ja__ I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll .
__ja__ It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients .
__ja__ I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
__ja__ It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
__ja__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__ja__ How does this actually work ?
__ja__ So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms .
__ja__ Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
__ja__ These were all preliminary meetings , and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system .
__ja__ It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
__ja__ This is about how a system works , that entrenches corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
__ja__ And in order to tackle this , we need to change the game .
__ja__ This may seem like doom and gloom , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be rich and powerful individuals .
__ja__ But as a natural optimist , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
__ja__ One of the things that is sad is that , actually , the US is lagging behind .
__ja__ So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
__ja__ For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
__ja__ We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Secrecy like this is not good for business . &quot;
__ja__ We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
__ja__ Together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
__ja__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__ja__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__ja__ Can that possibly be true ?
__ja__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__ja__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__ja__ CA : How does it work ?
__ja__ How do people release the documents ?
__ja__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__ja__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__ja__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__ja__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__ja__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__ja__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__ja__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__ja__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__ja__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__ja__ If we can have this document up ...
__ja__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__ja__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__ja__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__ja__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__ja__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__ja__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__ja__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__ja__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__ja__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__ja__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__ja__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__ja__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__ja__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__ja__ And so it came in from the outside .
__ja__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__ja__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__ja__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__ja__ JA : Yep .
__ja__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__ja__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__ja__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__ja__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__ja__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__ja__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__ja__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__ja__ Light &apos; em all up .
__ja__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__ja__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__ja__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__ja__ we need to move , time now !
__ja__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__ja__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__ja__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__ja__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__ja__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__ja__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__ja__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__ja__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__ja__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__ja__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__ja__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__ja__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__ja__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__ja__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__ja__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__ja__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__ja__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__ja__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__ja__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__ja__ I mean , did he ?
__ja__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__ja__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__ja__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__ja__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__ja__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__ja__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__ja__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__ja__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__ja__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__ja__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__ja__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__ja__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__ja__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__ja__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__ja__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__ja__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__ja__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__ja__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__ja__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__ja__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__ja__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__ja__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__ja__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__ja__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__ja__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__ja__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__ja__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__ja__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__ja__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__ja__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__ja__ Light is good .
__ja__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__ja__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__ja__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__ja__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__ja__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__ja__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__ja__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__ja__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__ja__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__ja__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__ja__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__ja__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__ja__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__ja__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__ja__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__ja__ What is this ?
__ja__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__ja__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__ja__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__ja__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__ja__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__ja__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__ja__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__ja__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__ja__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__ja__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__ja__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__ja__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__ja__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__ja__ Yeah .
__ja__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__ja__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__ja__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__ja__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__ja__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__ja__ That &apos;s a problem .
__ja__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__ja__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__ja__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__ja__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__ja__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__ja__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__ja__ Can that be right ?
__ja__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__ja__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__ja__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__ja__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__ja__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__ja__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__ja__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__ja__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__ja__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__ja__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__ja__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__ja__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__ja__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__ja__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__ja__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__ja__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__ja__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__ja__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__ja__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__ja__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__ja__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__ja__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__ja__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__ja__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__ja__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__ja__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__ja__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__ja__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__ja__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__ja__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__ja__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__ja__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__ja__ CA : Wow .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__ja__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__ja__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__ja__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__ja__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__ja__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__ja__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__ja__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__ja__ As a matter of fact , I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House , and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago .
__ja__ This little boy is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; Daddy , when I grow up , I want to be a former president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great blessing as a former president , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe .
__ja__ Not only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have visited more than 145 countries in the world , and the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth .
__ja__ And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa .
__ja__ So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is , strangely , not addressed quite often , is the abuse of women and girls .
__ja__ ( Applause ) There are a couple of reasons for this that I &apos;ll mention to begin with .
__ja__ First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures , holy scriptures , in the Bible , Old Testament , New Testament , Quran and so forth , and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques .
__ja__ And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God .
__ja__ This is a very serious problem . It &apos;s ordinarily not addressed .
__ja__ A number of years ago , in the year 2000 , I had been a Baptist , a Southern Baptist for 70 years — I tell you , I still teach Sunday school every Sunday ; I &apos;ll be teaching this Sunday as well — but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position , a subservient position to men .
__ja__ So they issued an edict , in effect , that prevents women from being priests , pastors , deacons in the church , or chaplains in the military , and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary , they cannot teach if a boy is in the room , because you can find verses in the Bible , there &apos;s over 30,000 verses in the Bible , that say that a woman shouldn &apos;t teach a man , and so forth .
__ja__ But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position .
__ja__ That is an all-pervasive problem , because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer , for instance , wants to cheat women , they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God , why should I treat them as equals myself ?
__ja__ Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work ?
__ja__ The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence , and that is increasing tremendously around the world .
__ja__ In the United States of America , for instance , we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people , mostly black people and minorities , by putting them in prison .
__ja__ When I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
__ja__ Nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
__ja__ That &apos;s a sevenfold increase .
__ja__ And since I left the White House , there &apos;s been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison .
__ja__ We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country .
__ja__ And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty .
__ja__ We &apos;re in California now , and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting 13 people for the death penalty .
__ja__ If you add that up , that &apos;s 307 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed .
__ja__ Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty , because it costs so much . ( Applause ) So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women .
__ja__ Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most , and I &apos;ll be fairly brief , because I have a limited amount of time , as you know .
__ja__ One is genital mutilation .
__ja__ Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very soon in her life , her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and , in a non-sterilized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman &apos;s genitalia .
__ja__ And sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate .
__ja__ And then later , when she gets married , the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex .
__ja__ This is not a rare thing , although it &apos;s against the law in most countries .
__ja__ In Egypt , for instance , 91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way .
__ja__ In some countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity .
__ja__ This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries .
__ja__ Another very serious thing is honor killings , where a family with misinterpretation , again , of a holy scripture — there &apos;s nothing in the Quran that mandates this — will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve , or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing .
__ja__ And this is done by members of her own family , so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family .
__ja__ An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father , the uncle or the brother , but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women .
__ja__ Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery , or human trafficking it &apos;s called nowadays .
__ja__ There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century .
__ja__ There are 30 million people now living in slavery .
__ja__ The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year , and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery , and that 80 percent of those sold are women , into sexual slavery .
__ja__ In the United States right this moment , 60,000 people are living in human bondage , or slavery .
__ja__ Atlanta , Georgia , where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into slavery every month .
__ja__ It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
__ja__ Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world , and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere .
__ja__ If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin , they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
__ja__ A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that , and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $ 35,000 per slave .
__ja__ The sex trade in Atlanta , Georgia , exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta , Georgia .
__ja__ So this is another very serious problem , and the basic problem is prostitution , because there &apos;s not a whorehouse in America that &apos;s not known by the local officials , the local policemen , or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth .
__ja__ And this leads to one of the worst problems , and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world .
__ja__ Sweden has got a good approach to it .
__ja__ About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery , but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted , and — ( Applause ) — prostitution has gone down .
__ja__ In the United States , we take just the opposite position .
__ja__ For every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
__ja__ Canada , Ireland , I &apos;ve already said Sweden , France , and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model .
__ja__ That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
__ja__ We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire : our military and our great university system .
__ja__ In the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place .
__ja__ The last report I got , there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military — 26,000 .
__ja__ Only 3,000 , not much more than 1 percent , are actually prosecuted , and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization — a ship like my submarine , or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines — the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not , and of course , the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command , sexual assaults are taking place , so they do not do it .
__ja__ That law needs to be changed .
__ja__ About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates , and this is now getting a lot of publicity , partially because of my book , but other things , and so 89 universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault .
__ja__ The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists , because outside of the university system , if they rape somebody , they &apos;ll be prosecuted , but when they get on a university campus , they can rape with impunity .
__ja__ They &apos;re not prosecuted .
__ja__ Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
__ja__ Another thing that &apos;s very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is sometimes misinterpreted , but for full-time employment , a woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man .
__ja__ When I became president , the difference was 39 percent .
__ja__ So we &apos;ve made some progress , partially because I was president and so forth — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years .
__ja__ These are the kind of things that go on .
__ja__ If you take the Fortune 500 companies , 23 of them have women CEOs , out of 500 , and those CEOs , I need not tell you , make less on an average than the other CEOs .
__ja__ Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country .
__ja__ Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth .
__ja__ We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War .
__ja__ Sometimes , we &apos;ve had soldiers on the ground fighting .
__ja__ The other times , we &apos;ve been flying overhead dropping bombs on people .
__ja__ Other times , of course , now , we have drones that attack people and so forth .
__ja__ We &apos;ve been at war with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War .
__ja__ There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t drop a bomb , we didn &apos;t launch a missile , we didn &apos;t fire a bullet .
__ja__ But anyway , those kinds of things , the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes , are the basic causes , of abuse of women and girls .
__ja__ There &apos;s one more basic cause that I need not mention , and that is that in general , men don &apos;t give a damn .
__ja__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
__ja__ The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy , and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child , when separate but equal had existed .
__ja__ Racial discrimination , legally , had existed for 100 years , from 1865 at the end of the War Between the States , the Civil War , all the way up to the 1960s , when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights .
__ja__ But during that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that racial discrimination was okay , but they stayed quiet , because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs , unique access to jury duty , better schools , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that exists today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care .
__ja__ Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against discrimination against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they enjoy a privileged position .
__ja__ And it &apos;s very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system , the majority of men that control the military system , the majority of men that control the governments of the world , and the majority of men that control the great religions .
__ja__ So what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
__ja__ I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one , and where you come from , Europe and so forth , who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act , need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world .
__ja__ The average woman in Egypt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth .
__ja__ I didn &apos;t even go down to detail about that .
__ja__ But I hope that out of this conference , that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market , need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters .
__ja__ I have 12 grandchildren , four children , and 10 great-grandchildren , and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America , not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country , in having equal rights , and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights .
__ja__ Thank you very much .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__ja__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__ja__ I will not dance to that beating .
__ja__ I know that beat .
__ja__ It is lifeless .
__ja__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__ja__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__ja__ I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
__ja__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__ja__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__ja__ I will not kill for you .
__ja__ Especially I will not die for you .
__ja__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__ja__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__ja__ Everyone can be wrong .
__ja__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__ja__ I will not forget where I come from .
__ja__ I will craft my own drum .
__ja__ Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
__ja__ Our humming will be drumming .
__ja__ I will not be played .
__ja__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__ja__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__ja__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__ja__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
__ja__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__ja__ ( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
__ja__ Confused , aspiring pacifists .
__ja__ I understand .
__ja__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__ja__ Like a lot .
__ja__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__ja__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
__ja__ What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__ja__ Poetry does that .
__ja__ It preps you . It aims you .
__ja__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__ja__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__ja__ Hold her now with you .
__ja__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__ja__ Are you holding her ?
__ja__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__ja__ Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
__ja__ But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__ja__ Whose son shall it be ?
__ja__ Which male child will perish a new day ?
__ja__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
__ja__ We cherish corpses .
__ja__ We mourn women , complicated .
__ja__ Bitches get beat daily .
__ja__ Profits made , prophets ignored .
__ja__ War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
__ja__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__ja__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__ja__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__ja__ Rhythm is half silence .
__ja__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__ja__ Sickness , health , tender violence .
__ja__ I think now I never was pure .
__ja__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am .
__ja__ Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
__ja__ I never was pure .
__ja__ Girl spoiled before ripened .
__ja__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__ja__ I experience exponentially .
__ja__ Everything is everything .
__ja__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__ja__ One woman loses six .
__ja__ One woman loses her head .
__ja__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__ja__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__ja__ One woman straps herself .
__ja__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__ja__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__ja__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__ja__ One woman never did .
__ja__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__ja__ Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__ja__ Faced with absence .
__ja__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
__ja__ My spine curves spiral .
__ja__ Precipice running to and running from human beings .
__ja__ Cluster bombs left behind .
__ja__ De facto landmines .
__ja__ A smoldering grief .
__ja__ Harvest contaminated tobacco .
__ja__ Harvest bombs .
__ja__ Harvest baby teeth .
__ja__ Harvest palms , smoke .
__ja__ Harvest witness , smoke .
__ja__ Resolutions , smoke .
__ja__ Salvation , smoke .
__ja__ Redemption , smoke .
__ja__ Breathe .
__ja__ Do not fear what has blown up .
__ja__ If you must , fear the unexploded .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__ja__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__ja__ Global famine was inevitable .
__ja__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
__ja__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__ja__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__ja__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__ja__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__ja__ Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__ja__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__ja__ Per-capita food production is up by a third .
__ja__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__ja__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__ja__ How did we achieve that ?
__ja__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
__ja__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__ja__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__ja__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__ja__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__ja__ These are both real objects .
__ja__ One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__ja__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__ja__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__ja__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__ja__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__ja__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__ja__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__ja__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__ja__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__ja__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__ja__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__ja__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__ja__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__ja__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__ja__ The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__ja__ And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__ja__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__ja__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__ja__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__ja__ They &apos;ve come together .
__ja__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__ja__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__ja__ In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__ja__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__ja__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
__ja__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__ja__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__ja__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__ja__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__ja__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__ja__ No other animal does it .
__ja__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__ja__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__ja__ You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
__ja__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__ja__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__ja__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__ja__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__ja__ Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__ja__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__ja__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__ja__ Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
__ja__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__ja__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__ja__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__ja__ So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
__ja__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__ja__ He can make his own spears and axes .
__ja__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__ja__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
__ja__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__ja__ And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__ja__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__ja__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__ja__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__ja__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__ja__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__ja__ You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
__ja__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__ja__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__ja__ And the answer is about half a second .
__ja__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__ja__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__ja__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__ja__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__ja__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__ja__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__ja__ It was self-sufficiency .
__ja__ We call that poverty these days .
__ja__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__ja__ How many other people ?
__ja__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__ja__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__ja__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__ja__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__ja__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__ja__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__ja__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__ja__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__ja__ Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
__ja__ They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
__ja__ He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__ja__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__ja__ They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
__ja__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__ja__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__ja__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__ja__ Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__ja__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__ja__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__ja__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__ja__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__ja__ The queen does it all .
__ja__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__ja__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__ja__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__ja__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__ja__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__ja__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__ja__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__ja__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__ja__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__ja__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__ja__ The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__ja__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
__ja__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__ja__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__ja__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__ja__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__ja__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__ja__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__ja__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__ja__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__ja__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__ja__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__ja__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
__ja__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__ja__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__ja__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__ja__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__ja__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__ja__ They &apos;re always made from local chert .
__ja__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
__ja__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__ja__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__ja__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__ja__ Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__ja__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__ja__ You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__ja__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__ja__ And that will have led to specialization .
__ja__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__ja__ Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
__ja__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__ja__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__ja__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__ja__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__ja__ An example is Tasmania .
__ja__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
__ja__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__ja__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
__ja__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__ja__ It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
__ja__ The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__ja__ The Tasmanians were isolated .
__ja__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__ja__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__ja__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__ja__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__ja__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__ja__ I mean this quite seriously .
__ja__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__ja__ He just knows how to run a company .
__ja__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__ja__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__ja__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__ja__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__ja__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__ja__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__ja__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__ja__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__ja__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
__ja__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__ja__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__ja__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__ja__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__ja__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__ja__ It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__ja__ However , bad things happen .
__ja__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__ja__ There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
__ja__ Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__ja__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__ja__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ Good afternoon .
__ja__ My name is Uldus .
__ja__ I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
__ja__ I focus on balancing meaningful message , aesthetic , beauty , composition , some irony , and artifacts .
__ja__ Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , which is named Desperate Romantics .
__ja__ They &apos;re my artifacts , or paintings from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid-19th century .
__ja__ I took the painting and gifted new , contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia , capturing people who are non-models but have an interesting story .
__ja__ This boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at secondary school , he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality , trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality .
__ja__ But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Russia .
__ja__ Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
__ja__ And this is Nikita , a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg .
__ja__ He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting Hulk from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
__ja__ Sometimes , I would compare facial features and playing with words : irony , Iron Man , ironing man .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation .
__ja__ Interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
__ja__ We &apos;re taught from childhood , successful marriage means successful life , so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband .
__ja__ And what about me ?
__ja__ I &apos;m 27 years old .
__ja__ For Russian society , I &apos;m an old maid and hopeless to ever get married .
__ja__ That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask , in the wedding dress , all desperate in my garden .
__ja__ But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stereotypes .
__ja__ Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
__ja__ Be funny and create some magic .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ My name is Amit .
__ja__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__ja__ And it took 18 months .
__ja__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__ja__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__ja__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__ja__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__ja__ And I grew up in India .
__ja__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__ja__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__ja__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__ja__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__ja__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__ja__ You look around at all these museums here .
__ja__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__ja__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__ja__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__ja__ You move around , you have fun .
__ja__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__ja__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__ja__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__ja__ Keep going . Have fun .
__ja__ Explore .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__ja__ I see this plus sign .
__ja__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__ja__ Now this is one of the images .
__ja__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__ja__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__ja__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__ja__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__ja__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__ja__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__ja__ You can zoom around very simply .
__ja__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__ja__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__ja__ But then you really want to go deep .
__ja__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__ja__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__ja__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__ja__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__ja__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__ja__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__ja__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__ja__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__ja__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__ja__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__ja__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__ja__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__ja__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__ja__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__ja__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__ja__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__ja__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__ja__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__ja__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__ja__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__ja__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__ja__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__ja__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__ja__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__ja__ It really comes from these artists .
__ja__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__ja__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__ja__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__ja__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__ja__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__ja__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__ja__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
__ja__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
__ja__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__ja__ I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
__ja__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__ja__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__ja__ Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual .
__ja__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
__ja__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
__ja__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
__ja__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__ja__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
__ja__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
__ja__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
__ja__ Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
__ja__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__ja__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
__ja__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__ja__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__ja__ It will dry up inside .
__ja__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__ja__ We all do .
__ja__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__ja__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__ja__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
__ja__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__ja__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__ja__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__ja__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__ja__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__ja__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__ja__ In my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__ja__ Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__ja__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__ja__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__ja__ My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__ja__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
__ja__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__ja__ I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__ja__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__ja__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__ja__ And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
__ja__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__ja__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__ja__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__ja__ My mother became a diplomat .
__ja__ So from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__ja__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreigner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__ja__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__ja__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__ja__ The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
__ja__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
__ja__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__ja__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__ja__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__ja__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
__ja__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__ja__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__ja__ In my mid-twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__ja__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__ja__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__ja__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__ja__ There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
__ja__ He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
__ja__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
__ja__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__ja__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__ja__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__ja__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__ja__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__ja__ I started writing fiction in English .
__ja__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__ja__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__ja__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__ja__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__ja__ When you &apos;re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__ja__ As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__ja__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__ja__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__ja__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__ja__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__ja__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__ja__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__ja__ I guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
__ja__ Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__ja__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__ja__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__ja__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__ja__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__ja__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__ja__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__ja__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__ja__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__ja__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
__ja__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more heavily .
__ja__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__ja__ You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
__ja__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .
__ja__ Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__ja__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__ja__ The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__ja__ When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__ja__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
__ja__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__ja__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__ja__ It was only because of our passports .
__ja__ Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__ja__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__ja__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__ja__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__ja__ It comes from everywhere .
__ja__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
__ja__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__ja__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__ja__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict .
__ja__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__ja__ It was just a story .
__ja__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
__ja__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__ja__ Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__ja__ Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__ja__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
__ja__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__ja__ The other , in nuances .
__ja__ One draws boundaries .
__ja__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__ja__ Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
__ja__ Fiction is flowing water .
__ja__ In the Ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__ja__ With each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
__ja__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
__ja__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__ja__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__ja__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
__ja__ Literature has to take us beyond .
__ja__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__ja__ Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was — that I once was .
__ja__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
__ja__ When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__ja__ The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
__ja__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__ja__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__ja__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__ja__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__ja__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__ja__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__ja__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace , which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
__ja__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
__ja__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__ja__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__ja__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__ja__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
__ja__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__ja__ When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
__ja__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__ja__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__ja__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__ja__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__ja__ Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__ja__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__ja__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__ja__ Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__ja__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__ja__ We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
__ja__ In the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__ja__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__ja__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__ja__ I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
__ja__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__ja__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
__ja__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__ja__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
__ja__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__ja__ Five million people use it every month .
__ja__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__ja__ His work is brilliant .
__ja__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__ja__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__ja__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
__ja__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__ja__ This is really exciting .
__ja__ According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__ja__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__ja__ We made this game in 2007 .
__ja__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__ja__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
__ja__ The &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
__ja__ It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Rockies .
__ja__ And the job in question was sheep rancher .
__ja__ My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
__ja__ I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
__ja__ And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
__ja__ The job in question : herding sheep . Great .
__ja__ We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
__ja__ So , normally , I never do any research at all .
__ja__ But , this is a touchy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
__ja__ So I called the Humane Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
__ja__ This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
__ja__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
__ja__ And then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
__ja__ Blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
__ja__ &quot; Great — got it . &quot;
__ja__ OK , I call the SPCA to confirm this — they confirm it .
__ja__ I also call PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confirm it .
__ja__ OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
__ja__ So the next day I go out .
__ja__ And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
__ja__ Melanie is the wife of Albert .
__ja__ Albert is the shepherd in question .
__ja__ Melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
__ja__ Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
__ja__ Alright . Great .
__ja__ Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
__ja__ I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
__ja__ Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
__ja__ Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
__ja__ And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
__ja__ And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
__ja__ In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
__ja__ A second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
__ja__ And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
__ja__ Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
__ja__ He snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what I hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
__ja__ Can we roll the video ?
__ja__ No I &apos;m kidding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
__ja__ So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
__ja__ I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
__ja__ There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scripting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
__ja__ We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse — we shoot what we get !
__ja__ I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
__ja__ We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Humane Society ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Humane Society .
__ja__ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb squeal and bleed — we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
__ja__ We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
__ja__ Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
__ja__ Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
__ja__ I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
__ja__ Gets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s quivering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
__ja__ And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
__ja__ When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
__ja__ Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
__ja__ He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
__ja__ And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
__ja__ And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German porno , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
__ja__ Albert hands me the knife .
__ja__ I go in , tail comes off .
__ja__ I go in , I grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
__ja__ Albert instructs , &quot; &quot; Push it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
__ja__ &quot; Push it further . &quot;
__ja__ I do .
__ja__ The testicles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; Bite &apos; em .
__ja__ Just bite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
__ja__ How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rockies , and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
__ja__ You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jacked-up metaphor ?
__ja__ I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
__ja__ I went in and I took them .
__ja__ I took them like this , and I yanked my face back .
__ja__ And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
__ja__ OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Poetics , &quot; &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
__ja__ And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__ja__ Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__ja__ Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
__ja__ Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
__ja__ It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; is .
__ja__ And I &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
__ja__ Great .
__ja__ The other word , peripeteia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know — Euripides and Sophocles — the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
__ja__ That &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
__ja__ And this metaphor in my head — I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
__ja__ When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
__ja__ I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
__ja__ Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peripetia .
__ja__ You know ?
__ja__ It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
__ja__ Neo in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
__ja__ These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
__ja__ And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK .
__ja__ Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
__ja__ Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
__ja__ And I talk to him .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
__ja__ Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
__ja__ You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
__ja__ You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
__ja__ I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
__ja__ Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
__ja__ And , after that shoot , Dirty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
__ja__ And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
__ja__ I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
__ja__ People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
__ja__ As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
__ja__ And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
__ja__ I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
__ja__ Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God — I did it with them .
__ja__ They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
__ja__ And I see it over and over and over again .
__ja__ So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
__ja__ Follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
__ja__ Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
__ja__ Probably the worst advice I ever got .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
__ja__ I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
__ja__ I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
__ja__ I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
__ja__ Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
__ja__ He &apos;s making a great living .
__ja__ You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
__ja__ The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
__ja__ He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
__ja__ He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
__ja__ And I hear that story over and over .
__ja__ Matt Froind , a dairy farmer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
__ja__ Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
__ja__ Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
__ja__ So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
__ja__ I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call &quot; &quot; successories &quot; &quot; that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now .
__ja__ That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
__ja__ Safety — safety first ?
__ja__ Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
__ja__ I mean — this is heresy , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
__ja__ Right ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
__ja__ What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
__ja__ They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
__ja__ And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; &quot; Deadliest Catch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
__ja__ We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
__ja__ Most hazardous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
__ja__ So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
__ja__ Unspeakably dangerous .
__ja__ I scamper down , I go into the wheelhouse and I say , with some level of incredulity , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
__ja__ And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
__ja__ It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
__ja__ But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
__ja__ My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
__ja__ My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
__ja__ And for the rest of that day , safety first .
__ja__ I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
__ja__ Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
__ja__ I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
__ja__ But , what it all comes down to is this .
__ja__ I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
__ja__ It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
__ja__ It &apos;s a civil war .
__ja__ It &apos;s a cold war , really .
__ja__ We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
__ja__ And we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
__ja__ The way we portray working people on TV — it &apos;s laughable .
__ja__ If there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Admit it .
__ja__ You see him all the time .
__ja__ That &apos;s what plumbers look like , right ?
__ja__ We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
__ja__ That &apos;s what TV does .
__ja__ We try hard on &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
__ja__ But , we &apos;ve waged this war on Madison Avenue .
__ja__ I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
__ja__ Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
__ja__ Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
__ja__ I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
__ja__ And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
__ja__ How many people have their Blackberries ?
__ja__ We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
__ja__ I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
__ja__ Good grief , not to this crowd .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
__ja__ And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
__ja__ Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
__ja__ All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
__ja__ So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
__ja__ Our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
__ja__ They look like the stuff we walk around with .
__ja__ And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
__ja__ And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
__ja__ And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
__ja__ I got a lot wrong .
__ja__ So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
__ja__ Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
__ja__ I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
__ja__ Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
__ja__ The infrastructure is a huge deal .
__ja__ This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
__ja__ The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
__ja__ Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
__ja__ The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
__ja__ Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
__ja__ So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
__ja__ And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
__ja__ They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
__ja__ It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__ja__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
__ja__ of sleep-deprived women .
__ja__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__ja__ Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
__ja__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__ja__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__ja__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__ja__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__ja__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
__ja__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__ja__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__ja__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__ja__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__ja__ So a high I.Q.
__ja__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__ja__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__ja__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__ja__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__ja__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__ja__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
__ja__ And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
__ja__ Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
__ja__ It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
__ja__ And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
__ja__ OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
__ja__ I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
__ja__ How does this happen ?
__ja__ Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
__ja__ One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
__ja__ What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
__ja__ What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
__ja__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__ja__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__ja__ So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
__ja__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__ja__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__ja__ If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
__ja__ And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
__ja__ And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
__ja__ You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
__ja__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__ja__ I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
__ja__ OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
__ja__ But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
__ja__ This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
__ja__ She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
__ja__ Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
__ja__ Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
__ja__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__ja__ This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud .
__ja__ I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Freudian view .
__ja__ And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
__ja__ Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
__ja__ And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
__ja__ And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
__ja__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__ja__ This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
__ja__ It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Freudian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( Laughter )
__ja__ He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__ja__ Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__ja__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__ja__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__ja__ Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
__ja__ There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
__ja__ There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
__ja__ You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
__ja__ I talked about that earlier .
__ja__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__ja__ But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
__ja__ Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
__ja__ Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?
__ja__ Which you can completely ignore .
__ja__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
__ja__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__ja__ You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
__ja__ And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
__ja__ So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?
__ja__ And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
__ja__ So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
__ja__ And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
__ja__ But maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
__ja__ So because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?
__ja__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__ja__ It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
__ja__ Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
__ja__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
__ja__ And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
__ja__ You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
__ja__ You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
__ja__ Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
__ja__ There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
__ja__ So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
__ja__ It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
__ja__ By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
__ja__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__ja__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__ja__ The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
__ja__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__ja__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
__ja__ OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
__ja__ Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
__ja__ And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
__ja__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__ja__ When an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
__ja__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__ja__ Believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
__ja__ I &apos;ve had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
__ja__ And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;
__ja__ ( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that .
__ja__ OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
__ja__ One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
__ja__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__ja__ These are very compelling , vivid sensations .
__ja__ The patient &apos;s not delusional .
__ja__ He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
__ja__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__ja__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__ja__ It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
__ja__ If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
__ja__ It sounds like an oxymoron .
__ja__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__ja__ The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
__ja__ So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
__ja__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__ja__ Patients become depressed .
__ja__ Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
__ja__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__ja__ Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
__ja__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__ja__ Why does this happen ?
__ja__ When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
__ja__ And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
__ja__ The brain learns , because of this Hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
__ja__ And then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?
__ja__ Now , how do you help these patients ?
__ja__ How do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
__ja__ Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
__ja__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
__ja__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__ja__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__ja__ So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
__ja__ You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
__ja__ He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
__ja__ He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
__ja__ He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__ja__ It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
__ja__ So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
__ja__ And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
__ja__ He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
__ja__ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
__ja__ That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started giggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
__ja__ He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
__ja__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__ja__ And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__ja__ And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes .
__ja__ &quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
__ja__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;
__ja__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__ja__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__ja__ So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
__ja__ So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
__ja__ But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
__ja__ So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
__ja__ Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
__ja__ I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
__ja__ It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
__ja__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
__ja__ But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
__ja__ Now , why does this happen ?
__ja__ It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
__ja__ It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
__ja__ On the other hand , there &apos;s no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
__ja__ And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
__ja__ It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
__ja__ And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
__ja__ So , that &apos;s the bonus .
__ja__ Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
__ja__ Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
__ja__ But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
__ja__ This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
__ja__ OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
__ja__ This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
__ja__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__ja__ He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
__ja__ Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ?
__ja__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__ja__ Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
__ja__ C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
__ja__ Why does this happen ?
__ja__ This is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
__ja__ In us , all the senses are distinct .
__ja__ These people muddle up their senses .
__ja__ Why does this happen ?
__ja__ One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
__ja__ Synesthesia runs in families , so Galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
__ja__ Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
__ja__ Why would that be ?
__ja__ I &apos;m going to answer that question .
__ja__ It &apos;s never been answered before .
__ja__ OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
__ja__ Well , there are many theories .
__ja__ One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
__ja__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__ja__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
__ja__ Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?
__ja__ So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
__ja__ So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
__ja__ So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia .
__ja__ Now remember — why does this happen ?
__ja__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__ja__ Remember I said it runs in families ?
__ja__ That gives you the clue .
__ja__ And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
__ja__ In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
__ja__ So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
__ja__ So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
__ja__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
__ja__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
__ja__ So far , so good .
__ja__ Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
__ja__ Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?
__ja__ I mean , schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
__ja__ Normal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun .
__ja__ Instantly , you &apos;ve found the links .
__ja__ Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
__ja__ And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
__ja__ OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
__ja__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__ja__ ( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetes , but you &apos;re in denial about it .
__ja__ Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
__ja__ Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
__ja__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__ja__ One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
__ja__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__ja__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__ja__ Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands .
__ja__ Ninety-nine percent of you .
__ja__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__ja__ It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
__ja__ Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
__ja__ It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
__ja__ If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glitters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
__ja__ You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
__ja__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__ja__ Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
__ja__ And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
__ja__ All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Sorry about that .
__ja__ ( Laughter )
__ja__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__ja__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
__ja__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
__ja__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__ja__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__ja__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__ja__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__ja__ Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
__ja__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__ja__ I had to do something .
__ja__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__ja__ So I tried bronze casting .
__ja__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__ja__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__ja__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
__ja__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__ja__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
__ja__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__ja__ I was mesmerized .
__ja__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
__ja__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__ja__ Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
__ja__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
__ja__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__ja__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__ja__ Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__ja__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
__ja__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__ja__ So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
__ja__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__ja__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__ja__ I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
__ja__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__ja__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__ja__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
__ja__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
__ja__ So we had to create one .
__ja__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
__ja__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__ja__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
__ja__ Now it had a sense of place .
__ja__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__ja__ As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__ja__ My life was not going to be the same .
__ja__ I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__ja__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__ja__ Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
__ja__ So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__ja__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__ja__ Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__ja__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__ja__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
__ja__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__ja__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
__ja__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__ja__ Its shape was too complex now .
__ja__ So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__ja__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__ja__ There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__ja__ So we had to create it .
__ja__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__ja__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__ja__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__ja__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__ja__ Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
__ja__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__ja__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__ja__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__ja__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__ja__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__ja__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__ja__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__ja__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ So when I was a kid ...
__ja__ this was my team .
__ja__ ( Laughter ) I stunk at sports .
__ja__ I didn &apos;t like to play them , I didn &apos;t like to watch them .
__ja__ So this is what I did . I went fishing .
__ja__ And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut , and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis .
__ja__ But after I grew up and went to college , and I came home in the early 90 &apos;s , this is what I found .
__ja__ My team had shrunk .
__ja__ It was like literally having your roster devastated .
__ja__ And as I sort of looked into that , from a very personal point of view as a fisherman , I started to kind of figure out , well , what was the rest of the world thinking about it ?
__ja__ First place I started to look was fish markets .
__ja__ And when I went to fish markets , in spite of where I was — whether I was in North Carolina , or Paris , or London , or wherever — I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures , again and again — on the menus , on ice — shrimp , tuna , salmon and cod .
__ja__ And I thought this was pretty strange , and as I looked at it , I was wondering , did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market ?
__ja__ Well , when I looked into it , I realized that people didn &apos;t look at it as their team .
__ja__ Ordinary people , the way they looked at seafood was like this .
__ja__ It &apos;s not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements .
__ja__ We did it before , 10,000 years ago , when we came out of our caves .
__ja__ If you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see raccoons , you &apos;ll see , you know , wolves , you &apos;ll see all kinds of different creatures .
__ja__ But if you telescope to the age of — you know , 2,000 years ago , you &apos;ll see these four mammals : pigs , cows , sheep and goats .
__ja__ It &apos;s true of birds , too .
__ja__ You look at the menus in New York City restaurants 150 years ago , 200 years ago , you &apos;ll see snipe , woodcock , grouse , dozens of ducks , dozens of geese .
__ja__ But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry , and you &apos;ll see four : turkeys , ducks , chicken and geese .
__ja__ So it makes sense that we &apos;ve headed in this direction .
__ja__ But how have we headed in this direction ?
__ja__ Well ...
__ja__ first it &apos;s a very , very new problem .
__ja__ This is the way we &apos;ve been fishing the oceans over the last 50 years .
__ja__ World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish .
__ja__ All of the technology that we perfected during World War II — sonar , lightweight polymers — all these things were redirected towards fish .
__ja__ And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity , quadrupling in the course of time , from the end of World War II to the present time .
__ja__ And right now that means we &apos;re taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year .
__ja__ That &apos;s the equivalent of the human weight of China taken out of the sea every year .
__ja__ And it &apos;s no coincidence that I use China as the example because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world .
__ja__ Well , that &apos;s only half the story .
__ja__ The other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture , which is now , only in the last year or two , starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce .
__ja__ So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together , you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean each and every year .
__ja__ And again , it &apos;s not a coincidence that I use China as the example , because China , in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish , is also the biggest farmer of fish .
__ja__ So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
__ja__ The first one — by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West , is shrimp .
__ja__ Shrimp in the wild — as a wild product — is a terrible product .
__ja__ 5 , 10 , 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market .
__ja__ They &apos;re also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market .
__ja__ In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University , it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find .
__ja__ So you can farm them , and people do farm them , and they farm them a lot in this very area .
__ja__ Problem is ...
__ja__ the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats — in mangrove forests .
__ja__ Now look at those lovely roots coming down .
__ja__ Those are the things that hold soil together , protect coasts , create habitats for all sorts of young fish , young shrimp , all sorts of things that are important to this environment .
__ja__ Well , this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests .
__ja__ We &apos;ve lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves over the last 30 or 40 years .
__ja__ That rate of destruction has slowed , but we &apos;re still in a major mangrove deficit .
__ja__ The other thing that &apos;s going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called &quot; &quot; Grinding Nemo . &quot; &quot; This phenomenon is very , very relevant to anything that you &apos;ve ever seen on a tropical reef .
__ja__ Because what &apos;s going on right now , we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp , catching a huge amount of bycatch , that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food .
__ja__ And sometimes , many of these vessels — manned by slaves — are catching these so-called &quot; &quot; trash fish , &quot; &quot; fish that we would love to see on a reef , grinding them up and turning them into shrimp feed — an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp .
__ja__ The next most consumed seafood in America , and also throughout the West , is tuna .
__ja__ So tuna is this ultimate global fish .
__ja__ These huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed .
__ja__ Our own management area , called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization , is called ICCAT , the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas .
__ja__ The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it , &quot; The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas . &quot;
__ja__ Of course we &apos;ve seen incredible improvement in ICCAT in the last few years , there is total room for improvement , but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish , and to manage it , we have to manage the globe .
__ja__ Well , we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture .
__ja__ Many people don &apos;t know this but tuna are warm-blooded .
__ja__ They can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature , they can swim at over 40 miles an hour .
__ja__ So that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish , right ?
__ja__ A farmed fish is — or a fish is cold-blooded , it doesn &apos;t move too much .
__ja__ That &apos;s a great thing for growing protein .
__ja__ But if you &apos;ve got this crazy , wild creature that swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood — not a great candidate for aquaculture .
__ja__ The next creature — most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West — is salmon .
__ja__ Now salmon got its plundering , too , but it didn &apos;t really necessarily happen through fishing .
__ja__ This is my home state of Connecticut .
__ja__ Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon .
__ja__ But if you look at this map of Connecticut , every dot on that map is a dam .
__ja__ There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut .
__ja__ I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight — ( Laughter ) If somebody could just unblock Connecticut &apos;s chi , I feel that we could have an infinitely better world .
__ja__ But I made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers , and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me , he says , &quot; &quot; You know , you oughtn &apos;t be so hard on your Connecticut , cause we here in North Carolina , we got 35,000 dams . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s a national epidemic , it &apos;s an international epidemic .
__ja__ And there are dams everywhere , and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds .
__ja__ So as a result , we &apos;ve turned to aquaculture , and salmon is one the most successful , at least from a numbers point of view .
__ja__ When they first started farming salmon , it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon .
__ja__ The industry has , to its credit , greatly improved .
__ja__ They &apos;ve gotten it below two to one , although it &apos;s a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced , they &apos;re measuring pellets — pounds of pellets per pound of salmon .
__ja__ Those pellets are in turn reduced fish .
__ja__ So the actual — what &apos;s called the FIFO , the fish in and the fish out — kind of hard to say .
__ja__ But in any case , credit to the industry , it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon .
__ja__ Problem is we &apos;ve also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we &apos;re producing .
__ja__ Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet .
__ja__ It &apos;s growing at something like seven percent per year .
__ja__ And so even though we &apos;re doing less per fish to bring it to the market , we &apos;re still killing a lot of these little fish .
__ja__ And it &apos;s not just fish that we &apos;re feeding fish to , we &apos;re also feeding fish to chickens and pigs .
__ja__ So we &apos;ve got chickens and they &apos;re eating fish , but weirdly , we also have fish that are eating chickens .
__ja__ Because the byproducts of chickens — feathers , blood , bone — get ground up and fed to fish .
__ja__ So I often wonder , is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish ?
__ja__ It &apos;s sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing . Anyway — ( Laughter ) All together , though , it results in a terrible mess .
__ja__ What you &apos;re talking about is something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up .
__ja__ That &apos;s the equivalent of a third of a China , or of an entire United States of humans that &apos;s taken out of the sea each and every year .
__ja__ The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing .
__ja__ It &apos;s what the industry calls &quot; &quot; whitefish . &quot; &quot; There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story , I think , is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation , the Filet-O-Fish sandwich .
__ja__ So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich actually started as halibut .
__ja__ And it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his McDonald &apos;s on Friday , nobody came .
__ja__ Because it was a Catholic community , they needed fish .
__ja__ So he went to Ray Kroc and he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to bring you a fish sandwich , going to be made out of halibut . &quot;
__ja__ Ray Kroc said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to work .
__ja__ I want to do a Hula Burger , and there &apos;s going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun .
__ja__ But let &apos;s do this , let &apos;s have a bet .
__ja__ Whosever sandwich sells more , that will be the winning sandwich . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn &apos;t win .
__ja__ So he made his halibut sandwich .
__ja__ Unfortunately though , the sandwich came in at 30 cents .
__ja__ Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents , so he turned to Atlantic cod .
__ja__ We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England .
__ja__ So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock , it &apos;s the largest fin fish fishery in the United States , 2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year .
__ja__ If we go through the pollock , the next choice is probably going to be tilapia .
__ja__ Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago .
__ja__ It &apos;s actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein , and it &apos;s been a godsend to the third world .
__ja__ It &apos;s actually a tremendously sustainable solution , it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months .
__ja__ The problem is that when you look about the West , it doesn &apos;t do what the West wants it to do .
__ja__ It really doesn &apos;t have what &apos;s called an oily fish profile .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t have the EPA and DHA omega-3s that we all think are going to make us live forever .
__ja__ So what do we do ?
__ja__ I mean , first of all , what about this poor fish , the clupeids ?
__ja__ The fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons .
__ja__ Well , one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them ?
__ja__ Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon ?
__ja__ There are arguments for it .
__ja__ They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market , a fraction of the fuel cost of say , shrimp , and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale .
__ja__ They also are omega-3 rich , a great source for EPA and DHA .
__ja__ So that is a potential .
__ja__ And if we were to go down that route what I would say is , instead of paying a few bucks a pound — or a few bucks a ton , really — and making it into aquafeed , could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish ?
__ja__ Other possibility though , which is much more interesting , is looking at bivalves , particularly mussels .
__ja__ Now , mussels are very high in EPA and DHA , they &apos;re similar to canned tuna .
__ja__ They &apos;re also extremely fuel efficient .
__ja__ To bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market .
__ja__ They require no forage fish , they actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae .
__ja__ In fact , that &apos;s where omega-3s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish .
__ja__ Microalgae make the omega-3s , they &apos;re only bioconcentrated in fish .
__ja__ Mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration .
__ja__ A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day .
__ja__ And this is incredibly important when we look at the world .
__ja__ Right now , nitrification , overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms .
__ja__ Over 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years , tremendous sources of marine life death .
__ja__ We also could look at not a fish at all .
__ja__ We could look at a vegetable .
__ja__ We could look at seaweed , the kelps , all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega-3s , can be high in proteins , tremendously good things .
__ja__ They filter the water just like mussels do .
__ja__ And weirdly enough , it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows .
__ja__ Now , I &apos;m not a big fan of cattle .
__ja__ But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited , you &apos;re growing seaweed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it — major consideration .
__ja__ And the last fish is a question mark .
__ja__ We have the ability to create aquacultured fish that creates a net gain of marine protein for us .
__ja__ This creature would have to be vegetarian , it would have to be fast growing , it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile , that EPA , DHA , omega-3 fatty acid profile that we &apos;re looking for .
__ja__ This exists kind of on paper .
__ja__ I have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years .
__ja__ Every time I do a new story , somebody tells me , &quot; &quot; We can do all that . We can do it . We &apos;ve figured it all out .
__ja__ We can produce a fish that &apos;s a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s . &quot; &quot; Great .
__ja__ It doesn &apos;t seem to be getting scaled up .
__ja__ It is time to scale this up .
__ja__ If we do , 30 million metric tons of seafood , a third of the world catch , stays in the water .
__ja__ So I guess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
__ja__ We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds .
__ja__ But if we went with this , or some configuration of it , we might have a little more of this .
__ja__ Thank you .
__ja__ ( Applause )
__ja__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__ja__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__ja__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__ja__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__ja__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__ja__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__ja__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__ja__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__ja__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__ja__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__ja__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__ja__ And I felt lighter in my body .
