When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
( Applause ) My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
And slightly more complex things appear .
That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
( Laughter ) It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
No one is exactly shocked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines — girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
I was not an activist .
I wave no flags in my own life .
But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
Were we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
It might give them pause .
Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
( Laughter ) So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
And then we made this .
( Music ) Video : I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
( Music ) &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
There is no equality in the United States .
&#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Marriage &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Freedom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
I want to take the project across the country .
I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Self evident truths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) iO Tillett Wright : Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
Visibility really is key .
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; gays &quot; &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
Can you quantify your openness ?
Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; &quot; Grey . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
Thank you .

I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
Some I even considered like my second home .
But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
They have nothing to compare it to .
When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back doors .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
My interpreter told me their stories .
&quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
Wrong . They were all enslaved .
Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
This young child is eight years old .
He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
Many of them drown .
For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
in the cold , windy night .
And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
Mercury is used in the extraction process .
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
I want to shine a light on slavery .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
Thank you very much .

The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban .
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
This is our group , our main group of weavers .
They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
They all have bank accounts .
They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .

In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
Here &apos;s my clock .
It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
You can see why I hate Chris .
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant noodles .
Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
OK , next , clubbing .
These people I still do hang out with .
All right , and smoking .
Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
Oh , one last thing before I leave .
And the best way to do that is with free candy .
You guys ready ?
All right .

When I was six years old , I received my gifts .
My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea .
So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom , and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner .
If you hear your name called , go and pick up your gift and sit down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?
What could go wrong ?
( Laughter ) Well , there were 40 of us to start with , and every time I heard someone &apos;s name called , I would give out the heartiest cheer .
And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ...
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the compliments stopped .
Well , at that moment , I was crying .
And the teacher was freaking out .
So behave next year — someone might say something nice about you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , as I &apos;m describing this you , you probably know I remember this really well . ( Laughter )
But I don &apos;t know who felt worse that day .
Was it me or the teacher ?
She must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds .
And without the humor .
You know , when you see people get roasted on TV , it was funny .
There was nothing funny about that day .
So that was one version of me , and I would die to avoid being in that situation again — to get rejected in public again .
That &apos;s one version .
Then fast-forward eight years .
Bill Gates came to my hometown — Beijing , China — to speak , and I saw his message .
I fell in love with that guy .
I thought , wow , I know what I want to do now .
And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that letter .
And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad handwriting , but I did highlight some key words .
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another version of me : one who will conquer the world .
Well , then two years later , I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States .
I jumped on it , because that was where Bill Gates lived , right ?
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey .
Then , fast-forward another 14 years .
I was 30 .
Nope , I didn &apos;t build that company .
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company .
And I felt I was stuck ; I was stagnant .
Why is that ?
Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter ?
It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
It &apos;s because every time I had a new idea , every time I wanted to try something new , even at work — I wanted to make a proposal , I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group — I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old .
One wanted to conquer the world — make a difference — another was afraid of rejection .
And every time that six-year-old won .
When I was an entrepreneur , I was presented with an investment opportunity , and then I was turned down .
And that rejection hurt me .
It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there .
But then I thought , hey , would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection ?
Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that ?
No way .
And this is where it clicked for me .
OK , I can build a better company .
I can build a better team or better product , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better leader .
I &apos;ve got to be a better person .
I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore .
I have to put him back in his place .
So this is where I went online and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
Then I came up with a bunch of &quot; &quot; rah-rah &quot; &quot; inspirational articles about &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t take it personally , just overcome it . &quot; &quot; Who doesn &apos;t know that ?
( Laughter ) But why was I still so scared ?
Then I found this website by luck .
It &apos;s called rejectiontherapy.com.
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Rejection Therapy &quot; &quot; was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur .
His name is Jason Comely .
And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection , and every day get rejected at something , and then by the end , you desensitize yourself from the pain .
And I loved that idea .
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this .
And I &apos;ll feel myself getting rejected 100 days . &quot; &quot; And I came up with my own rejection ideas , and I made a video blog out of it .
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the blog looked like .
Day One ...
( Laughter ) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
He looked like a security guard .
So I just approached him .
And I got there and said , &quot; Hey , sir , can I borrow 100 dollars from you ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;
And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; Then I turned around , and I just ran .
I looked like this kid in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense . &quot; &quot; I saw dead people .
( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
You know , he wasn &apos;t that menacing .
He was a chubby , loveable guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he invited me to explain myself .
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
I could &apos;ve explained , I could &apos;ve negotiated .
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
All I did was run .
I felt , wow , this is like a microcosm of my life .
Every time I felt the slightest rejection , I would just run as fast as I could .
And you know what ?
The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run .
I &apos;ll stay engaged .
Day Two : Request a &quot; &quot; burger refill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s when I went to a burger joint , I finished lunch , and I went to the cashier and said , &quot; Hi , can I get a burger refill ? &quot; ( Laughter )
He was all confused , like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a burger refill ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like a drink refill but with a burger . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Sorry , we don &apos;t do burger refill , man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So this is where rejection happened and I could have run , but I stayed .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I love your burgers , I love your joint , and if you guys do a burger refill , I will love you guys more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , I &apos;ll tell my manager about it , and maybe we &apos;ll do it , but sorry , we can &apos;t do this today . &quot; &quot; Then I left .
And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done burger refill .
I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , great , I &apos;m already learning things .
This is where my life was turned upside down .
I went to a Krispy Kreme .
I &apos;m sure they have some here , too .
Basically , you interlink five doughnuts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say yes , right ?
The doughnut maker took me so seriously .
( Laughter ) So she put out paper , started jotting down the colors and the rings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings .
And I was so touched .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million views on Youtube .
The world couldn &apos;t believe that either .
( Laughter ) You know , because of that I was in newspapers , in talk shows , in everything .
And I became famous .
A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is awesome . &quot; &quot; But you know , fame and notoriety did not do anything to me .
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground — into this research project .
I wanted to see what I could learn .
And then I learned a lot of things .
I discovered so many secrets .
( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; Hey , can I know why ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard .
I don &apos;t want to waste your flower .
If you want to do this , go across the street and talk to Connie .
She loves flowers . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
I went across and knocked on Connie &apos;s door .
And she was so happy to see me .
( Laughter ) And then half an hour later , there was this flower in Connie &apos;s backyard .
I &apos;m sure it looks better now .
( Laughter ) But had I left after the initial rejection , I would &apos;ve thought , well , it &apos;s because the guy didn &apos;t trust me , it &apos;s because I was crazy , because I didn &apos;t dress up well , I didn &apos;t look good .
It was none of those .
It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted .
And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral , using a sales term .
I converted a referral .
Then one day — and I also learned that I can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes .
So for example , one day I went to a Starbucks , and asked the manager , &quot; &quot; Hey , can I be a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Do you know those Walmart greeters ?
I want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a good thing , actually — Actually , I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s a bad thing .
And he was like , &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; — yeah , this is how he looked , his name is Eric — and he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; This is how he was hearing me . &quot; &quot; Not sure . &quot; &quot; Then I ask him , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s really weird , man . &quot; &quot; But as soon as he said that , his whole demeanor changed .
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s putting all the doubt on the floor .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you can do this , just don &apos;t get too weird . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter .
I said &quot; &quot; hi &quot; &quot; to every customer that walked in , and gave them holiday cheers .
By the way , I don &apos;t know what your career trajectory is , don &apos;t be a greeter .
( Laughter ) It was really boring .
But then I found I could do this because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; I mentioned the doubt that he was having .
And because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t weird .
That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a weird thing .
And again , and again , I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have before I ask the question , I gained their trust .
People were more likely to say yes to me .
And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...
by asking .
But it has always been my dream to actually teach something .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What if I just ask and teach a college class ? &quot; &quot; I lived in Austin at the time , so I went to University of Texas at Austin and knocked on professors &apos; doors and said , &quot; &quot; Can I teach your class ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t get anywhere the first couple of times .
But because I didn &apos;t run — I kept doing it — and on the third try the professor was very impressed .
He was like , &quot; &quot; No one has done this before . &quot; &quot; And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson .
He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , I can use this .
Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll fit you in my curriculum . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was teaching a class .
This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture .
You know , sometimes you get rejected by lighting , you know ?
( Laughter ) But wow — when I finished teaching that class , I walked out crying , because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking .
I used to think I have to accomplish all these things — have to be a great entrepreneur , or get a PhD to teach — but no , I just asked , and I could teach .
And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quoted Martin Luther King , Jr .
Why ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections .
People like Martin Luther King , Jr . , like Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela , or even Jesus Christ .
These people did not let rejection define them .
They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves .
And they embraced rejection .
And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about rejection , and in my case , rejection was my curse , was my boogeyman .
It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it .
Then I started embracing it .
I turned that into the biggest gift in my life .
I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities .
I use my blog , I use my talk , I use the book I just published , and I &apos;m even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection .
When you get rejected in life , when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure , consider the possibilities .
Don &apos;t run .
If you just embrace them , they might become your gifts as well .
Thank you .

My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a businessman .
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
So I guess I was the lucky one .
My mother had 16 pregnancies .
From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
Day to day , I watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I completed my education , but I wanted to go to university .
Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dormitory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
So as a result , my father sent me to America .
I came to America .
I completed my education .
And do you know that at the time I was completing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
My family was in a refugee camp .
So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
I wanted them to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Day after day , when I listened to the news , when I followed what was going on with my country , my heart was breaking up .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
I was a professor at a university .
I earned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the refugee camp .
And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan , there were 7.5 million refugees . 7.5 million refugees .
About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
So it was a very devastating situation .
My heart was beating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
At that moment , we talk about momentum .
At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
How could I help these people ?
I am one individual . What can I do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
It transformed me . It gave me status .
It gave me confidence . It gave me a career .
It helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
But do you think it was easy ?
No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
And also , by Russia invading Afghanistan , people were not trusting anyone .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
Somebody who comes from the United States .
Somebody who got educated here .
Did they trust me ? Of course not .
So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
I asked .
Finally , I found one man .
He was 80 years old .
He was a mullah .
In a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
one day I was in the office in Peshawar , Pakistan .
All of a sudden , I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , &quot; &quot; Run away , hide ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
You &apos;re scared . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on the line .
But as a leader , you have to hold it together .
You have to hold it together and show strength .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
So I invited them to the office .
They came , and there were nine of them — nine Taliban .
They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
( Laughter ) Very mean-looking people , black clothes , black turban , and they pour into my office .
And I invited them to have a seat and have tea .
They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
But also I was strong , holding myself up .
And , of course , by that time , you know how I dress — I dress from head to toe in a black hijab .
The only thing you could see , my eyes .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
Don &apos;t you know that school is banned for girls ?
What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
We have some students coming , and they are all learning Koran , Holy Book .
And you know , Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking Pashto .
By that time , my staff poured into my office .
They were scared to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
( Laughter ) Of course , I was happy to be alive .
But also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban — of course during the Taliban there is another story .
We went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls , 3,000 students underground , and continuously we trained .
With the fall of the Taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
We opened women &apos;s learning center .
We continuously opened clinics .
We worked with mothers and children .
We had reproductive health training .
We had all kinds of training that you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was delighted with the outcome of my work .
And one day , with four trainers and one bodyguard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
Rifles on their shoulders , they blocked the road .
And I told my driver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the driver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bodyguard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
And by that time , the women are yelling and screaming inside the car .
I am very shaken up , and I told myself , this is it .
This time , we all are going to be killed .
There is no doubt in my mind .
But still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
My leg was shaking , and I got outside .
And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
We know where you are going .
Every day you go up north here and there .
You train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
You build their skills . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK .
It &apos;s a trap to me , of course .
We only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
They ran away home . Nobody stayed there .
My bodyguard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
I was shaken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
Because we had training going on up north already .
Hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; And I answered her .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I tried to cover .
No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I told her the whole story .
At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
So we stopped the car .
I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
Today , they are the best trainers .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my guides .
Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . They are ahead , and we go .
And they protect us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That tells you that education transforms people .
When you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
We cannot only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time .
( Laughter ) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
So we are continuously giving training to men , and I really believe strongly .
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful , peaceful country .
We were going everywhere .
Women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
We never locked our doors .
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
They are training to be doctors , back again .
They are training to be teachers , and they are running businesses .
We have one poet , Mawlānā Rūmī .
He said that by having compassion and having love , you can conquer the world .
And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
Thank you very , very much .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up hating lions so much .
The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
So they kill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )

( Applause ) Maya Penn : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon , and I &apos;ve been making animated flip books since I was three years old .
At that age , I also learned about what an animator was .
There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life .
Animation and art has always been my first love .
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
And thus , &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; &quot; was born .
At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
That started my love for technology .
I built my first website myself in HTML , and I &apos;m learning JavaScript and Python .
I &apos;m also working on an animated series called &quot; &quot; The Pollinators . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
If plants aren &apos;t pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
( Applause ) ( Foot stomp ) ( Music ) ( Roar ) Pollinator : Deforestsaurus ! I should have known !
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my animations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
Ideas can spark a movement .
Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya &apos;s Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya &apos;s Ideas for the Planet .
( Laughter ) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
I was greatly influenced by art , and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did , even my business .
I would find different fabrics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scarf or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for designs .
I noticed when I wore my creations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
And I thought , I can start my own business .
Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
My mom taught me how to sew , and on my back porch , I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon , and I would write down the names and the price of each item .
I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
Soon , my items began selling all over the world , and I had customers in Denmark , Italy , Australia , Canada and more .
Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
Soon , my business really started to take off .
Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
These actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it .
So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
Thank you , and peace and blessings .
Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just — Ah !

You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initiation rites .
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
A language is a flash of the human spirit .
It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
They speared each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give birth to the spirits .
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?
So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes — who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
The Neolithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
We think that polemics — ( Applause ) — we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
156 nations carry our television channel .
Our magazines are read by millions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you very much .

When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
So I started planning how to help them escape .
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .

This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
We made this kindergarten to be a circle .
It &apos;s a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
This is how the rooftop looks .
And why did we design this ?
The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a handrail . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a handrail . &quot;
But we could keep that idea around the trees .
There are three trees popping through .
And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
They fall into the net .
And you get more , and more , more .
( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
It looks so nice from underneath .
Monkeys in the zoo .
( Laughter ) Feeding time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he &apos;s putting water into his boots .
( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
Because there is no boundary .
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
But here , just they leave and come back .
It &apos;s a natural process .
And secondly , we consider noise very important .
You know that children sleep better in noise .
They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
They need noise .
And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
You are not supposed to be in silence .
And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
You know , it &apos;s completely open .
And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
In summer you go swimming .
The sand is 50 degrees .
And also , you should know that you are waterproof .
You never melt in rain .
So , children are supposed to be outside .
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divide classrooms .
They are supposed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A classroom .
And a washbasin .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some trees in the classroom .
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
And each classroom has at least one skylight .
And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
So you have to consider safety .
So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
And then we put other children .
The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo , as you know .
( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
And the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
But the surprise is yet to come .
The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
They need to get some injury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
might be answered by studying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
You were lied to .
Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
And , again , we want to learn more about it .
Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
Here is a computer simulation .
And we need a way to simplify it .
Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They are not faster horses .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .

Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
At the time , I was cardiologist at UCLA , specializing in cardiac imaging techniques .
The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo .
An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
But occasionally , they do reach into the human medical community , particularly for some speciality consultation , and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help .
And this procedure , which I have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that paw and that tail .
Now most of the time , I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients .
And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
So I started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever attended a veterinary conference ?
For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
Every medication that we prescribe or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
But there &apos;s something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology .
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles .
But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
Physicians and scientists , we accept intellectually that our species , Homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
Fear-induced heart failure .
Around the year 2000 , human cardiologists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
Self-injury .
Some human patients harm themselves .
Some pluck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
There are birds that pluck out feathers .
There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-injury in their self-injuring animals .
Shouldn &apos;t this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self-injury ?
Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis .
In the United States and now internationally , at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
Because it turns out , some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren &apos;t human .
Can geographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
And I moved to Redlands California .
Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
So , how many people are in the white ?
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
Did you know that data existed ?
For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
This could be my little assessment .
And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
But it will also be useful for us .
I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .

So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
That is me playing my imaginary piano .
An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so unfair .
So I was determined to find another calling .
Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
I turned to books .
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
Books banned in China , of course .
&quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
It offers many insights .
For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So I started reading books in pairs .
So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !
&quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high speeds .
That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vuvuzela , weird jokes about octopi .
But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stressing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
It &apos;s been a major trending topic .
Being a monolingual American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
Every year , more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades .
Ethan Zuckerman : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao .
And it &apos;s terribly endangered .
The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Brazilian friends tell me — is pitching in to help out .
It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
Now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
&quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
In Portugese , it means &quot; &quot; Shut your mouth , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refers to this guy , Galvao Bueno , who &apos;s the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo .
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again .
So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea , put up this banner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
So as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter .
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
As far as national representation , 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter .
That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space .
It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space .
Twitter recently did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
That &apos;s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population .
And again , that was very shocking to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .
And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations .
This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that cookout is a mostly black conversation .
And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
You click on that cookout tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it .
But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend Eli Pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
And we tend not to see that wider picture .
Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Being Digital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of Evian water on the table .
And Negroponte says this is crazy .
This is the old economy .
It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
We &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is speedy , it &apos;s weightless .
It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
Now , Negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in Fiji , shipped at great expense to the United States .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music .
It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fiji .
There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
There &apos;s crackdowns on the press .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like airline routes .
It includes things like the Internet cables .
We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bangalore later today .
Two hops , you &apos;re in Suva , the capitol of Fiji .
It &apos;s all right there .
When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
You start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
It &apos;s extremely lumpy .
There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
There &apos;s basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York .
but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
The world is , in fact , getting more global .
It &apos;s getting more connected .
More of problems are global in scale .
More of our economics is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk .
Alisa &apos;s the president of Public Radio International .
And she made a cartogram , which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month .
And you see that when you distort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S.
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dreadful , and I agree that it &apos;s dreadful — I &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a map made by Mark Graham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded .
And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
Even within Wikipedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
You probably won &apos;t .
If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites .
It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism .
We look at the internet .
We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red Sox scores .
So this is a real problem — not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
This is a problem we have to solve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
This is a group called Global Voices .
This is a team of bloggers from around the world .
Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
We started in 2004 .
You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
Nor do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encouragement .
One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much simpler .
It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
Most independent media was shut down .
And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak Malagasy .
I &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
If you &apos;re using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine translation of the page .
And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dreadful with Chinese .
And the results can be pretty funny .
What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this .
And if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Yeeyan .
And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
They put it online for free .
It &apos;s the project of a guy named Zhang Lei , who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Yeeyan ?
Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guarantee that we &apos;re going to find it .
When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
We use a lot of search .
And search is terrific if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
But if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
You need a guide .
So this is Amira Al Hussaini . She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices .
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of Ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
She has to know something about what stories are available .
Basically , she &apos;s a deejay .
She &apos;s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience .
I know Amira .
I can ask her what to read .
But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
So once you start widening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start translating , once you start curating , you end up in some really weird places .
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is AfriGadget .
And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel .
And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conceivably care about this ? &quot;
And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
This is Erik Hersman . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
He goes by the moniker White African .
He &apos;s both a very well known American geek , but he &apos;s also Kenyan ; he was born in Sudan , grew up in Kenya .
He is a bridge figure .
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
And that &apos;s where we start talking about xenophiles .
So if I found myself in the NFL , I suspect I would spend my off-season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hip-hop album .
Dhani Jones , who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
Dhani has a television show .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , Dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
He finds a local sporting team .
He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing .
It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia .
My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TEDGlobal — is that most of you are xenophiles , whether or not you use that term .
My challenge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have .
We have to fix our media .
We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
We have to fix our immigration policy .
We need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .

Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity .
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emptying out .
The question is , why ?
And here &apos;s the unromantic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
One-sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
And here &apos;s the second punch line .
That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
Stars have shined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
Thank you .
The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
Guess who was the performing guest ?
Susan Boyle .
And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
( Laughter ) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
That was hilarious .
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
Well , being different is not that difficult .
We are all different from different perspectives .
But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
You may have the chance to make a difference .
My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton — it &apos;s still there .
So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
But actually , they were impressed by my words .
And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
So I was on a national television prime-time show .
And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei — 20 years old , beautiful .
She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
It is still boiling .
It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
On Tencent , 200 million .
The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
So how are they different ?
First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
Most of them have fairly good education .
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
College graduates are not in short supply .
In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
But they died because of all different personal reasons .
But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
These diagrams show a more general social background .
The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
And guess what , we have faked beef .
They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
They &apos;re not rich at all .
They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
And also , people are doing good through social media .
And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
And here also people are helping to find missing children .
A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
Thank you very much .

Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exams , your lab values , a list of medicines .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
And , it worked .
For example , here we see Francesca Fini in her performance .
I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re honest lies .
I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from Pablo Picasso , &quot; &quot; We all know that Art is not truth .
And I said , I &apos;ve got PowerPoint . Let &apos;s do a Venn diagram .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Truth . Lies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , boom .
All right . Venn diagram . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very helpful either .
I used to be a summer camp counselor .
I was in charge of the four-year-olds , which is good , because four-year-olds can &apos;t play sports , and neither can I.
I would tell them about how , on the weekends , I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England .
You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question .
In my fantasy , they were svelte Russian women , but , you know , four-year-olds — you take what you can get in Berkeley , California .
I think the pinnacle of this for me — I &apos;ll never forget this — there was this little girl named Riley . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit .
And so Riley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of camp , I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy , and then at lunchtime , I was like , &quot; Riley , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;
Put them in the trash can . It ruins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Riley carried that melon around with her all day , and she was so proud .
And Riley knew she didn &apos;t grow a melon in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fiction .
I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
and yet we also know that they are .
When I was a kid , I was obsessed with secret door novels , things like &quot; &quot; Narnia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land .
There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
After college , my first job was working behind one of these secret doors .
This is a place called 826 Valencia .
They have eyepatches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s springtime , pirates want to go wild .
You don &apos;t know . Black is boring . Pastel .
Or eyes , also in lots of colors , just glass eyes , depending on how you want to deal with that situation .
It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
They &apos;re from all eras , including just the 1980s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very recent past .
There &apos;s our Employees of the Month , including Genghis Khan , Charles Dickens .
Some great people have come up through our ranks .
This is our kind of pharmacy section .
Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
Barbarian repellent . It &apos;s full of salad and potpourri — things that barbarians hate .
Dead languages .
( Laughter ) Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
And Viking Odorant , which comes in lots of great scents : toenails , sweat and rotten vegetables , pyre ash .
Because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield , not under your arms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emotion chips , so robots can feel love or fear .
And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
If I &apos;m going to break down the fourth wall , I want fiction to escape and come into the real world .
I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
And so I try to do this in my books .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
So it &apos;s delivered overnight by FedUp .
( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
And kids do write in .
So here &apos;s a letter . It says , &quot; &quot; Dear people , I bet you 10 bucks you won &apos;t send me a blue whale .
He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
And when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the outgoing message , it &apos;s just whale sounds and then a beep , which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound .
And they get a picture of their whale too .
So this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Nico &apos;s message .
This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
( Audio ) Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . Bye .
Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that he likes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the crossword puzzles that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more message from Nico .
This is the Christmas message from Nico .
&#91; Beep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so busy because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a whale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a merry Christmas .
So have a nice Christmas , and bye-bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
His voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create .
I feel lucky . Kids like Nico are the best readers , and they deserve the best stories we can give them .
Thank you very much .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Phew , phew , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Usually when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scream out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( Vvvwow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Whoa ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
Well , what I &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets — ( Portamento ) — and you can get it really low .
And with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
( Tones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
( Flourish ... Beep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I startle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( Blip ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
We &apos;re going to do a song by David Mash called &quot; &quot; Listen : the Words Are Gone , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .
( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ; there are so many .
And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin .
It was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , Léon Theremin — he also was a musician besides an inventor — he came up with the idea for making the theremin , I think , when he was working on some shortwave radios .
And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( Screeching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pitches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now .
And a lot of times , even kids nowadays , they &apos;ll make reference to a theremin by going , &quot; &quot; Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibrato gets out of hand .
You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( Tone rising out of key ) — and breathing will make it ...
( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
And if I go to a club and play a gig , people are like , &quot; Here , have some drinks on us ! &quot;
And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Teetering tones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
it &apos;s similar to being a vocalist , except instead of it coming out of your throat , you &apos;re controlling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ; you &apos;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .
You just have to always adjust to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
I think we will play another tune now .
I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; Lush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
( Music ) ( Applause )
It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his &quot; &quot; I Have A Dream &quot; &quot; speech .
But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a lasting one that remains .
I was born in a family full of colors .
My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone .
He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents .
The matriarch , my grandma , has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair .
My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian , with a pinch of hazel and honey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
She has two sisters .
One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other , also adopted , more on the beige side , like a pancake .
( Laughter ) Growing up in this family , color was never important for me .
Outside home , however , things were different soon .
Color had many other meanings .
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil .
I was made of flesh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
My skin was brown , and people said I was black .
I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
Later , when I took my cousin to school , I was usually taken for the nanny .
By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the maid .
I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends .
And many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elevator .
Because in the end , with this color and this hair , I cannot belong to some places .
In some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
However , something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling .
Years later I married a Spaniard .
But not any Spaniard .
I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt .
( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
What will be the color of your children ?
As you can understand , this is my last concern .
But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
And that is how Humanae was born .
Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the untrue white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
I portray the subjects in a white background .
Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette , Pantone .
I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain .
The snowball started to roll .
The project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
just happened .
And among them , my favorite : when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the Forbes list , to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat .
In Paris , from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter .
And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro .
All kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or terminally ill .
We all together build Humanae .
Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
When modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
Or does it have to do with our origin , nationality or bank account ?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people .
It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label .
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me , &quot; &quot; Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence , as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway .
So your work has a very special place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereotype , a box .
Perhaps we should stop .
Instead of framing , ask the individual , &apos; How would you label yourself ? &apos; Then I would say , &apos; Hi . I &apos;m Massiel .
I &apos;m a Dominican-Dutch , I grew up in a mixed family and I &apos;m a bisexual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Besides these unexpected and touching reactions , Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields .
Just to show you some examples , illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies .
It &apos;s a collection of faces .
Researchers in the fields of anthropology , physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity , optophysiology , face recognition or Alzheimer &apos;s .
One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs , one of the most relevant political publications .
And talking about foreign affairs , I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
teachers .
They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
As an individual , as Angélica , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist .
All the frustration , fear and loneliness that I once felt ...
becomes love .
The last country — the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Tweets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
It all started back in 1977 .
I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses — and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
It was an experimental education program .
It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention — kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
His name is Chris Farina .
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the eerie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
You know the one .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 — but something interactive .
And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
There are four countries around the board .
The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cabinet .
There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
So I also have in the game a saboteur — some child — it &apos;s basically a troublemaker — and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; Fourth-graders understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
The students run the game .
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
John Hunter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
And so I apologize to them as well .
I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
( Chatter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her girlfriends she said that .
That &apos;s a breach there .
And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
( Laughter ) They are the toughest opponents .
And we were very upset .
I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County — and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
&quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
He says , &quot; &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
There was no way they could win .
And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time — there was about a minute left — and despair just settled over the room .
I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
Some games are more about warfare .
But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
If only .
And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
His village is near Mogadishu .
Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
Maybe a year passes , nothing .
One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
He is introduced to this young woman .
He eventually gets married .
He starts this new life .
He has a purpose in life .
One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
He was waiting .
He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
They pretty much do nothing .
I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Madina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
Would I have become a terrorist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
One of the young men in the room was Aden .
He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
There were no jobs , no opportunities .
I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
They sought people like him out .
But his story takes a different route .
In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
He started a motorbike company .
He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .
He &apos;s actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad .
If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
He started a landscaping and design floral company .
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
They had never really thought about starting up a business .
They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
I believe he is selling hope .
His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burniss Travis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano . ( Applause )
So the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
It is really a sacred space .
And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Titi Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
You have no time for projected ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the bandstand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F. ( Music )
See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
If you played an E.
See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
If you played an F # though , ( Dissonance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a melody out of it .
The texture changed in the drums this time .
It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
So there is no mistake .
The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micromanage in jazz .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
This is a science of listening .
It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
( Music ) Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
Thank you .

( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
So most everyone watches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , berate it .
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We &apos;re talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years .
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .
As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel awe , we feel pity .
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
Animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
We went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
And on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern .
And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen .
Okay , here we go .
So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane .
Why ?
The Cuban Missile Crisis , JFK is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , MLK is shot , Bobby Kennedy is shot , Watergate .
Look what happens .
In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
Moral ambiguity takes off .
They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a telegenic president , is in office .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran-Contra , the Challenger disaster , Chernobyl .
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; Andy Griffith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
Irreverence starts to rise .
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gomer Pyle &quot; &quot; — in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
What &apos;s number one ?
The socially irreverent hippie show , &quot; Rowan and Martin &apos;s Laugh-In . &quot;
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Viewers had responded dramatically .
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
When you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ?
It means in the 1966 television season , The &quot; &quot; Smothers Brothers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presidency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
Now look at this .
The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
You have &quot; &quot; All in the Family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top-10 for the entire 70s — &quot; MAS * H. &quot;
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration .
Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .
You &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
No . In the 70s you have the bellwether show &quot; &quot; The Bionic Woman &quot; &quot; that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Million-Dollar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s Angels . &quot; &quot; Another spike in the 1980s — another spike in shows about control and power .
What were those shows ?
Glamorous and rich .
&quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
The 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cheers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfeld . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
But look : X marks the spot .
In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succumbs to judgment once and for all .
Why not ?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
What do people want in their TV then ?
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
No , they want judgment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
I can choose the next American Idol . You &apos;re fired .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom .
The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Beaver . &quot; &quot; Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
Maude Findlay , the epitome of the irreverent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even menopause on TV .
The 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington .
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .
This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
So to you all , the women of TEDWomen , the men of TEDWomen , the global audiences of TEDWomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as viewers , through your collective social consciences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
So thanks very much .
( Applause )
Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
And I &apos;ll quote three people : Vannevar Bush , Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee .
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is Vannevar Bush .
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
And in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly .
And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
We don &apos;t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth .
The brain works by association .
With one item in its thought , it snaps instantly to the next item .
And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process .
And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
And the memex would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
Now this was in 1945 .
A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
And nobody knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was invented .
And he proposed this machine called the memex .
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S. Air Force officer .
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
And by the mid-60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
He built a system .
The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
And in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called NLS for oN-Line System .
And this is Doug Engelbart .
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968 .
What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstrated this system .
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
So this is where the mouse came from as well .
So this is Doug Engelbart .
The trouble with Doug Engelbart &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
And my company , OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh .
And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
And this began to get a head of steam .
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .
The magazines started to cover it .
Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext .
We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version .
And our PC version became quite mature .
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html .
We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks .
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990 .
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you Ian Ritchie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day .
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he &apos;s not going to do this .
So we didn &apos;t do it .
In the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .
In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web .
And I saw it , and I thought , yep , that &apos;s it .
And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in Edinburgh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker .
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company .
There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles .
There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling &apos;s Harry Potter , I guess .
On the other hand , there &apos;s Marc Andreessen who wrote the world &apos;s first browser for the World Wide Web .
And according to Fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
But is he happy ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
He was not a political prisoner .
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; inaudible name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; Khrew , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have defended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d miscarried .
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
But Cambodia is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; inaudible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mumbling
and grumbling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . Lawyers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
It &apos;s not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice .
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vishna . He &apos;s a 4-year-old boy .
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Doesn &apos;t say a word — just rolls away with it .
Doesn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there .
You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a stink .
But there &apos;s no agenda .
There &apos;s no information about why you were invited to the meeting .
And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
( Laughter ) The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s an involuntary reflex — ding , click , bing — it &apos;s in your calendar , &quot; &quot; Gotta go , I &apos;m already late for a meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Meetings are important , right ?
And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
And a well-run meeting can yield really positive , actionable results .
But between globalization and pervasive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dramatically over the last few years .
And we &apos;re miserable . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re miserable not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good meeting , it &apos;s because of MAS , our Mindless Accept Syndrome , which is a self-inflicted wound .
Actually , I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic .
Let me tell you why .
A couple of years ago , I put a video on Youtube , and in the video , I acted out every terrible conference call you &apos;ve ever been on .
It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings .
The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck .
And everybody leaves very angry .
It &apos;s kind of funny .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — Hi , who just joined ?
Hi , it &apos;s Joe . I &apos;m working from home today .
( Laughter ) Hi , Joe . Thanks for joining us today , great .
I was just saying , we have a lot of people on the call we &apos;d like to get through , so let &apos;s skip the roll call and I &apos;m gonna dive right in .
Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — ( Laughter ) Hi , who just joined ?
No ? I thought I heard a beep . ( Laughter ) Sound familiar ?
Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
And in fact , some of the biggest companies in the world , companies that you &apos;ve heard of but I won &apos;t name , have asked for my permission to use this video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company .
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
It made me laugh until I cried .
And cried . And I cried some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My daily life until retirement or death , sigh . &quot;
These are real quotes and it &apos;s real sad .
But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
It &apos;s right at our fingertips , literally .
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No MAS !
First of all , the next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , click the tentative button !
It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
Then , get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting .
And if we do this often enough , and we do it respectfully , people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations .
And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it .
People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with .
People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours .
And they just might bring your chair back , too . ( Laughter ) No MAS !
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
&quot; End with an inspiring call to action . &quot;
No .
That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
In fact , if you overuse those devices , you &apos;re just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative .
But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a ringside seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers , like these .
And it &apos;s this : Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners &apos; minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
Let me show you what I mean .
Here &apos;s Haley .
( Video ) Presenter : Haley Van Dyck !
They &apos;re literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
There &apos;s something even more startling happening .
Let &apos;s take a look inside Haley &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle .
But look here , right here — a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea .
And incredibly , this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds , just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .
But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
CA : Chimamanda Adichie — people are more than a single identity .
CA : Your mind is teeming with ideas , and not just randomly .
They &apos;re carefully linked together .
Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
It &apos;s how you navigate the world .
And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
So , for example , if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react like this .
So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial .
You need them to be as reliable as possible — a guide , to the scary but wonderful real world out there .
Now , different people &apos;s worldviews can be dramatically different .
For example , how does your worldview react when you see this image : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you look at me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an expert , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
Or &quot; &quot; oppressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brainwashed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; ?
CA : Whatever your answer , there are millions of people out there who would react very differently .
So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
If communicated properly , they &apos;re capable of changing , forever , how someone thinks about the world , and shaping their actions both now and well into the future .
Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
Ideas are complex things ; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you &apos;re most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
You have to give context , share examples , make it vivid .
So pick one idea , and make it the through-line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
Two , give your listeners a reason to care .
Curiosity .
Stir your audience &apos;s curiosity .
Use intriguing , provocative questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs explaining .
If you can reveal a disconnection in someone &apos;s worldview , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
And once you &apos;ve sparked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
You start where they are .
Now , metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listener already understands .
For example , when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word processor to edit DNA .
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds .
It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
Four , here &apos;s the final tip : Make your idea worth sharing .
By that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Who does this idea benefit ? &quot;
And I need you to be honest with the answer .
If the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently , then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk , one that can be a gift to them and to all of us .
Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
Students lack perseverance .
They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
This is really destructive .
David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
It applies equally to math .
Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
I believe in real life .
And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
So I hope you can see .
I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
It &apos;s tedious .
Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
This has been a lot of fun .
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
Sort of an interesting thing .
It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
I was born and raised in North Korea .
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty , I was always loved and cared for first , because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
But then the great famine began in 1994 .
I was four years old .
My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
But even as a child , I could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
I saw my father wither away and die .
In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
But that is no way to survive .
I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
I was not uncommon .
Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
That hope kept me alive .
I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
Hope kept me alive .
Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
I was 16 years old .
I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
I thought more people would help me .
But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
At one point , my father gave up on me .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
You have to choose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
In North Korea , I made it myself .
Hope brought me to America .
But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
I did not come here by myself .
I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
Many people helped me along the way to get here .
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
This is my message to you .
Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
And I — oh , gosh .
I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
AH : Sure , please .
JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
The reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
So for example , in the case of Ticketmaster , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
( Laughter ) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
But then I started feeling bad .
See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs .
So then I started feeling bad .
( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
So see , here &apos;s the thing .
While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
So let me explain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
It gives you an image for every page of the book .
This is an image with text for every page of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
That &apos;s using a technology called OCR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
So this is how the system works .
And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
So for example , Ticketmaster .
So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet .
( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
So funny things can happen .
For example , we presented this word .
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christians &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
So we get this . ( Text : bad christians ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
( Laughter ) Oops . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
JohnEdwards.com ( Text : Damn liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cute . ( Text : clenched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funnier .
( Text : stoned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg . ( Laughter )
Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA : 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Severin Hacker .
Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
So I posed the question to my graduate student .
By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
First of all , translating the Web .
So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
A large fraction of it is in English .
If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mistakes .
Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
Actually it was a forum post .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
So he &apos;s just explaining something .
Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
( Text : At often , the goat-time install a error is vomit . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
( Text : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the dragon ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
( Text : Please apologize for your stupidity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
So back to the question .
So we need people to translate the whole Web .
So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
We could do that .
Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
So it would be very expensive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals , and that is language education .
So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
So people really , really want to learn a new language .
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Duolingo — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
People really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
So people really do learn a language .
And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
As opposed to learning with made-up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
So people really do learn a language .
But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
So let me show you one example .
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
The top is the German .
The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
This is totally biased towards the rich .
Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
So this is how we could monetize this .
Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
So thank you .
( Applause )
In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians .
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
Now , she had no idea what to look for .
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
Had they consumed colored drinks ?
Did they eat fish and chips ?
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant .
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 .
People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
In fact , she need not have hurried .
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women .
The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
So , how did she know that she was right ?
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
George frankly preferred numbers to people .
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought disconfirmation .
Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
Alice and George were very good at conflict .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
So how do organizations think ?
Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
Because it does take skill and practice , too .
If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
They think of him as a leader .
So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
Openness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

Thank you .
Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania .
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
All sisters , excepting me .
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
Like everyone else , we grew maize .
One year our fortune turned very bad .
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
My family ate one meal per day , at night .
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
The food passes through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
So I went to a library .
I read books , science books , especially physics .
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
It was one light at first .
And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
I had never seen an airplane before .
I had never slept in a hotel .
So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
God bless .
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
Thank you .

In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
This is Alfred Gonzalez .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is Bjorn Sundin .
This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
They sell certificates .
What do you do with certificates ?
Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and issue rogue certificates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
The company headquarters are right here .
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will tap your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Privacy is implied .
Privacy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .

I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Values are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
Probably not .
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
And morality relates to these truths .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
And these await our discovery .
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
The concept of physical health is undefined .
As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
Why would we think this ?
Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
Well , who are we not to say this ?
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Edward Witten .
He &apos;s a string theorist .
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
Language seems to be really important here .
When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
But can you reconcile that ?
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
SH : Really an honor . Thank you .

( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
This one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her Broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
And after a few moments , her therapist tries a new tack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she sings , in one descending scale , she sings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
And it &apos;s a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug , one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .
And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
and how late-stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes , these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with disfiguring cancers .
I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor , that doctor without borders .
On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic .
It was my first audition , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra , to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
But a year later , I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician .
Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard , but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s , was treated with thorazine at Bellevue , and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later .
Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The Soloist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
Playing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill .
But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel , I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony , bringing the light of music into the very darkest places , performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row , performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane .
After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the footlights , out of the tuxedo tails , the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brahms , or chamber music by Beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Keats , the Romantic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
And Keats said , &quot; &quot; Beauty is truth , and truth beauty .
That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not slept in weeks .
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
So I would walk around in a daze during the day .
I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
And so we started talking about this .
And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
And the idea was to put McSweeney &apos;s — McSweeney &apos;s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this mural , that &apos;s a Chris Ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
So we rented this space .
And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look — while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate supply-like .
Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
Up at the top , you see the eyepatch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch , and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mitzvahs and whatever .
So we opened this place . And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Practical Joking with Pirates . &quot;
While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle .
Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari , a longtime San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
She took over as executive director .
Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored .
So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
So there &apos;s no stigma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
There &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at McSweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
And that makes a happy family .
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster .
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
So this is one of the books that they do .
Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic . &quot;
And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
So then we still had more tutors to use .
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
Whoever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
And that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Everett Middle School Writers &apos; Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight-Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages — English and Spanish .
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
It &apos;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
We had a big party at the end .
This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
We sell all the student books .
Where else would you put them , right ?
So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money .
So it was paying the rent .
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
And it became a gateway to the community .
People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
So the store actually did really well .
But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
So , knowing the crime-fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company .
This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Costco for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
These are all handmade .
These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts .
So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
This is a secret identity kit .
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Hoboken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
So , this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that .
So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
This is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
You can read this quote .
Addicted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
Came in . Got this concentrated attention .
And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
He &apos;s now been published in five books .
He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super-Has-Beens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Penguin Balboa , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers .
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-Eleven would be .
Leeches . Mammoth chunks . They even have their own Slurpee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Order . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pittsfield , Massachusetts ; Ink Spot in Cincinnati ; Youth Speaks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin Bat Cave in Austin ; Fighting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Roddy Doyle , this will be open in April .
Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
Profound leaps forward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
We created a website .
I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
Always let the teachers lead the way .
They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureaucratically untenable .
You can do and use the skills that you have .
The schools need you . The teachers need you .
Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
Thank you so much .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day .
And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hallelujah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laughed .
And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
That ’ s a big thing in California .
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
And so I argued with people about that , I argued and I argued .
I called my parents up .
I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
They ’ re back in Philadelphia .
And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mothers are like that .
And so , on my 27th birthday I decided , because I argued so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
And so I did .
I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
And then I would launch in .
Well , that just ended communication .
So on this first day I actually listened .
And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
Well , that lasted 17 years .
Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
It ’ s only 500 miles .
And I went into the Registrar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
I had a newspaper clipping .
&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
You don ’ t … ?
We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
And my father came out , he was so proud .
He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor ’ s degree ?
You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana .
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
There are two stories in Montana .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Register for one credit .
You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , South America .
So I did that .
He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate — you ’ re matriculating , so you can use the library .
And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
All the students sat around and they went ...
( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
They had to take that class with me .
Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a handsaw . &quot;
&quot; Well , you can ’ t clearcut with a ... &quot;
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about selective forestry . &quot;
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
And so I went on .
My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hunched my shoulder , I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin .
I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
No one was interested in oil spills .
But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
My dad came out again .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
And I ’ m thanking you , and I &apos;m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
And that ’ s communication .
And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
Well , my journey kept going on .
My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
How could that be , how could that be ?
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
I started talking because I had studied environment .
I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
And so that ’ s the message that I had .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motorized vehicles .
I was walking through El Dorado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in Venezuela , and I don ’ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; Pasaporte , pasaporte , &quot; &quot; and with an M16 pointed at me .
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
What possessed me to say this thing ?
The road turned into the jungle .
I didn ’ t get shot .
And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Almighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
Now how could that be ?
Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador .
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
We have to change now .
As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists .
So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the latest episode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — longest running soap opera , which is cricket .
And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue .
And like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
And that &apos;s exactly what cricket has done .
It &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20-over game .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
Cricket wasn &apos;t always this speed-driven generations game .
There was a time when you played cricket , you played timeless test matches , when you played on till the game got over .
And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March .
And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town , which is a two-hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
So , the match was ended in between .
And one of the English batsmen said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days , so you don &apos;t play on Sundays . And one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket : because we had about the same pace of life .
( Laughter ) The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
You fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
Princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers .
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
Take a look : You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
( Laughter ) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges — that &apos;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time .
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket .
And then an enormous accident took place .
In Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
And we won this World Cup in 1983 .
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game , and we played it virtually every day .
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere .
But there was another big date .
1983 was when we won the World Cup .
1991 , &apos; 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
And so we allowed multinationals into India .
We cut customs duties , we reduced import duties , and we got all the multinationals coming in , with multinational budgets , who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
And there are only two vehicles in India — one real , one scripted .
The scripted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cricket .
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
And so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in .
Television started covering cricket . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
And then another big accident happened in our cricket .
England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
Thank God for them .
( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see .
India didn &apos;t want to play the T20 World Cup .
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin .
And then something very dramatic happened .
We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
( Crowd cheering ) The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder .
Announcer : And Zishan takes it ! India wins !
What a match for a Twenty20 final .
India , the world champions .
( Cheering ) India , T20 champions .
But what a game we had , M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air , but Misbah-ul-Haq , what a player .
A massive , massive success : India , the world TT champions .
Harsha Bhogle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket .
The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast .
( Laughter ) If he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
And thankfully for all of us , the English are very good at inventing things , and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
( Laughter ) And so England invented T20 cricket , and allowed India to hijack it .
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T20 league .
Six weeks , city versus city .
It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
The other was Indian cricket .
Now , suddenly we had to support city leagues .
But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West .
America is a home of leagues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some glitzy leagues here in India . &quot;
But was India ready for it ?
Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized .
It was never promoted , it was never sold — it was organized .
And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
All of a sudden , you had that happening .
( Music ) An opening ceremony to match every other .
This was an India that was buying Corvettes . This was an India that was buying Jaguar .
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand &apos;s population twice over .
So , it was a different India .
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
And so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .
Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes .
They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
And so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time .
And they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues .
But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized .
So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Manchester United style promotion , but very Mumbai style promotion . Take a look .
( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .
All along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .
Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot — if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn &apos;t go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad .
This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
So , the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago , overnight . And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X. &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Fine , you play to date X , minus one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game ,
went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet — first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time .
( Laughter ) Never would India have thought on this scale before .
Never would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
There is cricket and the movies .
And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs .
And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta .
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket .
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more .
And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that follows — if you did well , you got a hug from Preity Zinta .
So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching Preity Zinta .
( Music ) And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd .
We &apos;d all seen matches in Kolkata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Shah Rukh , with the Bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata — not for India , but for Kolkata .
But take a look at this .
( Music ) An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they &apos;d won in Kolkata .
Can you imagine ?
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta &apos;s team . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pakistan in here .
I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
We can play cricket together , we can be friends .
So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
( Applause ) There was criticism too because they said , &quot; &quot; Players are being bought and sold ?
Are they grain ?
Are they cattle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auction , you see .
How do you fix a price for a player ?
And so the auction that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so-and-so player . &quot;
There it is .
( Music ) Auctioneer : Going at 1,500,000 dollars . Chennai .
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars .
HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day — so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
The best Indian players who played every test match — every one of the internationals , the top of the line players — standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year .
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days &apos; work .
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , and I &apos;m earning more than the footballers , wow . &quot; &quot; And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India .
Could you have imagined that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
What India was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today .
IPL became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks .
But we did it . You know why ?
Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching — the huge consuming class — everybody came to watch the cricket .
We &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in India , which is a pity , but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beggars , snake charmers , filth , Delhi belly — people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .
And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
Cricketers all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
And that felt good , you know ?
We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Delhi belly in there anymore .
There &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules .
Right so , finally , an English game that India usurped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
You can &apos;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
So that &apos;s what T20 is doing .
Hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
( Applause )
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
Domo arigato gozaimashita .
So I started working with refugees because I wanted to make a difference , and making a difference starts with telling their stories .
Who bombed your house ?
Who killed your son ?
Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town , and the armed gangs were approaching your house ?
A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn &apos;t hesitate when his life was in imminent danger .
He took his high school diploma , and later he told me why .
He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that diploma .
His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; Every day , I would say to him every morning , &apos; Honey , please don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he insisted , she said , &quot; I would hug him as if it were for the last time . &quot;
But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all afraid , but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got terrible news .
It was time to flee .
They left that day , right away , in their car , Hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers .
And they would cross the border into Lebanon , where they would find peace .
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony .
They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field , and this is Hany &apos;s brother Ashraf , who plays outside .
And that day , they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world , in a country , Lebanon , that is tiny .
It only has four million citizens , and there are one million Syrian refugees living there .
There &apos;s not a town , a city or a village that is not host to Syrian refugees .
Think about it this way , proportionately .
It would be as if the entire population of Germany , 80 million people , would flee to the United States in just three years .
Half of the entire population of Syria is now uprooted , most of them inside the country .
Six and a half million people have fled for their lives .
Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries , and only a small proportion , as you see , have moved on to Europe .
What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan .
And most troubling of all is that only 20 percent of Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon .
And yet , Syrian refugee children , all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives .
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred .
I &apos;m reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq , and I met this girl , and I thought , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s beautiful , &quot; &quot; and I went up to her and asked her , &quot; Can I take your picture ? &quot;
And she said yes , but she refused to smile .
I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children , a generation isolated and frustrated .
And yet , look at what they fled : utter destruction , buildings , industries , schools , roads , homes .
Hany &apos;s home was also destroyed .
This will need to be rebuilt by architects , by engineers , by electricians .
Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge .
Shouldn &apos;t this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake , the societies in exile , the refugees ?
Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return .
You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state .
Well far from it .
With wars going on and on , the average time a refugee will spend in exile is 17 years .
We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf .
But I &apos;ll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day .
He said to me , &quot; If I am not a student , I am nothing . &quot;
Hany is one of 50 million people uprooted in this world today .
Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced .
So while we &apos;re making sweeping progress in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes .
And there are more and more victims .
Every day , on average , by the end of this day , 32,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes — 32,000 people .
They flee across borders like this one .
We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan , and this is a typical day .
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats , risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe .
This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized — most of the people drowned — and he told us , &quot; &quot; Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you , where nobody humiliates you , and where nobody kills you . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that should be the minimum .
How about a place of healing , of learning , and even opportunity ?
Americans and Europeans have the impression that proportionally huge numbers of refugees are coming to their country , but the reality is that 86 percent , the vast majority of refugees , are living in the developing world , in countries struggling with their own insecurity , with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty .
So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees .
And all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border .
( Applause ) Thank you .
But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive .
We can help them thrive .
We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end .
Rather , as centers of excellence , where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation .
It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m reminded of the terrible war in Somalia that has been raging on for 22 years .
And imagine living in this camp .
I visited this camp .
It &apos;s in Djibouti , neighboring Somalia , and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there .
It was dusty and it was terribly hot .
And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter , and I went up and talked to her .
And I asked her the questions that grown-ups ask kids , like , &quot; &quot; What is your favorite subject ? &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; &quot; And this is when her face turned blank , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I have no future .
And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;
And I also thought , what a waste .
A boy named Jacob Atem had a different chance , but not before he experienced terribly tragedy .
He watched — this is in Sudan — as his village — he was only seven years old — burned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day .
Only his cousin survived , and the two of them walked for seven months — this is boys like him — chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs , and they finally made it to refugee camps where they found safety , and he would spend the next seven years in Kenya in a refugee camp .
But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States , and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university .
So I want to take you back to Hany .
When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage , he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me .
He wrote : &quot; &quot; I miss myself , my friends , times of reading novels or writing poems , birds and tea in the morning .
My room , my books , myself , and everything that was making me smile .
Oh , oh , I had so many dreams that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity .
Leave them abandoned , and they risk exploitation and abuse , and leave them unskilled and uneducated , and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries .
I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world .
The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace , and it &apos;s the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence .
Hany is at a tipping point .
University is a luxury .
Hany &apos;s story is a tragedy , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way .
Thank you .

Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
Take nothing : do no harm .
I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
So the equation is conceptual .
Still it works to help us understand the problem .
So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T2 — where it reduces impact ?
I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
Linear : take , make , waste .
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
More carpet per man-hour .
Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
We have measured our progress very rigorously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
We have diverted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
We call it Cool Carpet .
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
It is practical , and pretty too .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
We call this Mission Zero .
And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
Here is the business case for sustainability .
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
Costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
It is a better business model .
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
We literally gained market share .
We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
And now the challenge is in execution .
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
Who is that person ?
Not you . Not I.
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
A wise friend introduced us two .
And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
Knowing you has changed my thinking .
For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
Begin , I will .
The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
For you , it &apos;s your call .
Thank you .
