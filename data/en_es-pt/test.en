__es__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__es__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__es__ While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__es__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__es__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__es__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__es__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__es__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__es__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__es__ There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
__es__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__es__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__es__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__es__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__es__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__es__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__es__ One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
__es__ ( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
__es__ Death : Adam ?
__es__ AO : Yeah .
__es__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
__es__ AO : Who is this ?
__es__ Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
__es__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__es__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
__es__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__es__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__es__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__es__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__es__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__es__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__es__ One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__es__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
__es__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__es__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__es__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__es__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__es__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__es__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__es__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__es__ Thank you very much .

__es__ ( Applause ) Michael Pemberton . ( Applause )
__es__ Thank you so much .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care , for childcare reasons , pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
__es__ Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds : veterans , military spouses , retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats .
__es__ This disconnect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
__es__ He &apos;s a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children .
__es__ The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks .
__es__ That &apos;s the longest career break that I &apos;m aware of .
__es__ Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
__es__ I met Tracy in June of 2011 , when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around .
__es__ The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house .
__es__ I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__es__ I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversations that don &apos;t go anywhere .
__es__ Expect that , and don &apos;t be discouraged by it .
__es__ And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is frozen in time .
__es__ What I mean by this is , when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past , the people with whom you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your career break .
__es__ And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
__es__ So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this .
__es__ This is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan .
__es__ Or here I am in the kitchen .
__es__ But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this .
__es__ They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work .
__es__ And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news .
__es__ My background is in finance , and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children .
__es__ I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here &apos;s why .
__es__ Think about our life stage : for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
__es__ We &apos;re in a more settled time of life .
__es__ We have great work experience .
__es__ We have a more mature perspective .
__es__ We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employer &apos;s expense .
__es__ Plus we have an energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
__es__ On the flip side , I speak with employers , and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers .
__es__ The first one is , employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete .
__es__ Now , I can tell you , having been technologically obsolete myself at one point , that it &apos;s a temporary condition .
__es__ It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the commands are the same .
__es__ And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
__es__ And they do .
__es__ The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they &apos;re worried that relaunchers don &apos;t know what they want to do .
__es__ I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
__es__ That &apos;s not the employer &apos;s job .
__es__ Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
__es__ I saw a returning engineer , a nontraditional reentry candidate , apply for an entry-level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
__es__ I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs .
__es__ And at this point , hundreds of people have participated .
__es__ These internships are paid , and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries .
__es__ And now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers .
__es__ Now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
__es__ This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
__es__ Think about how far we have come .
__es__ Before this , most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all .
__es__ But now , not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind , but you can &apos;t even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé .
__es__ This is the mark of real change , of true institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers , we can solve it for other career transitioners too .
__es__ In fact , an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program .
__es__ And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a retiree internship program .
__es__ Different pool , same concept .
__es__ So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro .
__es__ Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__es__ Well , one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy , and it was an accounting job in a finance department .
__es__ This was in the fall of 2011 .
__es__ Tracy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
__es__ So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role , she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best .
__es__ Fast forward to 2015 , Tracy &apos;s been promoted .
__es__ They &apos;ve paid for her to get her MBA at night .
__es__ She &apos;s even hired another relauncher to work for her .
__es__ Tracy &apos;s temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer .
__es__ Now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
__es__ But in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , don &apos;t hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
__es__ Be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
__es__ Thank you .

__es__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__es__ Now I work in the solar technology industry .
__es__ And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
__es__ ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
__es__ It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
__es__ Huh . Hang on a moment .
__es__ It might take a moment to load .
__es__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
__es__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__es__ ( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
__es__ Okay . ( Laughter )
__es__ Solar technology is ...
__es__ Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
__es__ Okay . Thank you very much .

__es__ It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
__es__ I was working at the ACLU as the organization &apos;s science advisor .
__es__ So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen &apos;s office .
__es__ Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years , so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights .
__es__ I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck .
__es__ I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties — super interesting .
__es__ But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way , in a way that could really make a difference .
__es__ So Chris cut right to the chase , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
__es__ &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination , and reproductive technologies , and biobanking , and ...
__es__ oh , there &apos;s this really cool issue , functional MRI and using it for lie detection , and ...
__es__ oh , and of course , there &apos;s gene patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; Gene patents ? &quot;
__es__ &quot; Yes , you know , patents on human genes . &quot;
__es__ &quot; &quot; No !
__es__ You &apos;re telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body ?
__es__ That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
__es__ And 20 minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
__es__ &quot; Oh my god ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we sue ? &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
__es__ I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
__es__ So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit .
__es__ First , we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene .
__es__ Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of these are to so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — namely , a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell .
__es__ Gene patent proponents say , &quot; &quot; See ? We didn &apos;t patent the gene in your body , we patented an isolated gene . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated .
__es__ And the patents weren &apos;t just to a particular gene that they isolated , but on every possible version of that gene .
__es__ So what does that mean ?
__es__ That means that you can &apos;t give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mutations , without permission of the patent holder .
__es__ It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing .
__es__ Allowing patent holders , often private companies , to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients .
__es__ Consider Abigail , a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome , a serious heart condition that , if left untreated , can result in sudden death .
__es__ The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome .
__es__ But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it .
__es__ So another lab tried to offer the test , but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement .
__es__ So as a result , for 2 years , no test was available .
__es__ During that time , Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT .
__es__ Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
__es__ But was there a way we could challenge them ?
__es__ Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases , that certain things are not patent eligible .
__es__ You can &apos;t patent products of nature — the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
__es__ And you can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
__es__ It seemed to us that DNA , the most fundamental structure of life , that codes for the production of all of our proteins , is both a product of nature and a law of nature , regardless of whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube .
__es__ As we delved into this issue , we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts — scientists , medical professionals , lawyers , patent lawyers .
__es__ Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
__es__ All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero .
__es__ Why is that ?
__es__ Well , the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years .
__es__ There were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
__es__ The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo , the biotech industry had grown up around this practice , and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress , and had gone absolutely nowhere .
__es__ So the bottom line : courts just weren &apos;t going to be willing to overturn these patents .
__es__ Now , neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge , and hearing , &quot; &quot; Being right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; seemed all the more reason to take on this fight .
__es__ So we set out to build our case .
__es__ Now , patent cases tend to be : Company A sues Company B over some really narrow , obscure technical issue .
__es__ We weren &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bigger than that .
__es__ This was about scientific freedom , medical progress , the rights of patients .
__es__ So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case — more like a civil rights case .
__es__ We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation .
__es__ We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics , a company that &apos;s based in Salt Lake City , Utah .
__es__ Myriad held patents on two genes , the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes .
__es__ Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer .
__es__ Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States .
__es__ It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop .
__es__ It charged a lot of money for its test — over 3,000 dollars .
__es__ It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community .
__es__ And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
__es__ It has been estimated that during that period , for several years , as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer — a negative test result that should have been positive .
__es__ This is Kathleen Maxian .
__es__ Kathleen &apos;s sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad .
__es__ The test was negative .
__es__ The family was relieved .
__es__ That meant that Eileen &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other members of her family didn &apos;t need to be tested .
__es__ But two years later , Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer .
__es__ It turned out that Kathleen &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result .
__es__ Had Eileen received the proper result , Kathleen would have then been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
__es__ Once we settled on Myriad , we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems .
__es__ One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
__es__ So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention , and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
__es__ How is DNA isolated , and why isn &apos;t that an invention ?
__es__ We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts , trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately .
__es__ And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors , like gold .
__es__ So isolating DNA — it &apos;s like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed .
__es__ You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
__es__ It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain ; you still can &apos;t patent it , it &apos;s still gold .
__es__ And the gold , once it &apos;s extracted , can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the mountain ; you can make jewelry out of it for example — still can &apos;t patent the gold , it &apos;s still gold .
__es__ So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
__es__ We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York , and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet .
__es__ In March 2010 , Judge Sweet issued his opinion — 152 pages — and a complete victory for our side .
__es__ In reading the opinion , we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case .
__es__ I mean , our brief — it was pretty good , but not this good .
__es__ How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
__es__ We just could not comprehend how this had happened .
__es__ So it turned out , Judge Sweet &apos;s clerk working for him at the time , was not just a lawyer — he was a scientist .
__es__ He was not just a scientist — he had a PhD in molecular biology .
__es__ ( Laughter ) What an incredible stroke of luck !
__es__ Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
__es__ And here things got really interesting .
__es__ First , in a pivotal moment of this case , the US government switched sides .
__es__ So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad &apos;s side .
__es__ But now in direct opposition to its own patent office , the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court &apos;s opinion , and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible .
__es__ This was a really big deal , totally unexpected .
__es__ The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases , and it has a reputation for being very , very pro-patent .
__es__ So even with this remarkable development , we expected to lose .
__es__ And we did .
__es__ Sort of .
__es__ Ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
__es__ But the two judges who ruled against us , did so for completely different reasons .
__es__ The first one , Judge Lourie , made up his own novel , biological theory — totally wrong .
__es__ ( Laughter ) He decided Myriad had created a new chemical — made absolutely no sense .
__es__ Myriad didn &apos;t even argue this , so it came out of the blue .
__es__ The other , Judge Moore , said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
__es__ But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Judge Bryson , agreed with us .
__es__ So now we sought review by the Supreme Court .
__es__ And when you petition the Supreme Court , you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer .
__es__ Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph , like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses , &quot; wherein this &quot; and &quot; therefore that . &quot;
__es__ We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
__es__ Four words : Are human genes patentable ?
__es__ Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
__es__ I think you have to say , &apos; Is isolated DNA patentable ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nope .
__es__ I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
__es__ The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives , and it agreed to hear ours .
__es__ The day of the oral argument arrives , and it was really , really exciting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse .
__es__ Two breast cancer organizations , Breast Cancer Action and FORCE , had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps .
__es__ Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway , moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career .
__es__ I was clearly more nervous than he was .
__es__ But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces : our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories , the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical , patient advocacy , environmental and religious organizations , who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case .
__es__ Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the co-discoverer of DNA himself , James Watson , who had submitted a brief to the court , where he referred to gene patenting as &quot; &quot; lunacy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake .
__es__ The argument itself was riveting .
__es__ Chris argued brilliantly .
__es__ But for me , the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA , through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges , very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years .
__es__ Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon .
__es__ Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
__es__ And in one of my absolutely favorite moments , Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day , but I could never have anticipated the outcome : nine to zero .
__es__ &quot; &quot; A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature , and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated .
__es__ And furthermore , Myriad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; Within 24 hours of the decision , five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes .
__es__ Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad &apos;s .
__es__ Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering .
__es__ But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
__es__ It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States .
__es__ It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation .
__es__ And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail , Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need .
__es__ A few weeks after the court issued its decision , I received a small package in the mail .
__es__ ( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
__es__ Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
__es__ The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many twists and turns along the way .
__es__ A little luck certainly helped , but it was the communities that we bridged , the alliances that we created , that made pigs fly .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__es__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__es__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__es__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__es__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__es__ Where are economic networks ?
__es__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__es__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__es__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__es__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
__es__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__es__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
__es__ We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
__es__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__es__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__es__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__es__ And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
__es__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__es__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__es__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__es__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__es__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
__es__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__es__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__es__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__es__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__es__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
__es__ The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__es__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__es__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__es__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__es__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__es__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__es__ And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
__es__ So this is how it works .
__es__ This is a video prototype .
__es__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__es__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__es__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
__es__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__es__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__es__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__es__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__es__ So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__es__ So this is a very early prototype .
__es__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__es__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
__es__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__es__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__es__ So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__es__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__es__ On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__es__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__es__ Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__es__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__es__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__es__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__es__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__es__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__es__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__es__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__es__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
__es__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
__es__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__es__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__es__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__es__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__es__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__es__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__es__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__es__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__es__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__es__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__es__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__es__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__es__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__es__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__es__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__es__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
__es__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__es__ So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__es__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__es__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__es__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__es__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
__es__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__es__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__es__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ OK , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
__es__ And specifically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love .
__es__ Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this metaphor , falling , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
__es__ I don &apos;t know about you , but when I conceptualize this metaphor , what I picture is straight out of a cartoon — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s walking down the sidewalk , without realizing it , he crosses over an open manhole , and he just plummets into the sewer below .
__es__ And I picture it this way because falling is not jumping .
__es__ Falling is accidental , it &apos;s uncontrollable .
__es__ It &apos;s something that happens to us without our consent .
__es__ And this — this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship .
__es__ I am a writer and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which means I think about words for a living .
__es__ You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters , and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem .
__es__ So , in love , we fall .
__es__ We &apos;re struck .
__es__ We are crushed .
__es__ We swoon .
__es__ We burn with passion .
__es__ Love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
__es__ Our hearts ache , and then they break .
__es__ So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness .
__es__ ( Laughter ) They do .
__es__ And they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances .
__es__ My favorite one of these is &quot; &quot; smitten , &quot; &quot; which is the past participle of the word &quot; &quot; smite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dictionary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defined as both &quot; &quot; grievous affliction , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I tend to associate the word &quot; &quot; smite &quot; &quot; with a very particular context , which is the Old Testament .
__es__ In the Book of Exodus alone , there are 16 references to smiting , which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts . ( Laughter )
__es__ Right ?
__es__ So , how did this happen ?
__es__ How have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering ?
__es__ And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims ?
__es__ These are difficult questions , but I have some theories .
__es__ And to think this through , I want to focus on one metaphor in particular , which is the idea of love as madness .
__es__ When I first started researching romantic love , I found these madness metaphors everywhere .
__es__ The history of Western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness .
__es__ These are just a few examples .
__es__ William Shakespeare : &quot; Love is merely a madness , &quot; from &quot; &quot; As You Like It . &quot; &quot; Friedrich Nietzsche : &quot; There is always some madness in love . &quot;
__es__ &quot; Got me looking , got me looking so crazy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great philosopher , Beyoncé Knowles . ( Laughter )
__es__ I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
__es__ And it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows .
__es__ I can remember one moment in particular .
__es__ I was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America , and I was watching the person I love walk out the door .
__es__ And it was late , it was nearly midnight , we &apos;d gotten into an argument over dinner , and when we got back to our room , he threw his things in the bag and stormed out .
__es__ While I can no longer remember what that argument was about , I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave .
__es__ I was 22 , it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
__es__ I had another week until my flight home , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around .
__es__ I had no guidebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
__es__ Someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just froze .
__es__ I just sat there .
__es__ And then I burst into tears .
__es__ But despite my panic , some small voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
__es__ I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love .
__es__ And it sounds so strange to me now , but at 22 , I longed to have dramatic experiences , and in that moment , I was irrational and furious and devastated , and weirdly enough , I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me .
__es__ I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how loved worked .
__es__ This really should not be surprising , considering that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two albums and one novel with the title &quot; &quot; Crazy Love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he came back to our room .
__es__ We made up .
__es__ We spent another mostly happy week traveling together .
__es__ And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terrible and so great .
__es__ This must be a real romance . &quot; &quot; I expected my first love to feel like madness , and of course , it met that expectation very well .
__es__ But loving someone like that — as if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
__es__ But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
__es__ Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love .
__es__ In fact , there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal , because , neurochemically speaking , romantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished .
__es__ This is true .
__es__ This study from 1999 used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Yes , and low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression .
__es__ So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors .
__es__ And there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way .
__es__ Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
__es__ And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
__es__ But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usually from a few months to a couple of years .
__es__ When I got back from my trip to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , checking my email , desperate to hear from the guy I loved .
__es__ I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction , then I did not need their friendship .
__es__ So I stopped hanging out with most of them .
__es__ And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life .
__es__ But I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable , because if I could be miserable , then I would prove how much I loved him .
__es__ And if I could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
__es__ Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
__es__ Our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a breakup , that neurochemical reward is withdrawn .
__es__ And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neurochemically speaking , going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal , which I find reassuring .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love .
__es__ In this case , we &apos;re talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness .
__es__ It &apos;s kind of an interesting feedback loop .
__es__ Love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
__es__ What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy .
__es__ It seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like madness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
__es__ That sounds terrible .
__es__ ( Laughter ) To reconcile this , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
__es__ So , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
__es__ If we were more assertive , more open-minded , more generous and instead of falling in love , we stepped into love .
__es__ I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
__es__ They argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a guide for future actions , like self-fulfilling prophecies .
__es__ Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collaborative work of art .
__es__ I really like this way of thinking about love .
__es__ Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments , which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of , or ideas contained within , a given metaphor .
__es__ And Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails : effort , compromise , patience , shared goals .
__es__ These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long-term romantic commitment , but they also work well for other kinds of relationships — short-term , casual , polyamorous , non-monogamous , asexual — because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone .
__es__ So if love is a collaborative work of art , then love is an aesthetic experience .
__es__ Love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustrating and emotionally demanding .
__es__ And love involves both joy and pain .
__es__ Ultimately , each experience of love is different .
__es__ When I was younger , it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accept whatever love offered .
__es__ When 14-year-old Juliet first meets — or , when 14-year-old Juliet cannot be with Romeo , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disappointed or angsty .
__es__ Where is she ?
__es__ She wants to die .
__es__ Right ?
__es__ And just as a refresher , at this point in the play , act three of five , Romeo is not dead .
__es__ He &apos;s alive , he &apos;s healthy , he &apos;s just been banished from the city .
__es__ I understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Juliet &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
__es__ Reframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent , is empowering .
__es__ It &apos;s still hard .
__es__ Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together .
__es__ This isn &apos;t easy , either .
__es__ But it &apos;s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like madness .
__es__ This version of love is not about winning or losing someone &apos;s affection .
__es__ Instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
__es__ This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
__es__ This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good collaborators . Maybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;
__es__ Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shorter than I had planned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself .
__es__ This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m really glad to be here .
__es__ I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , because that would be a little weird .
__es__ I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
__es__ And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
__es__ Or here .
__es__ But here .
__es__ I mean Earth .
__es__ And by &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean those of us in this auditorium , but life , all life on Earth — ( Laughter ) from complex to single-celled , from mold to mushrooms to flying bears . ( Laughter )
__es__ Is Earth special ?
__es__ This is a question I &apos;ve wanted to know the answer to since I was a small child , and I suspect 80 percent of this auditorium has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer .
__es__ To understand whether there are any planets — out there in our solar system or beyond — that can support life , the first step is to understand what life here requires .
__es__ It turns out , of all of those 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
__es__ On one side , all life on Earth needs energy .
__es__ There are a number of different energy sources available on all planets .
__es__ On the other side , all life needs food or nourishment .
__es__ And this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a succulent tomato .
__es__ And not frozen water , and not water in a gaseous state , but liquid water .
__es__ And many solar system bodies don &apos;t have liquid water , and so we don &apos;t look there .
__es__ So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
__es__ Let &apos;s think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet .
__es__ You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid .
__es__ You have to be very careful with that atmosphere .
__es__ But if you have too little atmosphere and it &apos;s too thin and too cold , you end up like Mars , too cold .
__es__ Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
__es__ When Goldilocks walks into the room determines the answer that we get in the story .
__es__ And the same is true with planets .
__es__ They &apos;re not static things . They change .
__es__ They vary . They evolve .
__es__ And atmospheres do the same .
__es__ This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed , and it changed in big ways .
__es__ Where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid at the surface ?
__es__ Well , one idea is it escaped away to space .
__es__ And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres .
__es__ But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time , and Mars and Earth as well .
__es__ It &apos;s just a matter of degree and a matter of scale .
__es__ Number one , sunlight .
__es__ Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles .
__es__ Yes , I &apos;m dancing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even at my wedding . ( Laughter )
__es__ I mentioned that there were two things about the Goldilocks story that I wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about , and the second one is a little bit more subtle .
__es__ If Papa Bear &apos;s bowl is too hot , and Mama Bear &apos;s bowl is too cold , shouldn &apos;t Baby Bear &apos;s bowl be even colder if we &apos;re following the trend ?
__es__ This thing that you &apos;ve accepted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple .
__es__ And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
__es__ This has to play into habitability .
__es__ But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
__es__ Earth has one ; Venus and Mars do not .
__es__ I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets .
__es__ Atmosphere hasn &apos;t been able to escape .
__es__ Mars , on the other hand , has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field , and over billions of years , maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away to account for a transition from a habitable planet to the planet that we see today .
__es__ Other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship , enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself .
__es__ It &apos;s an idea that has to be tested , but the effect and how it works seems apparent .
__es__ But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
__es__ Well , we &apos;ve sent spacecraft to all three planets .
__es__ It &apos;s designed to measure atmospheric escape .
__es__ We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth .
__es__ Once we have that answer , why should you care ?
__es__ And financially as well , but deeply .
__es__ It will teach us about atmospheres that surround us and that are close .
__es__ Any lever will help .
__es__ In fact , based on observations that Kepler &apos;s taken and other similar observations , we now believe that , of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone , on average , every star has at least one planet .
__es__ It &apos;s a little bit like being trapped on a red spot — ( Laughter ) on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately wanting to know more about them , wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you .
__es__ In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
__es__ This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habitable , although very soon we may come to know of more .
__es__ But for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red spot .
__es__ I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
__es__ Thanks .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I love the Internet .
__es__ It &apos;s true .
__es__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__es__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__es__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__es__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__es__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__es__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__es__ So let me show you something .
__es__ This here is Brain .
__es__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__es__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__es__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__es__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__es__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__es__ All right .
__es__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__es__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__es__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__es__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__es__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__es__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__es__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__es__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__es__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__es__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__es__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
__es__ And I knocked on the door .
__es__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__es__ Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Basit .
__es__ Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
__es__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__es__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__es__ I asked them why .
__es__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__es__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__es__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__es__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__es__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__es__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__es__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__es__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__es__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__es__ For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
__es__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__es__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__es__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__es__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__es__ ( Siren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__es__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__es__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__es__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__es__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__es__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__es__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__es__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__es__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
__es__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__es__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__es__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__es__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__es__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__es__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__es__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
__es__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__es__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__es__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__es__ So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
__es__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
__es__ Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__es__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__es__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__es__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__es__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__es__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__es__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__es__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__es__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__es__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__es__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__es__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__es__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
__es__ We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
__es__ These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
__es__ They are both right now on the run .
__es__ Nobody knows where they are .
__es__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__es__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__es__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__es__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
__es__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
__es__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__es__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__es__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__es__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__es__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__es__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__es__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__es__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__es__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__es__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__es__ How do you actually track them down ?
__es__ Let me give you an example .
__es__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__es__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__es__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__es__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__es__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
__es__ It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
__es__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__es__ And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
__es__ Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
__es__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__es__ But just keep staring at it .
__es__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__es__ And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
__es__ But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
__es__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__es__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__es__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__es__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__es__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__es__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__es__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
__es__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
__es__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__es__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__es__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__es__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__es__ And he drives a very nice car .
__es__ In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__es__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
__es__ How do I know about this car ?
__es__ Because he blogged about the car .
__es__ He actually had a car accident .
__es__ In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__es__ And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
__es__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
__es__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
__es__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__es__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__es__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__es__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__es__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__es__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__es__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__es__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__es__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__es__ That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__es__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__es__ This is what runs everything around us .
__es__ PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__es__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__es__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__es__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__es__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__es__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__es__ Everything is being run by computers .
__es__ Everything is reliant on these computers working .
__es__ We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__es__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__es__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__es__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__es__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__es__ Think about all the services we have online .
__es__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__es__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__es__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__es__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__es__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__es__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__es__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
__es__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__es__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__es__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__es__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__es__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__es__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__es__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__es__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__es__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__es__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__es__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__es__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__es__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__es__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__es__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__es__ This is an illusion .
__es__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__es__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__es__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__es__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__es__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__es__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__es__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__es__ We can &apos;t .
__es__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__es__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__es__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__es__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__es__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__es__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__es__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__es__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__es__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__es__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__es__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__es__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__es__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__es__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__es__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__es__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__es__ And what does it mean ?
__es__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__es__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__es__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__es__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__es__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__es__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__es__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__es__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__es__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__es__ One country , two systems .
__es__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__es__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__es__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__es__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__es__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__es__ What happened ?
__es__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__es__ One nation , one system .
__es__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__es__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__es__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__es__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__es__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__es__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__es__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__es__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__es__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__es__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__es__ So the question is , why ?
__es__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__es__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__es__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__es__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__es__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__es__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__es__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__es__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__es__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__es__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__es__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__es__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__es__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__es__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__es__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__es__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__es__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__es__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__es__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__es__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__es__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__es__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__es__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__es__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__es__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__es__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__es__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__es__ The state is everywhere in China .
__es__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__es__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__es__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__es__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__es__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__es__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__es__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__es__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__es__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__es__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__es__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__es__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__es__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__es__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__es__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__es__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__es__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__es__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__es__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__es__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__es__ But it &apos;s not .
__es__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__es__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__es__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__es__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__es__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__es__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__es__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__es__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__es__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__es__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__es__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__es__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__es__ And there are two consequences of this .
__es__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__es__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__es__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__es__ When did that last happen ?
__es__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__es__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__es__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__es__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__es__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__es__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__es__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__es__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__es__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__es__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__es__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__es__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__es__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__es__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__es__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__es__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__es__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__es__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__es__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__es__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__es__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__es__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__es__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__es__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__es__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__es__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__es__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__es__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__es__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__es__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__es__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__es__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__es__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__es__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__es__ By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__es__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__es__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__es__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__es__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__es__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__es__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__es__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__es__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__es__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__es__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__es__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__es__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__es__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__es__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__es__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__es__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__es__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__es__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__es__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__es__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__es__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__es__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__es__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__es__ Last .
__es__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
__es__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__es__ And these are facts , guys .
__es__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
__es__ It &apos;s not .
__es__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__es__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__es__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__es__ We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__es__ How did this happen ?
__es__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__es__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
__es__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__es__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__es__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__es__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__es__ We don &apos;t value play .
__es__ In fact , we devalue play .
__es__ And we devalue it in three areas .
__es__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__es__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__es__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__es__ And instead , what do we value ?
__es__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__es__ To be serious .
__es__ To be really , really serious .
__es__ It did .
__es__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__es__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__es__ Heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
__es__ I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__es__ We have a serious meme running through .
__es__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__es__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__es__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__es__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . Iskam baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woohoo !
__es__ But then what happens in step three ?
__es__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
__es__ I &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
__es__ But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__es__ So what happens ?
__es__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__es__ What happens then ?
__es__ It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__es__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__es__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__es__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__es__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__es__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
__es__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__es__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__es__ We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
__es__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__es__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__es__ What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
__es__ Autocratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__es__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__es__ Untrusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__es__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.M.
__es__ That &apos;s somehow unprofessional and bad .
__es__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s unfulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__es__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__es__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__es__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__es__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__es__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__es__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__es__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__es__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__es__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__es__ And you know what ?
__es__ Evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that aren &apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__es__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__es__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . Ants play .
__es__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__es__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__es__ Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__es__ Kittens play . We all know kittens play .
__es__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__es__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__es__ Bears play .
__es__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__es__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__es__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__es__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__es__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__es__ Dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__es__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__es__ Yours truly : humans .
__es__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__es__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__es__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__es__ Really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__es__ And who are the biggest neotenists ?
__es__ Humans . We play sports .
__es__ We do it for fun , or as Olympians , or as professionals .
__es__ We play musical instruments .
__es__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
__es__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__es__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__es__ It is a huge benefit .
__es__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__es__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__es__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__es__ As a result , what happens ?
__es__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__es__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__es__ These guys are facts .
__es__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__es__ These are the benefits to play .
__es__ It is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__es__ And if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
__es__ We hold ourselves back .
__es__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__es__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__es__ What does this world look like ?
__es__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__es__ It &apos;s pretty glum .
__es__ Now imagine your workplace .
__es__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__es__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__es__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__es__ Or is it crap ? Is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
__es__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__es__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__es__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__es__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__es__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__es__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__es__ In fact , play improves our work .
__es__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__es__ For example , it stimulates creativity .
__es__ It increases our openness to change .
__es__ It improves our ability to learn .
__es__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__es__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__es__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__es__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
__es__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__es__ Our thinking is backwards .
__es__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__es__ We should be celebrating play .
__es__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__es__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__es__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__es__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__es__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__es__ And what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
__es__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__es__ People , service , profit .
__es__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__es__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__es__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__es__ One , play is universal .
__es__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__es__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sciant .
__es__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__es__ Not one customer would refer us .
__es__ I asked them all .
__es__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__es__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__es__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
__es__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__es__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__es__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__es__ Basically promoting fun .
__es__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__es__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
__es__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__es__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__es__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__es__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__es__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__es__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__es__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__es__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__es__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__es__ Rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__es__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__es__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__es__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__es__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__es__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__es__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__es__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__es__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__es__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__es__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__es__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__es__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__es__ Let them be on the Internet .
__es__ Let them be on instant messengers .
__es__ Let them take long lunches .
__es__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__es__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__es__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__es__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__es__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__es__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__es__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__es__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__es__ of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__es__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__es__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__es__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__es__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__es__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__es__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__es__ So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
__es__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__es__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__es__ Even the BBC and The New York Times .
__es__ So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__es__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__es__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__es__ And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
__es__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__es__ For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
__es__ If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
__es__ We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__es__ So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
__es__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__es__ I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
__es__ And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__es__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__es__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__es__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__es__ This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied .
__es__ We make ourselves small .
__es__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__es__ So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
__es__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__es__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__es__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__es__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__es__ So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
__es__ Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__es__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__es__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__es__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__es__ There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
__es__ So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
__es__ So it goes both ways .
__es__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__es__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__es__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__es__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
__es__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__es__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__es__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__es__ So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__es__ Probably not , right ?
__es__ So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
__es__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__es__ Here are a couple more .
__es__ So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
__es__ And here are the low-power poses .
__es__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__es__ When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
__es__ So this is what happens .
__es__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__es__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__es__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__es__ Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
__es__ So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__es__ Also , our bodies change our minds .
__es__ And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
__es__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__es__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__es__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__es__ It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
__es__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
__es__ People hate this .
__es__ We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
__es__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__es__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__es__ These kinds of things .
__es__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
__es__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__es__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__es__ I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
__es__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__es__ I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
__es__ I was thrown from the car .
__es__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__es__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__es__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__es__ I am an impostor .
__es__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__es__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__es__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__es__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__es__ So she had changed .
__es__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__es__ Fake it till you become it .
__es__ Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
__es__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__es__ Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
__es__ So , this is two minutes .
__es__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__es__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__es__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
__es__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__es__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__es__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__es__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__es__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__es__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__es__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__es__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__es__ This is a time of need .
__es__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__es__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__es__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__es__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__es__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__es__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__es__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__es__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__es__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__es__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__es__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__es__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__es__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__es__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__es__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__es__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__es__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__es__ The earth moved for both of them .
__es__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__es__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__es__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__es__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__es__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__es__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__es__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__es__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__es__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
__es__ All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
__es__ So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
__es__ Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
__es__ BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
__es__ BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
__es__ Audience : What are you reading ?
__es__ BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
__es__ I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
__es__ It literally says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
__es__ That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
__es__ It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
__es__ Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
__es__ All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ow ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
__es__ But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
__es__ And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
__es__ Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
__es__ But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
__es__ Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
__es__ They begin with a question .
__es__ The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
__es__ Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
__es__ Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
__es__ Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
__es__ Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
__es__ The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
__es__ And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
__es__ So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
__es__ And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
__es__ They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
__es__ It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
__es__ So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
__es__ It &apos;s play .
__es__ Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
__es__ Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
__es__ Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
__es__ Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
__es__ Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
__es__ It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
__es__ So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
__es__ That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
__es__ So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
__es__ And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
__es__ Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
__es__ The first step was to ask a question .
__es__ Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
__es__ So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
__es__ So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
__es__ So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
__es__ Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
__es__ She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
__es__ Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
__es__ Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
__es__ So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
__es__ Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
__es__ But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
__es__ So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
__es__ Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
__es__ Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
__es__ But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
__es__ AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
__es__ We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
__es__ They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
__es__ Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
__es__ What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
__es__ It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
__es__ It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
__es__ So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
__es__ ( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5C .
__es__ Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
__es__ Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
__es__ BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
__es__ Student : There &apos;s two up there .
__es__ And three in here .
__es__ BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
__es__ They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
__es__ And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
__es__ So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
__es__ So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
__es__ The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
__es__ Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
__es__ And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
__es__ That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
__es__ It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
__es__ So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
__es__ All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
__es__ The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
__es__ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
__es__ Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
__es__ The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
__es__ They say no .
__es__ So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
__es__ And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
__es__ What was the feedback like ?
__es__ Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
__es__ It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
__es__ It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
__es__ It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
__es__ Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
__es__ And I &apos;ll just read one .
__es__ &quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
__es__ What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
__es__ Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
__es__ Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
__es__ Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
__es__ Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
__es__ Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
__es__ Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
__es__ BL : This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
__es__ Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
__es__ You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
__es__ ( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
__es__ Audience : ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
__es__ Everyone over there shout . ( Shouts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
__es__ Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
__es__ That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
__es__ Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
__es__ So , Amy ?
__es__ AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
__es__ Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
__es__ But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
__es__ You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
__es__ Thank you.BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__es__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__es__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__es__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__es__ So get out your pen and paper .
__es__ Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__es__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__es__ There are 800 million people starving .
__es__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__es__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__es__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__es__ The lists go on and on .
__es__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__es__ There are many , many problems out there .
__es__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__es__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__es__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__es__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__es__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__es__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__es__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__es__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__es__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__es__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__es__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__es__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__es__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__es__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__es__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__es__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__es__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__es__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__es__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__es__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__es__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__es__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__es__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__es__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__es__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__es__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__es__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__es__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__es__ And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__es__ Nobody wants to do this .
__es__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__es__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__es__ And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__es__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__es__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
__es__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__es__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__es__ We have not had an idea .
__es__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__es__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__es__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__es__ It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
__es__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__es__ And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__es__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
__es__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__es__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__es__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__es__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__es__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__es__ What would be the price ?
__es__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__es__ And so on .
__es__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__es__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
__es__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__es__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__es__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__es__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__es__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__es__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
__es__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__es__ That is what economists do .
__es__ They prioritize .
__es__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__es__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__es__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__es__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__es__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__es__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__es__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__es__ These were the bad projects .
__es__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__es__ This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__es__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__es__ Why is it it came up ?
__es__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__es__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__es__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__es__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__es__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__es__ What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__es__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__es__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__es__ Yet it would do very little good .
__es__ All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
__es__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
__es__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__es__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__es__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__es__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__es__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__es__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__es__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__es__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__es__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__es__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__es__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__es__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__es__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__es__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__es__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__es__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__es__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__es__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__es__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__es__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__es__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__es__ This third best one was free trade .
__es__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
__es__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__es__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__es__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__es__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
__es__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
__es__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
__es__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__es__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__es__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__es__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__es__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__es__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__es__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__es__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__es__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__es__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__es__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__es__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__es__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__es__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__es__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__es__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__es__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__es__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__es__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__es__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__es__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__es__ And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__es__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__es__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__es__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__es__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__es__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__es__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__es__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__es__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__es__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__es__ Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__es__ Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
__es__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__es__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__es__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__es__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__es__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__es__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__es__ The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
__es__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__es__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__es__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__es__ Since then our aid has halved .
__es__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__es__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__es__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__es__ I &apos;m all for that .
__es__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__es__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__es__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__es__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__es__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__es__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__es__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__es__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__es__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__es__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__es__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__es__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__es__ There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
__es__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__es__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__es__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__es__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__es__ I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
__es__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__es__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
__es__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__es__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__es__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ The year is 1800 .
__es__ A curious little invention is being talked about .
__es__ It &apos;s called a microscope .
__es__ What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
__es__ Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
__es__ Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . This is from London .
__es__ Fast forward 200 years .
__es__ We still have this monster soup around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
__es__ Just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
__es__ Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
__es__ You take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
__es__ They all have faces .
__es__ Why is that so , that Alex in Kenya , Fatima in Bangladesh , Navjoot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
__es__ And that &apos;s primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
__es__ And remember that number : one billion .
__es__ The problem lies with the microscope itself .
__es__ Even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
__es__ Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
__es__ They are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
__es__ This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India .
__es__ Two of my students , Jim and James , traveled around India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
__es__ We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
__es__ We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
__es__ And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
__es__ What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes .
__es__ So what is a Foldscope ?
__es__ A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
__es__ So , now you think , how is that possible ?
__es__ I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
__es__ It starts with a single sheet of paper .
__es__ What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope .
__es__ So , there are three stages : There is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage .
__es__ And there are micro optics at the bottom that &apos;s actually embedded in the paper itself .
__es__ What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
__es__ This paper has no instructions and no languages .
__es__ There is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
__es__ When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an XY stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
__es__ We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
__es__ So this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
__es__ You pop this in .
__es__ There is an XY stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
__es__ So what &apos;s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
__es__ I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
__es__ And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
__es__ Another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder .
__es__ And I &apos;m going to pick one randomly .
__es__ This one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
__es__ So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
__es__ So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these setups .
__es__ So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
__es__ I have these two microscopes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
__es__ What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-axis .
__es__ You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern .
__es__ Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
__es__ Right there .
__es__ All from the simple setup that I actually described .
__es__ So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer .
__es__ So it turns out they &apos;re waterproof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
__es__ This also shows you how the projection scope works .
__es__ You get to see the beam the way it &apos;s projected and bent .
__es__ Can we get the lights back on again ?
__es__ So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
__es__ ( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy , which we call use-and-throw microscopy .
__es__ I &apos;m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
__es__ Here is a sheet of paper .
__es__ This is when we were thinking about the idea .
__es__ This is an A4 sheet of paper .
__es__ These are the three stages that you actually see .
__es__ And the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
__es__ So that &apos;s where the lenses go .
__es__ There are some light sources .
__es__ And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
__es__ So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
__es__ So here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
__es__ There it is , and it survives .
__es__ So for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
__es__ We are starting at the end of the summer .
__es__ We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscopes .
__es__ That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
__es__ We &apos;ve started collecting data for malaria , Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
__es__ And I want to leave you with this picture .
__es__ I had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
__es__ What are the tools that we &apos;re actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
__es__ I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Our world has many superheroes .
__es__ But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
__es__ For example , the catadores , workers who collect recyclable materials for a living .
__es__ Catadores emerged from social inequality , unemployment , and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the waste collection system .
__es__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__es__ Most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
__es__ They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and carroças .
__es__ And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
__es__ I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
__es__ In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças , as a new urban support for my message .
__es__ But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
__es__ By adding art and humor to the cause , it became more appealing , which helped call attention to the catadores and improve their self-esteem .
__es__ And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
__es__ So , the thing is , I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
__es__ I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide .
__es__ And then I realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to Brazil .
__es__ I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
__es__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__es__ And then , I created a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crowdfunded event .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) .
__es__ So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças .
__es__ Catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare , like physicians , dentists , podiatrists , hair stylists , massage therapists and much more .
__es__ But also , they also receive safety shirts , gloves , raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high-definition the city , while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers .
__es__ And then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , horns and mirrors .
__es__ Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
__es__ But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created Pimpx , which is inspired by TEDx , and it &apos;s a simplified , do-it-yourself , crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça .
__es__ So now everybody can join .
__es__ In two years , over 170 catadores , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors have been involved in the Pimp My Carroça movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school .
__es__ So catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
__es__ Because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__es__ So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city .
__es__ Try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
__es__ Believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
__es__ So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
__es__ Muito obrigado , thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) .
__es__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
__es__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__es__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__es__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__es__ Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__es__ So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__es__ This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades .
__es__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__es__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__es__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__es__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__es__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__es__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__es__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__es__ These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
__es__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
__es__ Everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__es__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__es__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__es__ This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__es__ So this one was taken around five .
__es__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__es__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__es__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
__es__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__es__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__es__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__es__ We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
__es__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__es__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__es__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__es__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__es__ ( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__es__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
__es__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__es__ So , these are our friends in Pike Place Market , the lab .
__es__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__es__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__es__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__es__ No , no . The other way .
__es__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__es__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__es__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__es__ OK , never mind .
__es__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__es__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__es__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__es__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__es__ One of them is to take that real ...
__es__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__es__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__es__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__es__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__es__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__es__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__es__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4G network from the market .
__es__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__es__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__es__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__es__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__es__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__es__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__es__ So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__es__ All right now , I &apos;ve overrun my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__es__ Thank you all very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
__es__ And let me start with this .
__es__ This is my baseline : This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
__es__ Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
__es__ Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
__es__ If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
__es__ Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
__es__ So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the greenish part of the picture .
__es__ Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
__es__ And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
__es__ And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
__es__ This is their baseline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
__es__ So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
__es__ And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the Line Islands , where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions .
__es__ This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
__es__ So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
__es__ Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — overgrown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
__es__ We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
__es__ We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
__es__ This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore .
__es__ Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
__es__ Fanning Island , 2,500 people .
__es__ The corals are doing better here . Lots of small fish .
__es__ This is what many divers would consider paradise .
__es__ This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
__es__ And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
__es__ If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
__es__ You can see sharks in every single dive .
__es__ And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
__es__ But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
__es__ What have we learned from these places ?
__es__ This is what we thought was natural .
__es__ This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
__es__ If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
__es__ Most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
__es__ Then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
__es__ And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
__es__ But this is a consequence .
__es__ This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
__es__ When we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
__es__ The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
__es__ The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more of everything .
__es__ The size of these boxes is bigger .
__es__ We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , more biomass of herbivores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
__es__ They clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish .
__es__ Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
__es__ These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
__es__ But still , now we have global warming .
__es__ If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
__es__ But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
__es__ So how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
__es__ Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
__es__ In Christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
__es__ In Fanning Island , the corals are not recovered .
__es__ But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
__es__ And the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
__es__ Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
__es__ And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
__es__ These places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
__es__ The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
__es__ And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
__es__ We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
__es__ So if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
__es__ Well , there are several ways .
__es__ One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
__es__ And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean .
__es__ This was my baseline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
__es__ And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
__es__ And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
__es__ But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
__es__ And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
__es__ After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
__es__ So you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
__es__ And this particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
__es__ So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
__es__ So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
__es__ These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
__es__ The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
__es__ This is very substantial .
__es__ The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
__es__ The abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
__es__ And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
__es__ In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
__es__ So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
__es__ They reproduce . That &apos;s population biology 101 .
__es__ If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
__es__ And same thing for invertebrates . This is the example .
__es__ These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
__es__ Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
__es__ One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
__es__ So these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
__es__ This is in the Bahamas : Nassau grouper .
__es__ Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
__es__ So the fishermen are catching more .
__es__ You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
__es__ So there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building resilience .
__es__ So what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
__es__ Reserves are like savings accounts .
__es__ We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
__es__ And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
__es__ Two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
__es__ This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a free-for-all .
__es__ Once the most degrading fishing gear , seine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
__es__ If you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
__es__ But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
__es__ Another example : Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef .
__es__ This is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
__es__ They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare , in one aggregation .
__es__ Fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
__es__ When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left .
__es__ And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
__es__ So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
__es__ And with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
__es__ It happened in many places around the Caribbean .
__es__ And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
__es__ Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
__es__ So how much of this do we have ?
__es__ If this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
__es__ And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
__es__ We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
__es__ Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
__es__ The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
__es__ Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
__es__ Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
__es__ Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
__es__ Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
__es__ People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
__es__ A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
__es__ So how can we do that ?
__es__ If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
__es__ And how can we reach that goal ?
__es__ Well , there are two ways of getting there .
__es__ The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago .
__es__ The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
__es__ And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
__es__ But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
__es__ Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
__es__ Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
__es__ It &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
__es__ Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
__es__ NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
__es__ So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
__es__ So the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
__es__ First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .
__es__ It &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
__es__ Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
__es__ And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
__es__ The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
__es__ We really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
__es__ And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
__es__ There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
__es__ The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
__es__ So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric .
__es__ Enric Sala : Thank you .
__es__ CA : That was a masterful job of pulling things together .
__es__ First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
__es__ How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
__es__ ES : Well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
__es__ The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
__es__ That &apos;s basically it .
__es__ The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
__es__ Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
__es__ They reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
__es__ So , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
__es__ They are like capacitors of the system .
__es__ CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
__es__ So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
__es__ ES : At least in the seas .
__es__ What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest .
__es__ And on land , this cannot work .
__es__ But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
__es__ We think this is universal .
__es__ But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
__es__ CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
__es__ You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
__es__ It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
__es__ If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
__es__ We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
__es__ ES : And then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
__es__ So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
__es__ CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
__es__ So thank you for those numbers .
__es__ The last one &apos;s a personal question .
__es__ A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
__es__ Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
__es__ ES : It is a spiritual experience .
__es__ We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
__es__ But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
__es__ And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
__es__ And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
__es__ It would be just too depressing .
__es__ CA : Well , Enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
__es__ ES : Thank you very much .
__es__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__es__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__es__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__es__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__es__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__es__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__es__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__es__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__es__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__es__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__es__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__es__ We get it in the abstract .
__es__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__es__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__es__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__es__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__es__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__es__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__es__ I think this is a problem .
__es__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__es__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__es__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__es__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__es__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__es__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__es__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__es__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__es__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__es__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__es__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__es__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__es__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__es__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__es__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__es__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__es__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__es__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__es__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__es__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__es__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__es__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__es__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__es__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__es__ I call this error blindness .
__es__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__es__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__es__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__es__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__es__ This is not mine , by the way .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__es__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__es__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__es__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__es__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__es__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__es__ Okay , so fine .
__es__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__es__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__es__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__es__ So let me tell you a story .
__es__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__es__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__es__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__es__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__es__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__es__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__es__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__es__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__es__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__es__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__es__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__es__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__es__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__es__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__es__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__es__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__es__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__es__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__es__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__es__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__es__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__es__ So this is a catastrophe .
__es__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__es__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__es__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__es__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__es__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__es__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__es__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__es__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__es__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__es__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__es__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__es__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__es__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__es__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__es__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__es__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__es__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__es__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__es__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__es__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__es__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__es__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__es__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__es__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__es__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__es__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__es__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__es__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__es__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__es__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__es__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__es__ And something else happened instead .
__es__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__es__ And something else happened instead .
__es__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__es__ And something else happened instead .
__es__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__es__ And something else happened instead .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__es__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__es__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__es__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__es__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__es__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__es__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__es__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__es__ We come up with another idea .
__es__ We tell another story .
__es__ We hold another conference .
__es__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__es__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__es__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__es__ On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
__es__ Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations headquarters .
__es__ Thankfully , those plans were foiled by an FBI informant .
__es__ Sadly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not .
__es__ Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__es__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__es__ I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
__es__ It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
__es__ My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
__es__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__es__ A few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
__es__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__es__ We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range , which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI .
__es__ That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
__es__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__es__ They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
__es__ They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
__es__ Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
__es__ These were the men I looked up to .
__es__ These were the men I called ammu , which means uncle .
__es__ By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
__es__ Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
__es__ Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bullies .
__es__ I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
__es__ So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
__es__ For those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigoted household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world .
__es__ I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
__es__ So what opened my eyes ?
__es__ One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
__es__ Through a college prep program , I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia .
__es__ My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
__es__ The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
__es__ One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish .
__es__ Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us .
__es__ I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable .
__es__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
__es__ There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
__es__ Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
__es__ As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kindest , least judgmental people I had ever met .
__es__ Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
__es__ Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
__es__ I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acquainted with being judged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
__es__ Then there was &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; On a nightly basis , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
__es__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__es__ Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
__es__ One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live .
__es__ She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hating people . &quot;
__es__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__es__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__es__ I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
__es__ So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
__es__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__es__ I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that I did not become fanaticized .
__es__ Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
__es__ I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
__es__ For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father &apos;s actions .
__es__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__es__ I am not my father .
__es__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__es__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__es__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__es__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__es__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__es__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__es__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__es__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
__es__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__es__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__es__ It &apos;s tedious .
__es__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__es__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__es__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__es__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__es__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__es__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__es__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__es__ My idea is : no ! No !
__es__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__es__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__es__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__es__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__es__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__es__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__es__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__es__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__es__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__es__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__es__ They know .
__es__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__es__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__es__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__es__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__es__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__es__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__es__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__es__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__es__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__es__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__es__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
__es__ I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
__es__ Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
__es__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__es__ This is a Klein bottle .
__es__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
__es__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__es__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
__es__ It has wonderful properties .
__es__ If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__es__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__es__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
__es__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__es__ This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__es__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__es__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__es__ That was a month of my life .
__es__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__es__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__es__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__es__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__es__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__es__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
__es__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__es__ And it sent me back .
__es__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__es__ This guy over here of course is me .
__es__ This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__es__ Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__es__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
__es__ He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__es__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__es__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__es__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__es__ In the background , my bicycle .
__es__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__es__ Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
__es__ We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__es__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__es__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
__es__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
__es__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__es__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__es__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__es__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__es__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__es__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__es__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
__es__ I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
__es__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__es__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
__es__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__es__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__es__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
__es__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__es__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__es__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__es__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
__es__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__es__ You won &apos;t need to know trig .
__es__ But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__es__ None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
__es__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__es__ ( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__es__ My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
__es__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__es__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__es__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__es__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__es__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__es__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__es__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__es__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__es__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__es__ But , probably — one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__es__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__es__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__es__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__es__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__es__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__es__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__es__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__es__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__es__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__es__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__es__ It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
__es__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__es__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__es__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__es__ The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__es__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__es__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__es__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__es__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__es__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__es__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
__es__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
__es__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__es__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
__es__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
__es__ But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__es__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__es__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__es__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
__es__ I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__es__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
__es__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__es__ I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__es__ Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
__es__ And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
__es__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__es__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__es__ He wants to clunk me over the head !
__es__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
__es__ It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
__es__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__es__ Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__es__ Chases me into this room .
__es__ The entranceway to the bell tower .
__es__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__es__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__es__ I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
__es__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__es__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__es__ I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
__es__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__es__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
__es__ A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
__es__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__es__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__es__ Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
__es__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__es__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__es__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__es__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__es__ A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
__es__ And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
__es__ In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
__es__ So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
__es__ So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it .
__es__ This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even .
__es__ It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate , it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
__es__ Or at least if bad things happen , will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe .
__es__ So I started thinking about that , but my thoughts didn &apos;t crystallize until about a month later .
__es__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-mortem .
__es__ Now , you all know what the postmortem is .
__es__ Whenever there &apos;s a disaster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
__es__ Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage .
__es__ So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem .
__es__ Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
__es__ I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
__es__ Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
__es__ Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
__es__ There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
__es__ The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged .
__es__ It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
__es__ And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels , and they could still find their nuts .
__es__ They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
__es__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__es__ So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
__es__ So in the home , designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
__es__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__es__ For your reading glasses , a particular table .
__es__ If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
__es__ What about travel ?
__es__ Now these are some rather obvious things .
__es__ Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
__es__ Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
__es__ So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
__es__ And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .
__es__ And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
__es__ And so I want to talk about that .
__es__ And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
__es__ But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , and social decision-making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts .
__es__ So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
__es__ It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
__es__ Now , what is this , the NNT ?
__es__ It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
__es__ And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that ?
__es__ The number should be one .
__es__ My doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
__es__ We haven &apos;t figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
__es__ But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
__es__ So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
__es__ This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband , independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
__es__ I ran through the numbers myself .
__es__ Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
__es__ I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
__es__ For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 .
__es__ That &apos;s right , 49 surgeries are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
__es__ And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
__es__ They include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
__es__ And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
__es__ So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
__es__ You don &apos;t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
__es__ And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
__es__ Remember , our brain under stress releases cortisol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down .
__es__ There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
__es__ So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
__es__ I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
__es__ We all are going to fail now and then .
__es__ The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
__es__ And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
__es__ So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a gradual process , and I &apos;m getting there .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Good morning !
__es__ Are you awake ?
__es__ They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
__es__ Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
__es__ Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
__es__ So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
__es__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
__es__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__es__ He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
__es__ What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
__es__ Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
__es__ How could she speak that way ?
__es__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__es__ It made me mad .
__es__ It definitely hurts !
__es__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__es__ Where could this happen ?
__es__ How did we get here ?
__es__ Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
__es__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__es__ Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
__es__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
__es__ To be one of them ?
__es__ Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
__es__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__es__ I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
__es__ The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
__es__ It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
__es__ If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
__es__ Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
__es__ So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
__es__ This is one reality .
__es__ But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
__es__ Arabic is the mother tongue .
__es__ Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
__es__ Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
__es__ How ?
__es__ Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
__es__ All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
__es__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
__es__ Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
__es__ You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
__es__ So , this is an example no one can argue with .
__es__ Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
__es__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__es__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__es__ That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
__es__ They make it sacred .
__es__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__es__ Do we know better than them ?
__es__ All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
__es__ Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
__es__ They kept it close to them .
__es__ Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
__es__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__es__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__es__ So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
__es__ If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this remind you of ?
__es__ It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
__es__ Regardless of the who , how and why .
__es__ Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__es__ Language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
__es__ So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
__es__ Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
__es__ It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
__es__ What is our intellect ?
__es__ How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
__es__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__es__ How would you feel ?
__es__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__es__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__es__ I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__es__ I asked her once how things were going .
__es__ She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; toqborni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; &quot; toqborni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
__es__ He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
__es__ It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
__es__ She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
__es__ Translate that for me .
__es__ ( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
__es__ We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
__es__ Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
__es__ Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
__es__ The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
__es__ We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
__es__ And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
__es__ We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
__es__ In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
__es__ So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
__es__ Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
__es__ After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
__es__ You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
__es__ Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
__es__ We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
__es__ If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
__es__ We &apos;d have to find an existence .
__es__ We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
__es__ This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
__es__ After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
__es__ Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
__es__ We are very cool !
__es__ And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
__es__ I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
__es__ But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
__es__ Creativity is the idea .
__es__ So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
__es__ At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
__es__ Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
__es__ Let &apos;s start from this moment .
__es__ Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
__es__ A single novel could make us global again .
__es__ It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
__es__ So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
__es__ But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
__es__ In conclusion , what can you do today ?
__es__ Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
__es__ Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
__es__ But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
__es__ ( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
__es__ You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
__es__ It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
__es__ That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
__es__ Second , there are many other things that we can do .
__es__ We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
__es__ We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
__es__ Now I will tell you a secret .
__es__ A baby first identifies its father through language .
__es__ When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci , Maman , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
__es__ ( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe . ( Applause )
__es__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__es__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__es__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__es__ I want to know how I impact them .
__es__ I want to know how they impact me .
__es__ I want to know why they fish .
__es__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__es__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__es__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__es__ So what do we call this ?
__es__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__es__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
__es__ Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
__es__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__es__ Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__es__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__es__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__es__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__es__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__es__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__es__ You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__es__ Pole caught — no bycatch .
__es__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
__es__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__es__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__es__ Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
__es__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__es__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__es__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__es__ Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
__es__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__es__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__es__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__es__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__es__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__es__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__es__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
__es__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__es__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__es__ Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant .
__es__ Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
__es__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__es__ Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__es__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__es__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__es__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
__es__ It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
__es__ Whooo !
__es__ This is an easy sell .
__es__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__es__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__es__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__es__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__es__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__es__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
__es__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__es__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__es__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__es__ So let &apos;s start there .
__es__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__es__ Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
__es__ But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
__es__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
__es__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__es__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__es__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__es__ Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__es__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood .
__es__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__es__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__es__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__es__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__es__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__es__ A couple things happened .
__es__ I made more money .
__es__ People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
__es__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__es__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__es__ They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
__es__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__es__ This is great .
__es__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__es__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
__es__ Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
__es__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__es__ This is what we need to favor .
__es__ This is what the green list says .
__es__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__es__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__es__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__es__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__es__ Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
__es__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__es__ Put it on four plates .
__es__ Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__es__ Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__es__ Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__es__ I expect a lot from food .
__es__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__es__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
__es__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__es__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__es__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__es__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__es__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__es__ I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
__es__ I get the meat sweats .
__es__ It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
__es__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__es__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__es__ Eat your vegetables .
__es__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__es__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__es__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
__es__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
__es__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
__es__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__es__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__es__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__es__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__es__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
__es__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__es__ We need to savor vegetables .
__es__ We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
__es__ And we need to save dinner .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Hi . I am an architect .
__es__ I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
__es__ 1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
__es__ It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
__es__ Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
__es__ This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
__es__ There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
__es__ As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
__es__ In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
__es__ Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
__es__ I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
__es__ So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
__es__ My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
__es__ My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
__es__ After , the building was recycled .
__es__ So that was the goal of my design .
__es__ Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
__es__ Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
__es__ So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
__es__ We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
__es__ Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
__es__ That was the problem .
__es__ Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
__es__ It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
__es__ But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
__es__ They have money and power .
__es__ Those are invisible .
__es__ So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
__es__ That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
__es__ So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
__es__ But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
__es__ For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
__es__ That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
__es__ Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
__es__ So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
__es__ We can make it better .
__es__ So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
__es__ 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
__es__ Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
__es__ Over two million people became refugees .
__es__ But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
__es__ They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
__es__ But over two million people cut trees .
__es__ It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
__es__ That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
__es__ Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
__es__ So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
__es__ We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
__es__ And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
__es__ Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
__es__ And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
__es__ So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
__es__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
__es__ After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
__es__ I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
__es__ They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
__es__ So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
__es__ I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
__es__ I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
__es__ The color coordination is very important .
__es__ And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
__es__ So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
__es__ Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
__es__ It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
__es__ Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
__es__ It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
__es__ So this building became a permanent building .
__es__ Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
__es__ Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
__es__ Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
__es__ In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
__es__ 2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
__es__ In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
__es__ And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
__es__ I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
__es__ I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
__es__ In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
__es__ It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
__es__ In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
__es__ And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
__es__ And they are very kind , affording my model .
__es__ I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
__es__ So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
__es__ Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
__es__ Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
__es__ This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
__es__ After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
__es__ But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
__es__ People suffer mentally and physically .
__es__ So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
__es__ However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
__es__ But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
__es__ They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
__es__ Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
__es__ So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
__es__ Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
__es__ He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
__es__ I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
__es__ Many of the people want to stay here forever .
__es__ I was very happy to hear that .
__es__ Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
__es__ About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
__es__ And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
__es__ So this is under construction .
__es__ And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__es__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__es__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__es__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
__es__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__es__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__es__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__es__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__es__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__es__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__es__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__es__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__es__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
__es__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__es__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__es__ What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
__es__ Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__es__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__es__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__es__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
__es__ I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
__es__ I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__es__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__es__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__es__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__es__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__es__ On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__es__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__es__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__es__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__es__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__es__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__es__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__es__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__es__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__es__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__es__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
__es__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__es__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__es__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__es__ And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
__es__ On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
__es__ And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__es__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__es__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__es__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__es__ And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__es__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__es__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
__es__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__es__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__es__ So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__es__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__es__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__es__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__es__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
__es__ Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__es__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
__es__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__es__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__es__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__es__ My son is 23 .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__es__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__es__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__es__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__es__ So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__es__ You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
__es__ And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__es__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__es__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__es__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__es__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__es__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__es__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__es__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
__es__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__es__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__es__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__es__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__es__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__es__ And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__es__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__es__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__es__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__es__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__es__ And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__es__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__es__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__es__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__es__ This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
__es__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
__es__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__es__ Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__es__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__es__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
__es__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__es__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__es__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
__es__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__es__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__es__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__es__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__es__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__es__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__es__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__es__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__es__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__es__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__es__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__es__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__es__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__es__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__es__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__es__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__es__ Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
__es__ What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
__es__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__es__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__es__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__es__ Same as the other side .
__es__ Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__es__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__es__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__es__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__es__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__es__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__es__ Oh .
__es__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__es__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__es__ Not working either .
__es__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__es__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__es__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__es__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__es__ So when you put four .
__es__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__es__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__es__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__es__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__es__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__es__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__es__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__es__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__es__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__es__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__es__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__es__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__es__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__es__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__es__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__es__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__es__ So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
__es__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__es__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__es__ So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
__es__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__es__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__es__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__es__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__es__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__es__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__es__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
__es__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__es__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__es__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
__es__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__es__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__es__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__es__ It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__es__ We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
__es__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__es__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__es__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__es__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__es__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__es__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__es__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__es__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__es__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__es__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__es__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__es__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__es__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__es__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__es__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__es__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__es__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__es__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__es__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__es__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__es__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__es__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__es__ They work in the field .
__es__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__es__ They have education programs .
__es__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__es__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__es__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__es__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__es__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__es__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__es__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__es__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__es__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__es__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__es__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__es__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__es__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__es__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__es__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__es__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__es__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__es__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__es__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__es__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__es__ This can happen .
__es__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__es__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__es__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__es__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__es__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__es__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__es__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__es__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__es__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__es__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__es__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__es__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__es__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__es__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__es__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__es__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__es__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__es__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__es__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__es__ This is the transformation that took place .
__es__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__es__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__es__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__es__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__es__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__es__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__es__ The rocket was huge .
__es__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__es__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__es__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__es__ In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__es__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__es__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__es__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__es__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__es__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__es__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__es__ All hell broke loose .
__es__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__es__ It provoked the missile gap .
__es__ It exploded an arms race .
__es__ It began the space race .
__es__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__es__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__es__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__es__ Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__es__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__es__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__es__ Support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
__es__ And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__es__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
__es__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__es__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
__es__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__es__ ( Applause ) .
__es__ Thank you , Chris .
__es__ Today , a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells And announced that I &apos;m &quot; articulate &quot; Which means that when it comes to enunciation and diction I don &apos;t even think of it ‘ Cause I ’ m &quot; &quot; articulate &quot; &quot; So when my professor asks a question And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion There ’ s no misdirected intention Pay attention ‘ Cause I ’ m “ articulate ” So when my father asks , “ Wha ’ kinda ting is dis ? ” My “ articulate ” answer never goes amiss I say “ father , this is the impending problem at hand ” And when I ’ m on the block I switch it up just because I can
__es__ So when my boy says , “ What ’ s good with you son ? ” I just say , “ I jus ’ fall out wit dem people but I done ! ” And sometimes in class I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask “ Yo ! Why dese books neva be about my peoples ” Yes , I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals Because I ’ m “ articulate ” But who controls articulation ?
__es__ Because the English language is a multifaceted oration Subject to indefinite transformation Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English But I ’ m here to tell you that even “ articulate ” Americans sound foolish to the British So when my Professor comes on the block and says , “ Hello ” I stop him and say “ Noooo … You ’ re being inarticulate … the proper way is to say ‘ what ’ s good ’ ” Now you may think that ’ s too hood , that ’ s not cool But I ’ m here to tell you that even our language has rules So when Mommy mocks me and says “ ya ’ ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store ” I say “ Mommy , no , that sentence is not following the law
__es__ Never does the word &quot; &quot; madd &quot; &quot; go before a present participle That ’ s simply the principle of this English ” If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop , From every suburbia , and every hood ‘ Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis Of this world saying “ it is good &quot; &quot; So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech But do not judge me by my language and assume That I ’ m too ignorant to teach ‘ Cause I speak three tongues One for each : Home , school and friends I ’ m a tri-lingual orator Sometimes I ’ m consistent with my language now
__es__ Then switch it up so I don ’ t bore later Sometimes I fight back two tongues While I use the other one in the classroom And when I mistakenly mix them up I feel crazy like … I ’ m cooking in the bathroom I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen But you can ’ t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken These words are spoken By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history
__es__ I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I ’ m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you ’ ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I ’ m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity So don ’ t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity As much as has been raped away from our people How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language As anything less than equal Let there be no confusion Let there be no hesitation
__es__ This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That ’ s why I put &quot; &quot; tri-lingual &quot; &quot; on my last job application I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know And when they call me for the interview I ’ ll be more than happy to show that I can say : “ What ’ s good ” “ Whatagwan ” And of course … “ Hello ” Because I ’ m “ articulate ” Thank you .

__es__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__es__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__es__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__es__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__es__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__es__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__es__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__es__ Let me show you what I mean .
__es__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__es__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__es__ All right . Very significant mark .
__es__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__es__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__es__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__es__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__es__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__es__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__es__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__es__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__es__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__es__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__es__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__es__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__es__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__es__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__es__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__es__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__es__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__es__ Wake up .
__es__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__es__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__es__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__es__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__es__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__es__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__es__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__es__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__es__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__es__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__es__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__es__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__es__ The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
__es__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__es__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__es__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
__es__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__es__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
__es__ And the third is a little bit less obvious .
__es__ Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
__es__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__es__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__es__ I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
__es__ My brothers and I dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
__es__ He was livid , and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
__es__ Later , I understood why my father got so upset .
__es__ Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
__es__ My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
__es__ His was a lonely struggle , because Bihar was also India &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
__es__ And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
__es__ And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was famished and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
__es__ Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
__es__ This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
__es__ I resolved to give back .
__es__ Later , I joined the World Bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
__es__ My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
__es__ But after we disbursed the loans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
__es__ It was Bihar all over again .
__es__ Bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
__es__ Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
__es__ And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
__es__ Second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
__es__ And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
__es__ Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
__es__ Open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__es__ The first key shift is open knowledge .
__es__ You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
__es__ They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
__es__ They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
__es__ This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades today inspiring New York City .
__es__ And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
__es__ This is the second shift : open aid .
__es__ Recently , the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
__es__ Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
__es__ Take GeoMapping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
__es__ So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
__es__ In this manner , the World Bank has now GeoMapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
__es__ This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
__es__ And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
__es__ From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
__es__ Are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
__es__ So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
__es__ But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
__es__ This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
__es__ To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
__es__ In this map from Moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
__es__ Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
__es__ So in the Philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__es__ And the government is responsive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action .
__es__ And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
__es__ In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
__es__ This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
__es__ And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
__es__ Today , even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
__es__ But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
__es__ These are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
__es__ So for instance , today , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
__es__ These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar .
__es__ Two years ago , on April 8th , 2010 , I called my father .
__es__ It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
__es__ Though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . He won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
__es__ He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
__es__ These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
__es__ Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
__es__ We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
__es__ We need to accelerate these shifts .
__es__ If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , in Uganda , and beyond .
__es__ We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
__es__ We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
__es__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__es__ So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
__es__ Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
__es__ That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
__es__ 6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
__es__ Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
__es__ It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
__es__ Washing hands with soap , a habit we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by one third .
__es__ Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , trachoma , SARS , and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap .
__es__ Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
__es__ It stops babies from dying .
__es__ Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
__es__ It can save over 600,000 children every year .
__es__ That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
__es__ I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
__es__ So now just take a minute .
__es__ I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
__es__ Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
__es__ Please shake their hands .
__es__ All right , get to know each other .
__es__ They look really pretty .
__es__ All right .
__es__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__es__ Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
__es__ Well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
__es__ And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fancy toilets , running water , and soap available , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high .
__es__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__es__ Actually , soap is available .
__es__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__es__ Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
__es__ So why is it ?
__es__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__es__ Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__es__ Well , in Mayank &apos;s family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
__es__ His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cupboard .
__es__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__es__ On average , in Mayank &apos;s family , they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap .
__es__ What &apos;s the result of that ?
__es__ Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
__es__ Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
__es__ Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
__es__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__es__ I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life .
__es__ However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
__es__ Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
__es__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__es__ Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
__es__ Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__es__ And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
__es__ Just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap .
__es__ The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
__es__ But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera .
__es__ Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment .
__es__ A hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
__es__ I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
__es__ Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
__es__ The budget is not always there .
__es__ And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
__es__ In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap .
__es__ Win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
__es__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__es__ On October 15 , we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day .
__es__ Schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world &apos;s most important public health intervention .
__es__ I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
__es__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__es__ I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
__es__ I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
__es__ We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
__es__ My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
__es__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__es__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__es__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__es__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__es__ This one is from Myanmar .
__es__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__es__ Her son , Myo , is her second one .
__es__ And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap .
__es__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__es__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
__es__ The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
__es__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__es__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__es__ The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__es__ Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
__es__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__es__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__es__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__es__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__es__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__es__ Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
__es__ Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
__es__ Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
__es__ These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
__es__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__es__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__es__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__es__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__es__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ But that can &apos;t be right .
__es__ I am for chocolate donuts .
__es__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__es__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
__es__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__es__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__es__ It &apos;s awful .
__es__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__es__ Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
__es__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__es__ So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
__es__ A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__es__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__es__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__es__ And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
__es__ This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
__es__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__es__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__es__ To give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
__es__ That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
__es__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
__es__ So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
__es__ The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
__es__ The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
__es__ So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
__es__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__es__ One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
__es__ And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
__es__ So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
__es__ So here &apos;s a video .
__es__ You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
__es__ But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
__es__ That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
__es__ The next work is Decoy .
__es__ This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
__es__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__es__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__es__ So here is the first test scenario .
__es__ You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
__es__ But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy .
__es__ It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__es__ Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
__es__ And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention , but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help .
__es__ The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
__es__ In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
__es__ So from where I &apos;m standing , each of you appears to be this big , and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision .
__es__ Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
__es__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__es__ This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
__es__ So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
__es__ It could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
__es__ It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
__es__ So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
__es__ So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
__es__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
__es__ It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
__es__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__es__ So here &apos;s a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
__es__ And here is a prototype .
__es__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
__es__ Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
__es__ This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
__es__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__es__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__es__ Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
__es__ So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
__es__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__es__ So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
__es__ So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
__es__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__es__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__es__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__es__ So in college , I was a government major , which means I had to write a lot of papers .
__es__ Now , when a normal student writes a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
__es__ So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little slowly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some heavier days later on , everything gets done , things stay civil . ( Laughter )
__es__ And I would want to do that like that .
__es__ That would be the plan .
__es__ I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
__es__ But then came my 90-page senior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
__es__ And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
__es__ It was way too big a project .
__es__ So I planned things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this .
__es__ This is how the year would go .
__es__ How hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
__es__ No big deal , right ?
__es__ But then , the funniest thing happened .
__es__ Those first few months ?
__es__ They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff .
__es__ So we had an awesome new revised plan .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
__es__ And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
__es__ And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline , still not having written a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours , pulling not one but two all-nighters — humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters — sprinted across campus , dove in slow motion , and got it in just at the deadline .
__es__ I thought that was the end of everything .
__es__ But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school .
__es__ And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
__es__ It was a very , very bad thesis . ( Laughter )
__es__ I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
__es__ No , no , it was very , very bad .
__es__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__es__ I write the blog Wait But Why .
__es__ And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
__es__ My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me , and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators , and why we are the way we are .
__es__ Now , I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people .
__es__ And to test this , I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator , so I could compare them .
__es__ I actually brought them here to show you today .
__es__ I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
__es__ I know that if you &apos;re not a trained brain expert , it &apos;s not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
__es__ So here &apos;s the brain of a non-procrastinator .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Now ...
__es__ here &apos;s my brain .
__es__ ( Laughter ) There is a difference .
__es__ Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them , but the procrastinator &apos;s brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey .
__es__ Now , what does this mean for the procrastinator ?
__es__ Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
__es__ &#91; This is a perfect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; Nope ! &#93; So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive , but the Monkey doesn &apos;t like that plan , so he actually takes the wheel , and he says , &quot; &quot; Actually , let &apos;s read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan / Tonya Harding scandal , because I just remembered that that happened .
__es__ After that , we &apos;re going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much , much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber &apos;s mom .
__es__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today .
__es__ Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Sigh ) Now , what is going on here ?
__es__ The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel .
__es__ He lives entirely in the present moment .
__es__ He has no memory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only cares about two things : easy and fun .
__es__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__es__ If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
__es__ ( Laughter ) And to the Monkey , humans are just another animal species .
__es__ You have to keep well-slept , well-fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
__es__ But , if you haven &apos;t noticed , now we &apos;re not in tribal times .
__es__ We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , and the Monkey does not know what that is .
__es__ Which is why we have another guy in our brain , the Rational Decision-Maker , who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do .
__es__ We can visualize the future .
__es__ We can see the big picture .
__es__ We can make long-term plans .
__es__ And he wants to take all of that into account .
__es__ And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
__es__ Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you &apos;re having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time .
__es__ That &apos;s why there &apos;s an overlap .
__es__ Sometimes they agree .
__es__ But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant , for the sake of the big picture .
__es__ And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
__es__ And for the procrastinator , that conflict tends to end a certain way every time , leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone , an easy and fun place that &apos;s entirely out of the Makes Sense circle .
__es__ I call it the Dark Playground .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Now , the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well .
__es__ It &apos;s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening .
__es__ The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn &apos;t actually fun , because it &apos;s completely unearned , and the air is filled with guilt , dread , anxiety , self-hatred — all of those good procrastinator feelings .
__es__ And the question is , in this situation , with the Monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
__es__ Well , turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments — someone called the Panic Monster .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Now , the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time , but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there &apos;s danger of public embarrassment , a career disaster or some other scary consequence .
__es__ And importantly , he &apos;s the only thing the Monkey is terrified of .
__es__ Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes .
__es__ It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this excitement , the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind .
__es__ He was saying , &quot; &quot; Are we clear on what we just accepted ?
__es__ Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
__es__ We need to sit down and work on this right now . &quot; &quot; And the Monkey said , &quot; &quot; Totally agree , but let &apos;s just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India , like 200 feet above the ground , and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for India . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did that day . ( Laughter )
__es__ As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
__es__ And I opened up the website , and there was my face staring right back at me .
__es__ And guess who woke up ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system &apos;s in mayhem . ( Laughter )
__es__ And the Monkey — remember , he &apos;s terrified of the Panic Monster — boom , he &apos;s up the tree !
__es__ And finally , finally , the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk .
__es__ Now , the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior , like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper , and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages .
__es__ And this entire situation , with the three characters — this is the procrastinator &apos;s system .
__es__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__es__ This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
__es__ When I did , I was amazed by the response .
__es__ Literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
__es__ These are people who were nurses , bankers , painters , engineers and lots and lots of PhD students .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And they were all writing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;
__es__ But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails .
__es__ These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
__es__ And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the procrastinator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?
__es__ Why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
__es__ Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of procrastination .
__es__ Everything I &apos;ve talked about today , the examples I &apos;ve given , they all have deadlines .
__es__ And when there &apos;s deadlines , the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved .
__es__ But there &apos;s a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline .
__es__ So if you wanted a career where you &apos;re a self-starter — something in the arts , something entrepreneurial — there &apos;s no deadlines on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get momentum , get things going .
__es__ There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don &apos;t involve any deadlines , like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health , working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn &apos;t working .
__es__ Now if the procrastinator &apos;s only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these non-deadline situations , the Panic Monster doesn &apos;t show up .
__es__ He has nothing to wake up for , so the effects of procrastination , they &apos;re not contained ; they just extend outward forever .
__es__ And it &apos;s this long-term kind of procrastination that &apos;s much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier , short-term deadline-based kind .
__es__ It &apos;s usually suffered quietly and privately .
__es__ And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness , and regrets .
__es__ And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
__es__ It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cramming for some project .
__es__ It &apos;s that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator , at times , in their own lives .
__es__ The frustration is not that they couldn &apos;t achieve their dreams ; it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t even able to start chasing them .
__es__ So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany — that I don &apos;t think non-procrastinators exist .
__es__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastinators .
__es__ Now , you might not all be a mess , like some of us , ( Laughter ) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines , but remember : the Monkey &apos;s sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren &apos;t there .
__es__ Now , I want to show you one last thing .
__es__ I call this a Life Calendar .
__es__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__es__ That &apos;s not that many boxes , especially since we &apos;ve already used a bunch of those .
__es__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__es__ We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastinating on , because everyone is procrastinating on something in life .
__es__ We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey .
__es__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__es__ And because there &apos;s not that many boxes on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today .
__es__ Well , maybe not today , but ...
__es__ ( Laughter ) You know .
__es__ Sometime soon .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ There &apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
__es__ On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
__es__ The column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
__es__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
__es__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__es__ It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck .
__es__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__es__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__es__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__es__ There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?
__es__ You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
__es__ In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
__es__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__es__ So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
__es__ And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
__es__ These better people are attracted to this concept of service .
__es__ But that &apos;s completely wrong .
__es__ What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
__es__ I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
__es__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__es__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__es__ So trust and cooperation are really important here .
__es__ The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
__es__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__es__ I can &apos;t simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
__es__ It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
__es__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__es__ If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
__es__ Nothing personal .
__es__ Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
__es__ And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
__es__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__es__ There are inherent benefits to this .
__es__ It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
__es__ If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , that means you won &apos;t watch for danger .
__es__ Bad system of survival .
__es__ The modern day is exactly the same thing .
__es__ The world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
__es__ It could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
__es__ It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
__es__ Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
__es__ It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
__es__ We have no control over these forces .
__es__ These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
__es__ The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
__es__ When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong , remarkable things happen .
__es__ I was flying on a trip , and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called , and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
__es__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__es__ So I said something .
__es__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__es__ Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
__es__ She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
__es__ she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
__es__ The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
__es__ It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
__es__ You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weakens the organization .
__es__ When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
__es__ The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
__es__ If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
__es__ We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
__es__ Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
__es__ They want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipline when necessary , build their self-confidence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
__es__ Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
__es__ We would never do it .
__es__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__es__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__es__ If you get a job at Next Jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
__es__ In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
__es__ It &apos;s the complete opposite .
__es__ This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
__es__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__es__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__es__ They have violated this deep-seated social contract .
__es__ We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
__es__ This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
__es__ Would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to Gandhi ?
__es__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
__es__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__es__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__es__ the people to save the numbers .
__es__ They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
__es__ Bob Chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
__es__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__es__ They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed layoffs .
__es__ And Bob refused .
__es__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__es__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__es__ And so they came up with a furlough program .
__es__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
__es__ They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
__es__ But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much .
__es__ He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot , and morale went up .
__es__ They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
__es__ And quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
__es__ Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
__es__ People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
__es__ Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
__es__ I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
__es__ They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
__es__ And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
__es__ This is what a leader is .
__es__ I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
__es__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__es__ We call them leaders because they go first .
__es__ We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
__es__ We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
__es__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__es__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__es__ And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
__es__ As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
__es__ I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ruth Tichauer , a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes .
__es__ That is how I grew up : encouraged to see beyond any limitation .
__es__ So part of my education included helping her in remote , indigenous communities .
__es__ I cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
__es__ During those trips , my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
__es__ Go and look behind the Mountains .
__es__ Something lost behind the mountains .
__es__ Lost and waiting for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medical student .
__es__ One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
__es__ There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
__es__ The problem starts during pregnancy .
__es__ The fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
__es__ Survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
__es__ At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
__es__ If it doesn &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
__es__ It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
__es__ But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
__es__ As you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
__es__ Video : ( Baby crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they seem desperate to breathe .
__es__ To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
__es__ One night , my friend Malte , were camping in the Amazon region .
__es__ The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
__es__ Then came a moment of inspiration .
__es__ So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
__es__ The holes in children &apos;s hearts can be closed with it .
__es__ A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
__es__ It maybe doesn &apos;t look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
__es__ In this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
__es__ The coil then closes the hole .
__es__ After that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
__es__ In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
__es__ The coil , if it works , can save lives .
__es__ I returned from Germany to Bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
__es__ With my wife and partner , Dr. Alexandra Heath , we started to see patients .
__es__ After successfully treating patients with our coil , we felt really enthusiastic .
__es__ The hole in altitude patients is different , because the orifice between the arteries is larger .
__es__ Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time , and they die .
__es__ The first coil could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bolivia .
__es__ The search started again .
__es__ We went back to the drawing board .
__es__ After many trials , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
__es__ We take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape .
__es__ It seems this time , the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn &apos;t rust because it &apos;s made of only one piece .
__es__ It can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
__es__ As you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
__es__ Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
__es__ Our device expands , places itself and closes the hole .
__es__ We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
__es__ No open surgery was necessary .
__es__ This is the child from before , after the procedure .
__es__ As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent healed .
__es__ From start to finish , the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes .
__es__ That &apos;s very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
__es__ We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us .
__es__ Together , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
__es__ We lost the fear of creating something new .
__es__ The path , it &apos;s not easy .
__es__ Many obstacles arise all the time .
__es__ But we receive strength from our patients .
__es__ Their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
__es__ Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
__es__ So we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
__es__ We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
__es__ We are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
__es__ Muchas gracias .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
__es__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
__es__ The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
__es__ So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__es__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__es__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__es__ Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
__es__ Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
__es__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
__es__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__es__ and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
__es__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__es__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__es__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
__es__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__es__ So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
__es__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__es__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__es__ So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
__es__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__es__ And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
__es__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__es__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__es__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__es__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
__es__ DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
__es__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__es__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__es__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__es__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause . )
__es__ Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
__es__ I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
__es__ There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
__es__ The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
__es__ So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
__es__ Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
__es__ It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
__es__ And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
__es__ In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
__es__ In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
__es__ In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
__es__ After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
__es__ You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
__es__ So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
__es__ And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
__es__ So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
__es__ At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
__es__ And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
__es__ Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
__es__ We call this value-based healthcare .
__es__ On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
__es__ This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
__es__ On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
__es__ When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
__es__ You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
__es__ The differences were dramatic .
__es__ Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
__es__ Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
__es__ If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
__es__ You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
__es__ If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
__es__ Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
__es__ That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
__es__ When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
__es__ But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
__es__ And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
__es__ Nobody knows .
__es__ So going the hospital is a lottery .
__es__ Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
__es__ In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
__es__ To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
__es__ They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
__es__ They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
__es__ So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
__es__ &quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
__es__ And they finally agreed .
__es__ And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
__es__ Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
__es__ They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
__es__ Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
__es__ Since then , they publish every year .
__es__ Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
__es__ And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
__es__ For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
__es__ Now I found this principle really exciting .
__es__ So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
__es__ Continuous improvement .
__es__ Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
__es__ That &apos;s exciting in itself .
__es__ But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
__es__ So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
__es__ They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
__es__ In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
__es__ So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
__es__ Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
__es__ We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
__es__ OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
__es__ The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
__es__ Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
__es__ That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
__es__ Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
__es__ This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
__es__ The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
__es__ In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
__es__ The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
__es__ Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
__es__ They were always best in class .
__es__ We were always best in class .
__es__ And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
__es__ But most of them don &apos;t know .
__es__ But physicians have another characteristic .
__es__ They actually thrive from peer recognition .
__es__ If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
__es__ They will share the information on how to improve .
__es__ So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
__es__ Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
__es__ This is happening in reality .
__es__ We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
__es__ Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
__es__ You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
__es__ It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
__es__ We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
__es__ They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
__es__ The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
__es__ That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
__es__ Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
__es__ In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
__es__ Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
__es__ Why is that ?
__es__ Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
__es__ They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
__es__ This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
__es__ The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
__es__ Can we measure it better than we do ?
__es__ We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
__es__ And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
__es__ There was an enormous energy in the room .
__es__ There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
__es__ At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
__es__ He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__es__ Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
__es__ I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
__es__ We learned a lot from those failures .
__es__ So much about a team &apos;s execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer .
__es__ The customer is the true reality .
__es__ Then I started looking at the business model .
__es__ Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
__es__ That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__es__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__es__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__es__ I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
__es__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__es__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__es__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__es__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__es__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__es__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__es__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__es__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__es__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__es__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__es__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__es__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__es__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__es__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__es__ You see that glass of water ?
__es__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__es__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__es__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__es__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__es__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__es__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__es__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__es__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__es__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__es__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__es__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__es__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__es__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__es__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__es__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__es__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__es__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__es__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__es__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__es__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__es__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__es__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__es__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__es__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__es__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__es__ The light never goes out .
__es__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__es__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__es__ Or is it photography ?
__es__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__es__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__es__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__es__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__es__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__es__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__es__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__es__ Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__es__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__es__ And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
__es__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__es__ When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
__es__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__es__ Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__es__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__es__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__es__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__es__ Is it something about the light ?
__es__ What creates the illusion ?
__es__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__es__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__es__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__es__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__es__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__es__ And let me show you a simple example .
__es__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__es__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__es__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__es__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__es__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__es__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__es__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__es__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__es__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__es__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__es__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__es__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__es__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__es__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__es__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__es__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__es__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__es__ So here &apos;s another example .
__es__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__es__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__es__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__es__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__es__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__es__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__es__ The shores are from a different location .
__es__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__es__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__es__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__es__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__es__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__es__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__es__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__es__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world .
__es__ We get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say , &quot; &quot; OK , we want an anonymous company , can you give us one ? &quot; &quot; So you actually get to see the emails , you get to see the exchanges of messages , you get to see the mechanics of how this works , how this operates .
__es__ Now , this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions .
__es__ The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned .
__es__ We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies .
__es__ There &apos;s been allegations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cellist .
__es__ And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents .
__es__ Now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel .
__es__ It seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
__es__ Why should we care about this ?
__es__ But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .
__es__ And that affects all of us .
__es__ Now , for my organization Global Witness , this exposé has been phenomenal .
__es__ We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets — something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
__es__ Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
__es__ I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll .
__es__ So you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
__es__ It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities , journalists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
__es__ I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less coverage of this issue in the United States .
__es__ And that &apos;s perhaps because some prominent US people just haven &apos;t figured in this exposé , in this scandal .
__es__ Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
__es__ It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients .
__es__ I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
__es__ In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
__es__ It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
__es__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__es__ Now , at Global Witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
__es__ How does this actually work ?
__es__ So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms .
__es__ Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
__es__ Now , what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds .
__es__ These were all preliminary meetings , and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system .
__es__ It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
__es__ This is not just about an individual lawyer who &apos;s spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
__es__ It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician who &apos;s been caught up in a scandal .
__es__ This is about how a system works , that entrenches corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
__es__ And in order to tackle this , we need to change the game .
__es__ We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder .
__es__ This may seem like doom and gloom , like there &apos;s nothing we can do about it , like nothing has ever changed , like there will always be rich and powerful individuals .
__es__ But as a natural optimist , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
__es__ This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
__es__ And since then , the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe .
__es__ One of the things that is sad is that , actually , the US is lagging behind .
__es__ There &apos;s bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate , but it isn &apos;t making as much progress as we &apos;d like to see .
__es__ So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
__es__ For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
__es__ We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
__es__ We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Secrecy like this is not good for business . &quot;
__es__ We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
__es__ Together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
__es__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__es__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__es__ Can that possibly be true ?
__es__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__es__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__es__ CA : How does it work ?
__es__ How do people release the documents ?
__es__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__es__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__es__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__es__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__es__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__es__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__es__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__es__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__es__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__es__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__es__ If we can have this document up ...
__es__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__es__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__es__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__es__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__es__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__es__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__es__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__es__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__es__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__es__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__es__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__es__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__es__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__es__ And so it came in from the outside .
__es__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__es__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__es__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__es__ JA : Yep .
__es__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__es__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__es__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__es__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__es__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__es__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__es__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__es__ Light &apos; em all up .
__es__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__es__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__es__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__es__ we need to move , time now !
__es__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__es__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__es__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__es__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__es__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__es__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__es__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__es__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__es__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__es__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__es__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__es__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__es__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__es__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__es__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__es__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__es__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__es__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__es__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__es__ I mean , did he ?
__es__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__es__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__es__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__es__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__es__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__es__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__es__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__es__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__es__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__es__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__es__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__es__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__es__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__es__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__es__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__es__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__es__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__es__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__es__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__es__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__es__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__es__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__es__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__es__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__es__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__es__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__es__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__es__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__es__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__es__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__es__ Light is good .
__es__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__es__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__es__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__es__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__es__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__es__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__es__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__es__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__es__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__es__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__es__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__es__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__es__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__es__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__es__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__es__ What is this ?
__es__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__es__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__es__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__es__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__es__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__es__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__es__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__es__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__es__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__es__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__es__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__es__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__es__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__es__ Yeah .
__es__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__es__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__es__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__es__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__es__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__es__ That &apos;s a problem .
__es__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__es__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__es__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__es__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__es__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__es__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__es__ Can that be right ?
__es__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__es__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__es__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__es__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__es__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__es__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__es__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__es__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__es__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__es__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__es__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__es__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__es__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__es__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__es__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__es__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__es__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__es__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__es__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__es__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__es__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__es__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__es__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__es__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__es__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__es__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__es__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__es__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__es__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__es__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__es__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__es__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__es__ CA : Wow .
__es__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__es__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__es__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__es__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__es__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__es__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__es__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__es__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__es__ I feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that &apos;s generally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
__es__ In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland went on a strike .
__es__ They did no work that day , whether they held professional jobs or had the work of the home .
__es__ They marched into the center of Reykjavík — 90 percent of women participated — and peacefully and in solidarity asked for equality .
__es__ Nothing worked in Iceland that day , because nothing works when women are not at work .
__es__ I will never forget this day , that President Vigdís , as we know her by her first name , stepped out on the balcony of her own home , a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won .
__es__ ( Applause ) This woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time , including boys .
__es__ She frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her after a couple of terms in office and asked , &quot; &quot; Can boys really grow up to be president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Role models really matter , but even with such strong role models who I am so grateful for , when I was encouraged to run for president , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I to run for president ?
__es__ Who am I to be president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men .
__es__ So a study done in the US in 2011 showed that 62 percent of men had considered running for office , but 45 percent of women .
__es__ That &apos;s gap of 16 percentage points , and it &apos;s the same gap that existed a decade earlier .
__es__ And it really is a shame , because I am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders and more principle-based leadership in general .
__es__ So my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit , even if I had no political experience , to step up and try to be part of creating the world that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids , and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls to be all they can be .
__es__ And it was the journey of my life .
__es__ It was amazing .
__es__ The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates .
__es__ It boiled down to nine candidates qualifying , and ultimately the race came down to four of us , three men and me .
__es__ ( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the drama yet .
__es__ You may think you have drama in the US , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can assure you we had our own drama in Iceland .
__es__ So our sitting president of 20 years announced initially that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave rise to so many candidates considering running .
__es__ Then later he changed his mind when our prime minister resigned following the infamous Panama Papers that implicated him and his family .
__es__ And there was a popular protest in Iceland , so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader .
__es__ A few days later , relations to his wife and her family &apos;s companies were also discovered in the Panama Papers , and so he withdrew from the race again .
__es__ Before doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two qualified men who he felt could fill his shoes running for office .
__es__ So on May 9 , 45 days before election day , it was not looking too good for me .
__es__ I did not even make the graph in the newspaper .
__es__ The polls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had earned .
__es__ So it would be an understatement to say that I had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table and access to television , because the network decided that they would only include those with 2.5 percent or more in the polls in the first TV debate .
__es__ I found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate that I would participate along with the three men , and I found out on live TV that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first TV debate .
__es__ ( Applause ) So , challenges .
__es__ The foremost challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with media , muscle and money .
__es__ Let &apos;s start with media .
__es__ There are those who say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
__es__ I can &apos;t say that I agree .
__es__ It proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media .
__es__ As a matter of fact , the leading candidate appeared in broadcast media 87 times in the months leading up to the elections , whereas I appeared 31 times .
__es__ And I am not saying media is doing this consciously .
__es__ When I finally got access to TV , the first question I got was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to quit ? &quot; &quot; And that was a hard one .
__es__ But of course , with 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the polls , maybe it &apos;s understandable .
__es__ But media really matters , and every time I appeared on TV , we saw and experienced a rise in the polls , so I know firsthand how much this matters and why we have to talk about it .
__es__ I was the only one out of the final four candidates that never got a front page interview .
__es__ I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates and out of coverage about the elections .
__es__ So I did face this , but I will say this to compliment the Icelandic media .
__es__ I got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit .
__es__ ( Applause ) So kudos to them .
__es__ But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
__es__ I ran as an independent candidate , not with any political party or muscle behind me .
__es__ That lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign , but it also allowed us to innovate and do politics differently .
__es__ We ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that .
__es__ It may be the reason why I had less airtime on TV , because I wanted to show other contenders respect .
__es__ When access to media proved to be so difficult , we ran our own media .
__es__ I ran live Facebook sessions where I took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot .
__es__ And we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook because we thought transparency is important if you want to establish trust .
__es__ And when reaching young voters proved to be challenging , I became a Snapchatter .
__es__ I got young people to teach me how to do that , and I used every filter on Snapchat during the last part of the campaign .
__es__ And I actually had to use a lot of humor and humility , as I was very bad at it .
__es__ But we grew the following amongst young people by doing that .
__es__ So it &apos;s possible to run a different type of campaign .
__es__ But unfortunately , one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money .
__es__ I am sad that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less financial resources than the other candidates .
__es__ This probably was partly due to the fact that I think I had a harder time asking for financial support .
__es__ And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less .
__es__ Some would call that very womanly of me .
__es__ But even with one third the media , one third the financial resources , and only an entrepreneurial team , but an amazing team , we managed to surprise everyone on election night , when the first numbers came in .
__es__ I surprised myself , as you may see in that photo .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I came in neck to neck to the leading candidate .
__es__ ( Cheers ) Well , too early , because I didn &apos;t quite pull that , but I came in second , and we went a long way from the one percent , with nearly a third of the vote , and we beat the polls by an unprecedented margin , or 10 percentage points above what the last poll came in at .
__es__ Some people call me the real winner of the election because of this , and there are many people who encouraged me to run again .
__es__ But what really makes me proud is to know that I earned proportionately higher percentage support from the young people , and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in 2040 .
__es__ ( Applause ) She is 13 , and she had never been on TV before .
__es__ And on election day , I observed her on TV repeatedly , and she was smart , she was self-confident , she was sincere , and she was supportive of her mother .
__es__ This was probably the highlight of my campaign .
__es__ ( Applause ) But there was another one .
__es__ These are preschool girls out on a walk , and they found a poster of me on a bus stop , and they saw the need to kiss it .
__es__ Audience : Aw !
__es__ This picture was really enough of a win for me .
__es__ What we see , we can be .
__es__ So screw fear and challenges .
__es__ ( Applause ) It matters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for office , be it the office of the CEO or the office of the president .
__es__ I also managed to put an impression on your very own &quot; &quot; New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I earned a new title , &quot; &quot; A living emoji of sincerity . &quot; &quot; ( Cheers ) It is possibly my proudest title yet , and the reason is that women too often get penalized for using what I call their emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that .
__es__ ( Applause ) And we need more of that .
__es__ We celebrated as if we had won on election night , because that &apos;s how we felt .
__es__ So you don &apos;t necessarily have to reach that office .
__es__ You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow beyond anything you will experience before .
__es__ So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this journey , probably more lessons than I can share here in the time we have today .
__es__ But rest assured , it was hard work .
__es__ I lost a lot of sleep during those months .
__es__ It took resilience and perseverance to not quit , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are truly , authentically listening to your own voice and working in alignment with that .
__es__ As a good sister of mine sometimes says , you may cheat on your intuition , but your intuition never cheats on you .
__es__ I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any journey you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along .
__es__ It &apos;s having people around you who share your values , your vision , but are different in every other way .
__es__ That &apos;s the formula for success for me , and I am blessed with an amazing husband , here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena , and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible .
__es__ As a matter of fact , the leading PR expert told me before I made my decision that I would do well to get seven percent .
__es__ I appreciated his perspective , because he was probably right , and he was basing it on valuable experience .
__es__ But on the one percent day , I decided here to show him that he was wrong .
__es__ It &apos;s very important to mention this , because I did lose a lot of sleep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me .
__es__ We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves .
__es__ And it &apos;s two things that I think are very important in that , in surrounding yourself with people and practices that nourish you , but it &apos;s equally important , maybe even more important , to have the courage to get rid of people and practices that take away your energy , including the wonderful bloggers and commentators .
__es__ I took a lot of support from others in doing this , and I made the decision to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s partly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this .
__es__ And when I lost my energy for a moment — and I did from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I went back to why I decided to run , and how I had decided to run my own race .
__es__ I called it a 4G campaign , the G &apos;s representing the Icelandic words .
__es__ And the first one is called &quot; &quot; Gagn . &quot; &quot; I ran to do good , to be of service , and I wanted servant leadership to be at the center of how I worked and everybody else in the campaign .
__es__ Second one is &quot; &quot; Gleði , &quot; &quot; or joy .
__es__ I decided to enjoy the journey .
__es__ There was a lot to be taken out of the journey , no matter if the destination was reached or not .
__es__ And I tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as well .
__es__ Third is &quot; &quot; Gagnsæi . &quot; &quot; I was open to any questions .
__es__ I kept no secrets , and it was all open , on Facebook and websites .
__es__ Because I think if you &apos;re choosing your president , you deserve answers to your questions .
__es__ Last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we ran on the principle of Girlpower .
__es__ ( Cheers ) I am incredibly glad that I had the courage to run , to risk failure but receive success on so many levels .
__es__ I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my entire team will agree with me , that it was worth it .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not letting you go yet . Halla Tómasdóttir : What a great crowd . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
__es__ that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to Iceland and vote for you .
__es__ But of course we probably can &apos;t vote there , but one thing we can get from Iceland and have always gotten is inspiration .
__es__ I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 1975 when all the Icelandic women walked out , and that really was a very big factor in launching the women &apos;s movement .
__es__ You made a reference to it earlier . I &apos;d love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill .
__es__ And then what you may not know because our American media did not report it , the Icelandic women walked out again on Monday . Right ?
__es__ HT : Yes , they did . PM : Can you tell us about that ?
__es__ HT : Yes , so 41 years after the original strike , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done .
__es__ So at 2 : 38pm on Monday , women in Iceland left work , because that &apos;s when they had earned their day &apos;s salary .
__es__ ( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about this is that young women and men participated in greater numbers than before , because it is time that we close the pay gap .
__es__ PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask Halla to commit right now to what she &apos;s doing next , but I will say that you &apos;d have a very large volunteer army should you decide to do that again .
__es__ Thank you Halla .
__es__ HT : Thank you all .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa .
__es__ This is a very serious problem . It &apos;s ordinarily not addressed .
__es__ So they issued an edict , in effect , that prevents women from being priests , pastors , deacons in the church , or chaplains in the military , and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary , they cannot teach if a boy is in the room , because you can find verses in the Bible , there &apos;s over 30,000 verses in the Bible , that say that a woman shouldn &apos;t teach a man , and so forth .
__es__ The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence , and that is increasing tremendously around the world .
__es__ When I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
__es__ Nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
__es__ That &apos;s a sevenfold increase .
__es__ We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country .
__es__ Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most , and I &apos;ll be fairly brief , because I have a limited amount of time , as you know .
__es__ One is genital mutilation .
__es__ Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that &apos;s a girl , very soon in her life , her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and , in a non-sterilized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman &apos;s genitalia .
__es__ And sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate .
__es__ This is not a rare thing , although it &apos;s against the law in most countries .
__es__ In Egypt , for instance , 91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way .
__es__ In some countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity .
__es__ This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries .
__es__ Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery , or human trafficking it &apos;s called nowadays .
__es__ There are 30 million people now living in slavery .
__es__ In the United States right this moment , 60,000 people are living in human bondage , or slavery .
__es__ Atlanta , Georgia , where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into slavery every month .
__es__ It &apos;s the number one place in the nation because of that .
__es__ The sex trade in Atlanta , Georgia , exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta , Georgia .
__es__ And this leads to one of the worst problems , and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world .
__es__ Sweden has got a good approach to it .
__es__ About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery , but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted , and — ( Applause ) — prostitution has gone down .
__es__ In the United States , we take just the opposite position .
__es__ For every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
__es__ Canada , Ireland , I &apos;ve already said Sweden , France , and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model .
__es__ That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
__es__ We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire : our military and our great university system .
__es__ That law needs to be changed .
__es__ They &apos;re not prosecuted .
__es__ Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
__es__ When I became president , the difference was 39 percent .
__es__ So we &apos;ve made some progress , partially because I was president and so forth — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years .
__es__ These are the kind of things that go on .
__es__ Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country .
__es__ Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth .
__es__ We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War .
__es__ Sometimes , we &apos;ve had soldiers on the ground fighting .
__es__ The other times , we &apos;ve been flying overhead dropping bombs on people .
__es__ There was four years , I won &apos;t say which ones , where we didn &apos;t — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t drop a bomb , we didn &apos;t launch a missile , we didn &apos;t fire a bullet .
__es__ But anyway , those kinds of things , the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes , are the basic causes , of abuse of women and girls .
__es__ There &apos;s one more basic cause that I need not mention , and that is that in general , men don &apos;t give a damn .
__es__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
__es__ The average man that might say , I &apos;m against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy , and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child , when separate but equal had existed .
__es__ Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against discrimination against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they enjoy a privileged position .
__es__ So what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
__es__ I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one , and where you come from , Europe and so forth , who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act , need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world .
__es__ I didn &apos;t even go down to detail about that .
__es__ But I hope that out of this conference , that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market , need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters .
__es__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__es__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__es__ I will not dance to that beating .
__es__ I know that beat .
__es__ It is lifeless .
__es__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__es__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__es__ I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
__es__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__es__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__es__ I will not kill for you .
__es__ Especially I will not die for you .
__es__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__es__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__es__ Everyone can be wrong .
__es__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__es__ I will not forget where I come from .
__es__ I will craft my own drum .
__es__ Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
__es__ Our humming will be drumming .
__es__ I will not be played .
__es__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__es__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__es__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__es__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
__es__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__es__ ( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
__es__ Confused , aspiring pacifists .
__es__ I understand .
__es__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__es__ Like a lot .
__es__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__es__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
__es__ What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__es__ Poetry does that .
__es__ It preps you . It aims you .
__es__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__es__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__es__ Hold her now with you .
__es__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__es__ Are you holding her ?
__es__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__es__ Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
__es__ But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__es__ Whose son shall it be ?
__es__ Which male child will perish a new day ?
__es__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
__es__ We cherish corpses .
__es__ We mourn women , complicated .
__es__ Bitches get beat daily .
__es__ Profits made , prophets ignored .
__es__ War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
__es__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__es__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__es__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__es__ Rhythm is half silence .
__es__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__es__ Sickness , health , tender violence .
__es__ I think now I never was pure .
__es__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am .
__es__ Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
__es__ I never was pure .
__es__ Girl spoiled before ripened .
__es__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__es__ I experience exponentially .
__es__ Everything is everything .
__es__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__es__ One woman loses six .
__es__ One woman loses her head .
__es__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__es__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__es__ One woman straps herself .
__es__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__es__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__es__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__es__ One woman never did .
__es__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__es__ Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__es__ Faced with absence .
__es__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
__es__ My spine curves spiral .
__es__ Precipice running to and running from human beings .
__es__ Cluster bombs left behind .
__es__ De facto landmines .
__es__ A smoldering grief .
__es__ Harvest contaminated tobacco .
__es__ Harvest bombs .
__es__ Harvest baby teeth .
__es__ Harvest palms , smoke .
__es__ Harvest witness , smoke .
__es__ Resolutions , smoke .
__es__ Salvation , smoke .
__es__ Redemption , smoke .
__es__ Breathe .
__es__ Do not fear what has blown up .
__es__ If you must , fear the unexploded .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__es__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__es__ Global famine was inevitable .
__es__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
__es__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__es__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__es__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__es__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__es__ Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__es__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__es__ Per-capita food production is up by a third .
__es__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__es__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__es__ How did we achieve that ?
__es__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
__es__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__es__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__es__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__es__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__es__ These are both real objects .
__es__ One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__es__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__es__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__es__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__es__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__es__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__es__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__es__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__es__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__es__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__es__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__es__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__es__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__es__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__es__ The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__es__ And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__es__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__es__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__es__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__es__ They &apos;ve come together .
__es__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__es__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__es__ In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__es__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__es__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
__es__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__es__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__es__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__es__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__es__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__es__ No other animal does it .
__es__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__es__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__es__ You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
__es__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__es__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__es__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__es__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__es__ Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__es__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__es__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__es__ Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
__es__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__es__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__es__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__es__ So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
__es__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__es__ He can make his own spears and axes .
__es__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__es__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
__es__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__es__ And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__es__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__es__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__es__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__es__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__es__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__es__ You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
__es__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__es__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__es__ And the answer is about half a second .
__es__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__es__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__es__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__es__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__es__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__es__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__es__ It was self-sufficiency .
__es__ We call that poverty these days .
__es__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__es__ How many other people ?
__es__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__es__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__es__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__es__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__es__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__es__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__es__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__es__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__es__ Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
__es__ They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
__es__ He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__es__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__es__ They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
__es__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__es__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__es__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__es__ Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__es__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__es__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__es__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__es__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__es__ The queen does it all .
__es__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__es__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__es__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__es__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__es__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__es__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__es__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__es__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__es__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__es__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__es__ The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__es__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
__es__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__es__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__es__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__es__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__es__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__es__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__es__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__es__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__es__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__es__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__es__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
__es__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__es__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__es__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__es__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__es__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__es__ They &apos;re always made from local chert .
__es__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
__es__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__es__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__es__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__es__ Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__es__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__es__ You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__es__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__es__ And that will have led to specialization .
__es__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__es__ Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
__es__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__es__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__es__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__es__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__es__ An example is Tasmania .
__es__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
__es__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__es__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
__es__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__es__ It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
__es__ The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__es__ The Tasmanians were isolated .
__es__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__es__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__es__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__es__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__es__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__es__ I mean this quite seriously .
__es__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__es__ He just knows how to run a company .
__es__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__es__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__es__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__es__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__es__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__es__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__es__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__es__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__es__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
__es__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__es__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__es__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__es__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__es__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__es__ It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__es__ However , bad things happen .
__es__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__es__ There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
__es__ Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__es__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__es__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Good afternoon .
__es__ My name is Uldus .
__es__ I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
__es__ I focus on balancing meaningful message , aesthetic , beauty , composition , some irony , and artifacts .
__es__ Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , which is named Desperate Romantics .
__es__ They &apos;re my artifacts , or paintings from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid-19th century .
__es__ I took the painting and gifted new , contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia , capturing people who are non-models but have an interesting story .
__es__ This boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at secondary school , he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality , trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality .
__es__ But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Russia .
__es__ Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
__es__ And this is Nikita , a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg .
__es__ He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting Hulk from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
__es__ Sometimes , I would compare facial features and playing with words : irony , Iron Man , ironing man .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation .
__es__ Interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
__es__ We &apos;re taught from childhood , successful marriage means successful life , so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband .
__es__ And what about me ?
__es__ I &apos;m 27 years old .
__es__ For Russian society , I &apos;m an old maid and hopeless to ever get married .
__es__ That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask , in the wedding dress , all desperate in my garden .
__es__ But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stereotypes .
__es__ Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
__es__ Be funny and create some magic .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ My name is Amit .
__es__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__es__ And it took 18 months .
__es__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__es__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__es__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__es__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__es__ And I grew up in India .
__es__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__es__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__es__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__es__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__es__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__es__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__es__ You look around at all these museums here .
__es__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__es__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__es__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__es__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__es__ You move around , you have fun .
__es__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__es__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__es__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__es__ Keep going . Have fun .
__es__ Explore .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__es__ I see this plus sign .
__es__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__es__ Now this is one of the images .
__es__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__es__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__es__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__es__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__es__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__es__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__es__ You can zoom around very simply .
__es__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__es__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__es__ But then you really want to go deep .
__es__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__es__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__es__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__es__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__es__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__es__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__es__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__es__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__es__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__es__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__es__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__es__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__es__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__es__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__es__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__es__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__es__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__es__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__es__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__es__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__es__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__es__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__es__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__es__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__es__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__es__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__es__ It really comes from these artists .
__es__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__es__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__es__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__es__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__es__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__es__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
__es__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
__es__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__es__ I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
__es__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__es__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__es__ Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual .
__es__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
__es__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
__es__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
__es__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__es__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
__es__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
__es__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
__es__ Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
__es__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__es__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
__es__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__es__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__es__ It will dry up inside .
__es__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__es__ We all do .
__es__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__es__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__es__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
__es__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__es__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__es__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__es__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__es__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__es__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__es__ In my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__es__ Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__es__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__es__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__es__ My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__es__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
__es__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__es__ I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__es__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__es__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__es__ And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
__es__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__es__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__es__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__es__ My mother became a diplomat .
__es__ So from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__es__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreigner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__es__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__es__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__es__ The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
__es__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
__es__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__es__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__es__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__es__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
__es__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__es__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__es__ In my mid-twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__es__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__es__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__es__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__es__ There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
__es__ He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
__es__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
__es__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__es__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__es__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__es__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__es__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__es__ I started writing fiction in English .
__es__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__es__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__es__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__es__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__es__ When you &apos;re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__es__ As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__es__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__es__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__es__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__es__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__es__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__es__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__es__ I guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
__es__ Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__es__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__es__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__es__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__es__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__es__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__es__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__es__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__es__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
__es__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more heavily .
__es__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__es__ You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
__es__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .
__es__ Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__es__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__es__ The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__es__ When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__es__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
__es__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__es__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__es__ It was only because of our passports .
__es__ Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__es__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__es__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__es__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__es__ It comes from everywhere .
__es__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
__es__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__es__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__es__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict .
__es__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__es__ It was just a story .
__es__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
__es__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__es__ Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__es__ Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__es__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
__es__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__es__ The other , in nuances .
__es__ One draws boundaries .
__es__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__es__ Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
__es__ Fiction is flowing water .
__es__ In the Ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__es__ With each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
__es__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
__es__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__es__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__es__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
__es__ Literature has to take us beyond .
__es__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__es__ Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was — that I once was .
__es__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
__es__ When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__es__ The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
__es__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__es__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__es__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__es__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__es__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__es__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__es__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace , which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
__es__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
__es__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__es__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__es__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__es__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
__es__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__es__ When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
__es__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__es__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__es__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__es__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__es__ Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__es__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__es__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__es__ Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__es__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__es__ We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
__es__ In the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__es__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__es__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
__es__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__es__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
__es__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__es__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
__es__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__es__ Five million people use it every month .
__es__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__es__ His work is brilliant .
__es__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__es__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__es__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
__es__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__es__ This is really exciting .
__es__ According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__es__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__es__ We made this game in 2007 .
__es__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__es__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
__es__ The &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
__es__ It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Rockies .
__es__ And the job in question was sheep rancher .
__es__ My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
__es__ I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
__es__ And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
__es__ The job in question : herding sheep . Great .
__es__ We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
__es__ So , normally , I never do any research at all .
__es__ But , this is a touchy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
__es__ So I called the Humane Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
__es__ This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
__es__ And then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
__es__ Blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
__es__ &quot; Great — got it . &quot;
__es__ OK , I call the SPCA to confirm this — they confirm it .
__es__ I also call PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confirm it .
__es__ OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
__es__ So the next day I go out .
__es__ And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
__es__ Melanie is the wife of Albert .
__es__ Albert is the shepherd in question .
__es__ Melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
__es__ Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
__es__ Alright . Great .
__es__ Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
__es__ I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
__es__ Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
__es__ Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
__es__ And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
__es__ And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
__es__ In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
__es__ A second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
__es__ And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
__es__ Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
__es__ He snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what I hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
__es__ Can we roll the video ?
__es__ No I &apos;m kidding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
__es__ So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
__es__ I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
__es__ There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scripting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
__es__ We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse — we shoot what we get !
__es__ I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
__es__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
__es__ We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Humane Society ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Humane Society .
__es__ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb squeal and bleed — we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
__es__ We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
__es__ Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
__es__ Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
__es__ I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
__es__ Gets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s quivering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
__es__ And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
__es__ When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
__es__ Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
__es__ He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
__es__ And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
__es__ And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German porno , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
__es__ Albert hands me the knife .
__es__ I go in , tail comes off .
__es__ I go in , I grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
__es__ Albert instructs , &quot; &quot; Push it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
__es__ &quot; Push it further . &quot;
__es__ I do .
__es__ The testicles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; Bite &apos; em .
__es__ Just bite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
__es__ How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rockies , and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
__es__ You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jacked-up metaphor ?
__es__ I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
__es__ I went in and I took them .
__es__ I took them like this , and I yanked my face back .
__es__ And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
__es__ OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Poetics , &quot; &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
__es__ And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__es__ Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__es__ Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
__es__ Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
__es__ It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; is .
__es__ And I &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
__es__ Great .
__es__ The other word , peripeteia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know — Euripides and Sophocles — the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
__es__ That &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
__es__ And this metaphor in my head — I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
__es__ When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
__es__ I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
__es__ Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peripetia .
__es__ You know ?
__es__ It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
__es__ Neo in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
__es__ &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
__es__ These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
__es__ And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK .
__es__ Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
__es__ Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
__es__ And I talk to him .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
__es__ Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
__es__ You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
__es__ You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
__es__ I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
__es__ &quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
__es__ Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
__es__ And , after that shoot , Dirty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
__es__ And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
__es__ I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
__es__ People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
__es__ As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
__es__ And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
__es__ I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
__es__ Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God — I did it with them .
__es__ They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
__es__ And I see it over and over and over again .
__es__ So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
__es__ Follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
__es__ Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
__es__ Probably the worst advice I ever got .
__es__ ( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
__es__ I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
__es__ I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
__es__ I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
__es__ Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
__es__ He &apos;s making a great living .
__es__ You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
__es__ The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
__es__ He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
__es__ He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
__es__ And I hear that story over and over .
__es__ Matt Froind , a dairy farmer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
__es__ Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
__es__ Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
__es__ So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
__es__ I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call &quot; &quot; successories &quot; &quot; that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now .
__es__ That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
__es__ Safety — safety first ?
__es__ Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
__es__ I mean — this is heresy , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
__es__ Right ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
__es__ What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
__es__ They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
__es__ And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; &quot; Deadliest Catch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
__es__ We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
__es__ Most hazardous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
__es__ So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
__es__ Unspeakably dangerous .
__es__ I scamper down , I go into the wheelhouse and I say , with some level of incredulity , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
__es__ And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
__es__ It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
__es__ But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
__es__ My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
__es__ My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
__es__ And for the rest of that day , safety first .
__es__ I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
__es__ Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
__es__ I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
__es__ But , what it all comes down to is this .
__es__ I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
__es__ It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
__es__ It &apos;s a civil war .
__es__ It &apos;s a cold war , really .
__es__ We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
__es__ And we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
__es__ The way we portray working people on TV — it &apos;s laughable .
__es__ If there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Admit it .
__es__ You see him all the time .
__es__ That &apos;s what plumbers look like , right ?
__es__ We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
__es__ That &apos;s what TV does .
__es__ We try hard on &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
__es__ But , we &apos;ve waged this war on Madison Avenue .
__es__ I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
__es__ Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
__es__ Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
__es__ I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
__es__ And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
__es__ How many people have their Blackberries ?
__es__ We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
__es__ I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
__es__ Good grief , not to this crowd .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
__es__ And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
__es__ Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
__es__ All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
__es__ So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
__es__ Our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
__es__ They look like the stuff we walk around with .
__es__ And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
__es__ And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
__es__ And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
__es__ I got a lot wrong .
__es__ So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
__es__ Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
__es__ I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
__es__ Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
__es__ The infrastructure is a huge deal .
__es__ This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
__es__ The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
__es__ Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
__es__ The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
__es__ Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
__es__ So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
__es__ And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
__es__ They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
__es__ It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__es__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
__es__ of sleep-deprived women .
__es__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__es__ Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
__es__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__es__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__es__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__es__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__es__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
__es__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__es__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__es__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__es__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__es__ So a high I.Q.
__es__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__es__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__es__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__es__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__es__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__es__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
__es__ And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
__es__ Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
__es__ It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
__es__ And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
__es__ OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
__es__ I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
__es__ How does this happen ?
__es__ Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
__es__ One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
__es__ What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
__es__ What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
__es__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__es__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__es__ So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
__es__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__es__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__es__ If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
__es__ And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
__es__ And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
__es__ You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
__es__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__es__ I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
__es__ OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
__es__ But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
__es__ This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
__es__ She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
__es__ Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
__es__ Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
__es__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__es__ This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud .
__es__ I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Freudian view .
__es__ And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
__es__ Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
__es__ And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
__es__ And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
__es__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__es__ This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
__es__ It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Freudian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( Laughter )
__es__ He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__es__ Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there .
__es__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__es__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__es__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__es__ Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
__es__ There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
__es__ There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
__es__ You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
__es__ I talked about that earlier .
__es__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__es__ But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
__es__ Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
__es__ Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?
__es__ Which you can completely ignore .
__es__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
__es__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__es__ You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
__es__ And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
__es__ So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?
__es__ And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
__es__ So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
__es__ And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
__es__ But maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
__es__ So because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?
__es__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__es__ It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
__es__ Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
__es__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
__es__ And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
__es__ You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
__es__ You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
__es__ Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
__es__ There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
__es__ So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
__es__ It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
__es__ By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
__es__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__es__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__es__ The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
__es__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__es__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
__es__ OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
__es__ Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
__es__ And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
__es__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__es__ When an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
__es__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__es__ Believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
__es__ I &apos;ve had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
__es__ And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that .
__es__ OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
__es__ One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
__es__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__es__ These are very compelling , vivid sensations .
__es__ The patient &apos;s not delusional .
__es__ He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
__es__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__es__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__es__ It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
__es__ If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
__es__ It sounds like an oxymoron .
__es__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__es__ The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
__es__ So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
__es__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__es__ Patients become depressed .
__es__ Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
__es__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__es__ Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
__es__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__es__ Why does this happen ?
__es__ When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
__es__ And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
__es__ The brain learns , because of this Hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
__es__ And then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?
__es__ Now , how do you help these patients ?
__es__ How do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
__es__ Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
__es__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
__es__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__es__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__es__ So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
__es__ ( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
__es__ You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
__es__ He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
__es__ He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
__es__ He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__es__ It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
__es__ So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
__es__ And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
__es__ He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
__es__ That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started giggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
__es__ He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
__es__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__es__ And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__es__ And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes .
__es__ &quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
__es__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;
__es__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__es__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__es__ So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
__es__ So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
__es__ But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
__es__ So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
__es__ Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
__es__ I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
__es__ ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
__es__ It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
__es__ But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
__es__ Now , why does this happen ?
__es__ It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
__es__ It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
__es__ On the other hand , there &apos;s no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
__es__ And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
__es__ It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
__es__ And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
__es__ So , that &apos;s the bonus .
__es__ Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
__es__ Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
__es__ But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
__es__ This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
__es__ OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
__es__ This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
__es__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__es__ He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
__es__ Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ?
__es__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__es__ Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
__es__ C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
__es__ Why does this happen ?
__es__ This is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
__es__ In us , all the senses are distinct .
__es__ These people muddle up their senses .
__es__ Why does this happen ?
__es__ One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
__es__ Synesthesia runs in families , so Galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
__es__ Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
__es__ Why would that be ?
__es__ I &apos;m going to answer that question .
__es__ It &apos;s never been answered before .
__es__ OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
__es__ Well , there are many theories .
__es__ One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
__es__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__es__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
__es__ Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
__es__ ( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?
__es__ So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
__es__ So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
__es__ So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia .
__es__ Now remember — why does this happen ?
__es__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__es__ Remember I said it runs in families ?
__es__ That gives you the clue .
__es__ And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
__es__ In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
__es__ So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
__es__ So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
__es__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
__es__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
__es__ So far , so good .
__es__ Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
__es__ Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?
__es__ I mean , schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
__es__ Normal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun .
__es__ Instantly , you &apos;ve found the links .
__es__ Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
__es__ And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
__es__ OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
__es__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__es__ ( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetes , but you &apos;re in denial about it .
__es__ Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
__es__ Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
__es__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__es__ One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
__es__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__es__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__es__ Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
__es__ ( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands .
__es__ Ninety-nine percent of you .
__es__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__es__ It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
__es__ Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
__es__ It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
__es__ If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glitters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
__es__ You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
__es__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__es__ Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
__es__ And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
__es__ All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Sorry about that .
__es__ ( Laughter )
__es__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__es__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
__es__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
__es__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__es__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__es__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__es__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__es__ Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
__es__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__es__ I had to do something .
__es__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__es__ So I tried bronze casting .
__es__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__es__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__es__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
__es__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__es__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
__es__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__es__ I was mesmerized .
__es__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
__es__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__es__ Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
__es__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
__es__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__es__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__es__ Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__es__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
__es__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__es__ So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
__es__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__es__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__es__ I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
__es__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__es__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__es__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
__es__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
__es__ So we had to create one .
__es__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
__es__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__es__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
__es__ Now it had a sense of place .
__es__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__es__ As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__es__ My life was not going to be the same .
__es__ I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__es__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__es__ Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
__es__ So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__es__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__es__ Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__es__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__es__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
__es__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__es__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
__es__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__es__ Its shape was too complex now .
__es__ So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__es__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__es__ There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__es__ So we had to create it .
__es__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__es__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__es__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__es__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__es__ Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
__es__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__es__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__es__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__es__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__es__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__es__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__es__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ So when I was a kid ...
__es__ this was my team .
__es__ First place I started to look was fish markets .
__es__ So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
__es__ Many people don &apos;t know this but tuna are warm-blooded .
__es__ There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut .
__es__ The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing .
__es__ So what do we do ?
__es__ So I guess what I &apos;m saying is this is what we &apos;ve been going with .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__es__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__es__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__es__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__es__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__es__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__es__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__es__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__es__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__es__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__es__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__es__ And I felt lighter in my body .
__pt-br__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__pt-br__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__pt-br__ While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__pt-br__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__pt-br__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__pt-br__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__pt-br__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__pt-br__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__pt-br__ There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
__pt-br__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__pt-br__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__pt-br__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__pt-br__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__pt-br__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__pt-br__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__pt-br__ One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
__pt-br__ ( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
__pt-br__ Death : Adam ?
__pt-br__ AO : Yeah .
__pt-br__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
__pt-br__ AO : Who is this ?
__pt-br__ Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
__pt-br__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__pt-br__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
__pt-br__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__pt-br__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__pt-br__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__pt-br__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__pt-br__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__pt-br__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__pt-br__ One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__pt-br__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
__pt-br__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__pt-br__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__pt-br__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__pt-br__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__pt-br__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__pt-br__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__pt-br__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break .
__pt-br__ And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news .
__pt-br__ I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here &apos;s why .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employer &apos;s expense .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s not the employer &apos;s job .
__pt-br__ Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
__pt-br__ And at this point , hundreds of people have participated .
__pt-br__ Now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
__pt-br__ Different pool , same concept .
__pt-br__ This was in the fall of 2011 .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve paid for her to get her MBA at night .
__pt-br__ It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
__pt-br__ I was working at the ACLU as the organization &apos;s science advisor .
__pt-br__ So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
__pt-br__ We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York , and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet .
__pt-br__ In March 2010 , Judge Sweet issued his opinion — 152 pages — and a complete victory for our side .
__pt-br__ First , in a pivotal moment of this case , the US government switched sides .
__pt-br__ So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad &apos;s side .
__pt-br__ Sort of .
__pt-br__ Ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
__pt-br__ But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Judge Bryson , agreed with us .
__pt-br__ So now we sought review by the Supreme Court .
__pt-br__ We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
__pt-br__ Four words : Are human genes patentable ?
__pt-br__ I was clearly more nervous than he was .
__pt-br__ The argument itself was riveting .
__pt-br__ Chris argued brilliantly .
__pt-br__ Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
__pt-br__ Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad &apos;s .
__pt-br__ But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad .
__pt-br__ It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__pt-br__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__pt-br__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__pt-br__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__pt-br__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__pt-br__ Where are economic networks ?
__pt-br__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__pt-br__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__pt-br__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__pt-br__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
__pt-br__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__pt-br__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
__pt-br__ We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__pt-br__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__pt-br__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__pt-br__ And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
__pt-br__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__pt-br__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__pt-br__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__pt-br__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
__pt-br__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__pt-br__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__pt-br__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__pt-br__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__pt-br__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
__pt-br__ The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__pt-br__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__pt-br__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__pt-br__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__pt-br__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__pt-br__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__pt-br__ And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
__pt-br__ So this is how it works .
__pt-br__ This is a video prototype .
__pt-br__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__pt-br__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__pt-br__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
__pt-br__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__pt-br__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__pt-br__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__pt-br__ So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__pt-br__ So this is a very early prototype .
__pt-br__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__pt-br__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
__pt-br__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__pt-br__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__pt-br__ So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__pt-br__ On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__pt-br__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__pt-br__ Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__pt-br__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__pt-br__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__pt-br__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__pt-br__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__pt-br__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__pt-br__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__pt-br__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
__pt-br__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
__pt-br__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__pt-br__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__pt-br__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__pt-br__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__pt-br__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__pt-br__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__pt-br__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__pt-br__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__pt-br__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__pt-br__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__pt-br__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__pt-br__ So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__pt-br__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__pt-br__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__pt-br__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__pt-br__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
__pt-br__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__pt-br__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__pt-br__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ OK , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
__pt-br__ And specifically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love .
__pt-br__ Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this metaphor , falling , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t know about you , but when I conceptualize this metaphor , what I picture is straight out of a cartoon — like there &apos;s a man , he &apos;s walking down the sidewalk , without realizing it , he crosses over an open manhole , and he just plummets into the sewer below .
__pt-br__ And I picture it this way because falling is not jumping .
__pt-br__ I am a writer and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which means I think about words for a living .
__pt-br__ You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters , and I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem .
__pt-br__ So , in love , we fall .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re struck .
__pt-br__ We are crushed .
__pt-br__ We swoon .
__pt-br__ We burn with passion .
__pt-br__ Love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
__pt-br__ So our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) They do .
__pt-br__ And they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances .
__pt-br__ My favorite one of these is &quot; &quot; smitten , &quot; &quot; which is the past participle of the word &quot; &quot; smite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dictionary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defined as both &quot; &quot; grievous affliction , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I tend to associate the word &quot; &quot; smite &quot; &quot; with a very particular context , which is the Old Testament .
__pt-br__ In the Book of Exodus alone , there are 16 references to smiting , which is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God .
__pt-br__ How have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering ?
__pt-br__ And why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims ?
__pt-br__ When I first started researching romantic love , I found these madness metaphors everywhere .
__pt-br__ These are just a few examples .
__pt-br__ &quot; Got me looking , got me looking so crazy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great philosopher , Beyoncé Knowles . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
__pt-br__ And it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows .
__pt-br__ I can remember one moment in particular .
__pt-br__ I was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America , and I was watching the person I love walk out the door .
__pt-br__ While I can no longer remember what that argument was about , I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave .
__pt-br__ I was 22 , it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
__pt-br__ I had another week until my flight home , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around .
__pt-br__ I had no guidebook and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
__pt-br__ Someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just froze .
__pt-br__ I just sat there .
__pt-br__ And then I burst into tears .
__pt-br__ But despite my panic , some small voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
__pt-br__ I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love .
__pt-br__ And it sounds so strange to me now , but at 22 , I longed to have dramatic experiences , and in that moment , I was irrational and furious and devastated , and weirdly enough , I thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me .
__pt-br__ I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how loved worked .
__pt-br__ This really should not be surprising , considering that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two albums and one novel with the title &quot; &quot; Crazy Love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he came back to our room .
__pt-br__ We made up .
__pt-br__ We spent another mostly happy week traveling together .
__pt-br__ And then , when I got home , I thought , &quot; &quot; That was so terrible and so great .
__pt-br__ But loving someone like that — as if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
__pt-br__ But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
__pt-br__ Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love .
__pt-br__ This is true .
__pt-br__ This study from 1999 used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder .
__pt-br__ So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors .
__pt-br__ And there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way .
__pt-br__ Researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
__pt-br__ And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
__pt-br__ I decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction , then I did not need their friendship .
__pt-br__ So I stopped hanging out with most of them .
__pt-br__ And it was probably the most unhappy year of my life .
__pt-br__ This is the real madness , because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward , but we talk about love as if this is true .
__pt-br__ Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
__pt-br__ Our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a breakup , that neurochemical reward is withdrawn .
__pt-br__ In this case , we &apos;re talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s kind of an interesting feedback loop .
__pt-br__ Love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy .
__pt-br__ It seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like madness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
__pt-br__ That sounds terrible .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) To reconcile this , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
__pt-br__ So , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
__pt-br__ I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
__pt-br__ Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collaborative work of art .
__pt-br__ I really like this way of thinking about love .
__pt-br__ Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments , which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of , or ideas contained within , a given metaphor .
__pt-br__ These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long-term romantic commitment , but they also work well for other kinds of relationships — short-term , casual , polyamorous , non-monogamous , asexual — because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone .
__pt-br__ Love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustrating and emotionally demanding .
__pt-br__ And love involves both joy and pain .
__pt-br__ Ultimately , each experience of love is different .
__pt-br__ When I was younger , it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accept whatever love offered .
__pt-br__ Where is she ?
__pt-br__ She wants to die .
__pt-br__ I understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Juliet &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s still hard .
__pt-br__ Love still feels totally maddening and crushing some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together .
__pt-br__ This isn &apos;t easy , either .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like madness .
__pt-br__ This version of love is not about winning or losing someone &apos;s affection .
__pt-br__ Instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
__pt-br__ This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
__pt-br__ This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good collaborators . Maybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;
__pt-br__ Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shorter than I had planned , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself .
__pt-br__ This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m really glad to be here .
__pt-br__ And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
__pt-br__ Or here .
__pt-br__ But here .
__pt-br__ I mean Earth .
__pt-br__ Is Earth special ?
__pt-br__ It turns out , of all of those 8.7 million species , life only needs three things .
__pt-br__ On one side , all life on Earth needs energy .
__pt-br__ And this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a succulent tomato .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) However , all life on Earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements , and these elements can be found on any planetary body in our solar system .
__pt-br__ So that leaves the thing in the middle as the tall pole , the thing that &apos;s hardest to achieve .
__pt-br__ Not moose , but water .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Although moose would be pretty cool . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ And not frozen water , and not water in a gaseous state , but liquid water .
__pt-br__ This is what life needs to survive , all life .
__pt-br__ And many solar system bodies don &apos;t have liquid water , and so we don &apos;t look there .
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s make the problem simpler for ourselves .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s think only about liquid water on the surface of a planet .
__pt-br__ You have to be very careful with that atmosphere .
__pt-br__ You can &apos;t have too much atmosphere , too thick or too warm an atmosphere , because then you end up too hot like Venus , and you can &apos;t have liquid water .
__pt-br__ But if you have too little atmosphere and it &apos;s too thin and too cold , you end up like Mars , too cold .
__pt-br__ Number one : if Mama Bear &apos;s bowl is too cold when Goldilocks walks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too cold ?
__pt-br__ Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
__pt-br__ And the same is true with planets .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re not static things . They change .
__pt-br__ They vary . They evolve .
__pt-br__ And atmospheres do the same .
__pt-br__ So let me give you an example .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s one of my favorite pictures of Mars .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not the highest resolution image , it &apos;s not the sexiest image , it &apos;s not the most recent image , but it &apos;s an image that shows riverbeds cut into the surface of the planet ; riverbeds carved by flowing , liquid water ; riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form .
__pt-br__ This can &apos;t happen on Mars today .
__pt-br__ The atmosphere of Mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid .
__pt-br__ This one image tells you that the atmosphere of Mars changed , and it changed in big ways .
__pt-br__ And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable , because the three requirements for life were present long ago .
__pt-br__ Where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid at the surface ?
__pt-br__ Well , one idea is it escaped away to space .
__pt-br__ And this happens with all bodies with atmospheres .
__pt-br__ But Venus also has an atmosphere that escapes with time , and Mars and Earth as well .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s just a matter of degree and a matter of scale .
__pt-br__ So we &apos;d like to figure out how much escaped over time so we can explain this transition .
__pt-br__ How do atmospheres get their energy for escape ?
__pt-br__ How do particles get enough energy to escape ?
__pt-br__ There are two ways , if we &apos;re going to reduce things a little bit .
__pt-br__ Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles .
__pt-br__ Yes , I &apos;m dancing , but they — ( Laughter ) Oh my God , not even at my wedding . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ They get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming .
__pt-br__ A second way they can get energy is from the solar wind .
__pt-br__ This thing that you &apos;ve accepted your entire life , when you think about it a little bit more , may not be so simple .
__pt-br__ And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature .
__pt-br__ This has to play into habitability .
__pt-br__ But maybe there are other things we should be thinking about .
__pt-br__ Earth has one ; Venus and Mars do not .
__pt-br__ Magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds Earth .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Does this influence habitability ?
__pt-br__ Well , how might it ?
__pt-br__ I like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And yes , my colleagues who watch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the solar wind has been equated with mucus . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ Atmosphere hasn &apos;t been able to escape .
__pt-br__ Other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the sails on a ship , enabling the planet to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself .
__pt-br__ The sails may gather energy from the solar wind .
__pt-br__ The magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;ve ever experienced them , it &apos;s magnificent .
__pt-br__ We know the energy is getting in .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re trying to measure how many particles are getting out and if the magnetic field is influencing this in any way .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s designed to measure atmospheric escape .
__pt-br__ We have similar measurements from Venus and Earth .
__pt-br__ Once we have all our measurements , we can combine all these together , and we can understand how all three planets interact with their space environment , with the surroundings .
__pt-br__ Once we have that answer , why should you care ?
__pt-br__ I mean , I care deeply ...
__pt-br__ But moreover , what we learn from these planets can be applied to atmospheres everywhere , including planets that we &apos;re now observing around other stars .
__pt-br__ Any lever will help .
__pt-br__ In addition to that , estimates suggest there are somewhere between 40 billion and 100 billion of those planets that we would define as habitable in just our galaxy .
__pt-br__ We have the observations of those planets , but we just don &apos;t know which ones are habitable yet .
__pt-br__ You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet .
__pt-br__ In the end , and for now , at least , this is our red spot , right here .
__pt-br__ This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habitable , although very soon we may come to know of more .
__pt-br__ But for now , this is the only habitable planet , and this is our red spot .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
__pt-br__ Thanks .
__pt-br__ I love the Internet .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s true .
__pt-br__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__pt-br__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__pt-br__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__pt-br__ So let me show you something .
__pt-br__ This here is Brain .
__pt-br__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__pt-br__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__pt-br__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__pt-br__ All right .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__pt-br__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__pt-br__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__pt-br__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__pt-br__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__pt-br__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__pt-br__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__pt-br__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
__pt-br__ And I knocked on the door .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__pt-br__ Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Basit .
__pt-br__ Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
__pt-br__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__pt-br__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__pt-br__ I asked them why .
__pt-br__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__pt-br__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__pt-br__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__pt-br__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__pt-br__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__pt-br__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__pt-br__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__pt-br__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__pt-br__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__pt-br__ For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
__pt-br__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__pt-br__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__pt-br__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__pt-br__ ( Siren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__pt-br__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__pt-br__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__pt-br__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__pt-br__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__pt-br__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__pt-br__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__pt-br__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
__pt-br__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__pt-br__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__pt-br__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__pt-br__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__pt-br__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
__pt-br__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__pt-br__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__pt-br__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__pt-br__ So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
__pt-br__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
__pt-br__ Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__pt-br__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__pt-br__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__pt-br__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__pt-br__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__pt-br__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__pt-br__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__pt-br__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__pt-br__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__pt-br__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__pt-br__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__pt-br__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
__pt-br__ We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
__pt-br__ These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
__pt-br__ They are both right now on the run .
__pt-br__ Nobody knows where they are .
__pt-br__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__pt-br__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__pt-br__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__pt-br__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
__pt-br__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
__pt-br__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__pt-br__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__pt-br__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__pt-br__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__pt-br__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__pt-br__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__pt-br__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__pt-br__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__pt-br__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__pt-br__ How do you actually track them down ?
__pt-br__ Let me give you an example .
__pt-br__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__pt-br__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__pt-br__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__pt-br__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__pt-br__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
__pt-br__ It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
__pt-br__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__pt-br__ And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
__pt-br__ Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
__pt-br__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__pt-br__ But just keep staring at it .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
__pt-br__ But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
__pt-br__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__pt-br__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__pt-br__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__pt-br__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__pt-br__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__pt-br__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
__pt-br__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
__pt-br__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__pt-br__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__pt-br__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__pt-br__ And he drives a very nice car .
__pt-br__ In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__pt-br__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
__pt-br__ How do I know about this car ?
__pt-br__ Because he blogged about the car .
__pt-br__ He actually had a car accident .
__pt-br__ In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__pt-br__ And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
__pt-br__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
__pt-br__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
__pt-br__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__pt-br__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__pt-br__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__pt-br__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__pt-br__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__pt-br__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__pt-br__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__pt-br__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__pt-br__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__pt-br__ This is what runs everything around us .
__pt-br__ PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__pt-br__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__pt-br__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__pt-br__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__pt-br__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__pt-br__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__pt-br__ Everything is being run by computers .
__pt-br__ Everything is reliant on these computers working .
__pt-br__ We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__pt-br__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__pt-br__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__pt-br__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__pt-br__ Think about all the services we have online .
__pt-br__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__pt-br__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__pt-br__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__pt-br__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__pt-br__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
__pt-br__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__pt-br__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__pt-br__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__pt-br__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__pt-br__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__pt-br__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__pt-br__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__pt-br__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__pt-br__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__pt-br__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__pt-br__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__pt-br__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__pt-br__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__pt-br__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__pt-br__ This is an illusion .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__pt-br__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__pt-br__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__pt-br__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__pt-br__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__pt-br__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__pt-br__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__pt-br__ We can &apos;t .
__pt-br__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__pt-br__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__pt-br__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__pt-br__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__pt-br__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__pt-br__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__pt-br__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__pt-br__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__pt-br__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__pt-br__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__pt-br__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__pt-br__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__pt-br__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__pt-br__ And what does it mean ?
__pt-br__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__pt-br__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__pt-br__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__pt-br__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__pt-br__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__pt-br__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__pt-br__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__pt-br__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__pt-br__ One country , two systems .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__pt-br__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__pt-br__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__pt-br__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__pt-br__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__pt-br__ What happened ?
__pt-br__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__pt-br__ One nation , one system .
__pt-br__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__pt-br__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__pt-br__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__pt-br__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__pt-br__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__pt-br__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__pt-br__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__pt-br__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__pt-br__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__pt-br__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__pt-br__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__pt-br__ So the question is , why ?
__pt-br__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__pt-br__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__pt-br__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__pt-br__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__pt-br__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__pt-br__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__pt-br__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__pt-br__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__pt-br__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__pt-br__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__pt-br__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__pt-br__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__pt-br__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__pt-br__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__pt-br__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__pt-br__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__pt-br__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__pt-br__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__pt-br__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__pt-br__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__pt-br__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__pt-br__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__pt-br__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__pt-br__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__pt-br__ The state is everywhere in China .
__pt-br__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__pt-br__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__pt-br__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__pt-br__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__pt-br__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__pt-br__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__pt-br__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__pt-br__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__pt-br__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__pt-br__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__pt-br__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__pt-br__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__pt-br__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__pt-br__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__pt-br__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__pt-br__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__pt-br__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__pt-br__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s not .
__pt-br__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__pt-br__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__pt-br__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__pt-br__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__pt-br__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__pt-br__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__pt-br__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__pt-br__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__pt-br__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__pt-br__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__pt-br__ And there are two consequences of this .
__pt-br__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__pt-br__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__pt-br__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__pt-br__ When did that last happen ?
__pt-br__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__pt-br__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__pt-br__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__pt-br__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__pt-br__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__pt-br__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__pt-br__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__pt-br__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__pt-br__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__pt-br__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__pt-br__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__pt-br__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__pt-br__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__pt-br__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__pt-br__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__pt-br__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__pt-br__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__pt-br__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__pt-br__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__pt-br__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__pt-br__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__pt-br__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__pt-br__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__pt-br__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__pt-br__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__pt-br__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__pt-br__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__pt-br__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__pt-br__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__pt-br__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__pt-br__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__pt-br__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__pt-br__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__pt-br__ By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__pt-br__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__pt-br__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__pt-br__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__pt-br__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__pt-br__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__pt-br__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__pt-br__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__pt-br__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__pt-br__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__pt-br__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__pt-br__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__pt-br__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__pt-br__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__pt-br__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__pt-br__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__pt-br__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__pt-br__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__pt-br__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__pt-br__ Last .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__pt-br__ And these are facts , guys .
__pt-br__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__pt-br__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__pt-br__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__pt-br__ We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__pt-br__ How did this happen ?
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__pt-br__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__pt-br__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__pt-br__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__pt-br__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t value play .
__pt-br__ In fact , we devalue play .
__pt-br__ And we devalue it in three areas .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__pt-br__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__pt-br__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__pt-br__ And instead , what do we value ?
__pt-br__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__pt-br__ To be serious .
__pt-br__ To be really , really serious .
__pt-br__ It did .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__pt-br__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__pt-br__ Heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
__pt-br__ I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__pt-br__ We have a serious meme running through .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__pt-br__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . Iskam baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woohoo !
__pt-br__ But then what happens in step three ?
__pt-br__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
__pt-br__ But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__pt-br__ So what happens ?
__pt-br__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__pt-br__ What happens then ?
__pt-br__ It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__pt-br__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__pt-br__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__pt-br__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__pt-br__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
__pt-br__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__pt-br__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__pt-br__ What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
__pt-br__ Autocratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__pt-br__ Untrusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__pt-br__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.M.
__pt-br__ That &apos;s somehow unprofessional and bad .
__pt-br__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s unfulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__pt-br__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__pt-br__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__pt-br__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__pt-br__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__pt-br__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__pt-br__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__pt-br__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__pt-br__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__pt-br__ And you know what ?
__pt-br__ Evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that aren &apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__pt-br__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__pt-br__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . Ants play .
__pt-br__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__pt-br__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__pt-br__ Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__pt-br__ Kittens play . We all know kittens play .
__pt-br__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__pt-br__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__pt-br__ Bears play .
__pt-br__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__pt-br__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__pt-br__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__pt-br__ Dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__pt-br__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__pt-br__ Yours truly : humans .
__pt-br__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__pt-br__ Really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__pt-br__ And who are the biggest neotenists ?
__pt-br__ Humans . We play sports .
__pt-br__ We do it for fun , or as Olympians , or as professionals .
__pt-br__ We play musical instruments .
__pt-br__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__pt-br__ It is a huge benefit .
__pt-br__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__pt-br__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__pt-br__ As a result , what happens ?
__pt-br__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__pt-br__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__pt-br__ These guys are facts .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__pt-br__ These are the benefits to play .
__pt-br__ It is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__pt-br__ And if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
__pt-br__ We hold ourselves back .
__pt-br__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__pt-br__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__pt-br__ What does this world look like ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s pretty glum .
__pt-br__ Now imagine your workplace .
__pt-br__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__pt-br__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__pt-br__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__pt-br__ Or is it crap ? Is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
__pt-br__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__pt-br__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__pt-br__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__pt-br__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__pt-br__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__pt-br__ In fact , play improves our work .
__pt-br__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__pt-br__ For example , it stimulates creativity .
__pt-br__ It increases our openness to change .
__pt-br__ It improves our ability to learn .
__pt-br__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__pt-br__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__pt-br__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
__pt-br__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__pt-br__ Our thinking is backwards .
__pt-br__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__pt-br__ We should be celebrating play .
__pt-br__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__pt-br__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__pt-br__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__pt-br__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__pt-br__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__pt-br__ And what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
__pt-br__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__pt-br__ People , service , profit .
__pt-br__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__pt-br__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__pt-br__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__pt-br__ One , play is universal .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__pt-br__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sciant .
__pt-br__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__pt-br__ Not one customer would refer us .
__pt-br__ I asked them all .
__pt-br__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__pt-br__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__pt-br__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__pt-br__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__pt-br__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__pt-br__ Basically promoting fun .
__pt-br__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__pt-br__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
__pt-br__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__pt-br__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__pt-br__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__pt-br__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__pt-br__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__pt-br__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__pt-br__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__pt-br__ Rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__pt-br__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__pt-br__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__pt-br__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__pt-br__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__pt-br__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__pt-br__ Let them be on the Internet .
__pt-br__ Let them be on instant messengers .
__pt-br__ Let them take long lunches .
__pt-br__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__pt-br__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__pt-br__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__pt-br__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__pt-br__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__pt-br__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__pt-br__ of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__pt-br__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__pt-br__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__pt-br__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__pt-br__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__pt-br__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__pt-br__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__pt-br__ So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
__pt-br__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__pt-br__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__pt-br__ Even the BBC and The New York Times .
__pt-br__ So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__pt-br__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__pt-br__ And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
__pt-br__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__pt-br__ For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
__pt-br__ If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
__pt-br__ We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__pt-br__ So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__pt-br__ I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
__pt-br__ And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__pt-br__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__pt-br__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__pt-br__ This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied .
__pt-br__ We make ourselves small .
__pt-br__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__pt-br__ So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__pt-br__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__pt-br__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__pt-br__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__pt-br__ So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
__pt-br__ Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__pt-br__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__pt-br__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__pt-br__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
__pt-br__ So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
__pt-br__ So it goes both ways .
__pt-br__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__pt-br__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__pt-br__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__pt-br__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
__pt-br__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__pt-br__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__pt-br__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__pt-br__ So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__pt-br__ Probably not , right ?
__pt-br__ So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
__pt-br__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__pt-br__ Here are a couple more .
__pt-br__ So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
__pt-br__ And here are the low-power poses .
__pt-br__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__pt-br__ When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
__pt-br__ So this is what happens .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__pt-br__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
__pt-br__ So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__pt-br__ Also , our bodies change our minds .
__pt-br__ And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
__pt-br__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__pt-br__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
__pt-br__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
__pt-br__ People hate this .
__pt-br__ We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__pt-br__ These kinds of things .
__pt-br__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
__pt-br__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
__pt-br__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__pt-br__ I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
__pt-br__ I was thrown from the car .
__pt-br__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__pt-br__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__pt-br__ I am an impostor .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__pt-br__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__pt-br__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__pt-br__ So she had changed .
__pt-br__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__pt-br__ Fake it till you become it .
__pt-br__ Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
__pt-br__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__pt-br__ Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
__pt-br__ So , this is two minutes .
__pt-br__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__pt-br__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
__pt-br__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__pt-br__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__pt-br__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__pt-br__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__pt-br__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__pt-br__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__pt-br__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__pt-br__ This is a time of need .
__pt-br__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__pt-br__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__pt-br__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__pt-br__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__pt-br__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__pt-br__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__pt-br__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__pt-br__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__pt-br__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__pt-br__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__pt-br__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__pt-br__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__pt-br__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__pt-br__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__pt-br__ The earth moved for both of them .
__pt-br__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__pt-br__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__pt-br__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__pt-br__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__pt-br__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__pt-br__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__pt-br__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Beau Lotto : So , this game is very simple .
__pt-br__ All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
__pt-br__ Okay , one , two , three.Audience : Can you read this ?
__pt-br__ BL : Amazing . What about this one ? One , two , three.Audience : You are not reading this .
__pt-br__ BL : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portuguese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
__pt-br__ Audience : What are you reading ?
__pt-br__ BL : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
__pt-br__ I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
__pt-br__ It literally says , &quot; &quot; Wat ar ou rea in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
__pt-br__ Right ? The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
__pt-br__ All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this frog .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : Ow ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
__pt-br__ But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
__pt-br__ And perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
__pt-br__ Now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever responding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
__pt-br__ But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
__pt-br__ Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
__pt-br__ They begin with a question .
__pt-br__ The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
__pt-br__ Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolutionarily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predator , it &apos;s too late .
__pt-br__ Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
__pt-br__ Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in register with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
__pt-br__ Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
__pt-br__ The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
__pt-br__ And yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
__pt-br__ So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
__pt-br__ And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
__pt-br__ So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s play .
__pt-br__ Now play is not simply a process . Experts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
__pt-br__ Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . Uncertainty is what makes play fun .
__pt-br__ Right ? It &apos;s adaptable to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . What that means is that we play to play . Play is its own reward .
__pt-br__ Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
__pt-br__ Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
__pt-br__ So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
__pt-br__ So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
__pt-br__ And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
__pt-br__ Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
__pt-br__ The first step was to ask a question .
__pt-br__ Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
__pt-br__ So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
__pt-br__ So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bother reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
__pt-br__ So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
__pt-br__ Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
__pt-br__ She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
__pt-br__ Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
__pt-br__ Now she is the personification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
__pt-br__ So Amy , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So Amy &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , Amy .
__pt-br__ Amy O &apos;Toole : Thank you , Beau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
__pt-br__ But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
__pt-br__ So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
__pt-br__ Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
__pt-br__ Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
__pt-br__ But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) BL : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , Amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
__pt-br__ AO : The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
__pt-br__ We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
__pt-br__ They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
__pt-br__ Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
__pt-br__ What was really exciting about this project was we , and Beau , had no idea whether it would work .
__pt-br__ It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) BL : Including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . Okay ?
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Dave Strudwick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Student : 5C .
__pt-br__ Dave Strudwick : Is she still going up here ? Student : Yeah .
__pt-br__ Dave Strudwick : So you keep track of each.Student : Henry , can you help me here ?
__pt-br__ BL : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
__pt-br__ Student : There &apos;s two up there .
__pt-br__ And three in here .
__pt-br__ BL : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
__pt-br__ They do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
__pt-br__ And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
__pt-br__ So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
__pt-br__ So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
__pt-br__ The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
__pt-br__ Methods , what did you do ? Results , what was the observation ?
__pt-br__ And the discussion is , who cares ? Right ?
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by Amy and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , &quot; &quot; smiley face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of authors there .
__pt-br__ All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
__pt-br__ The first author is Blackawton Primary School , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; &quot; Blackawton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it reviewed . So I sent it to Dale Purves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deserves wide exposure . &quot;
__pt-br__ Larry Maloney , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnificent .
__pt-br__ The work would be publishable if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the editor .
__pt-br__ They say no .
__pt-br__ So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to Biology Letters .
__pt-br__ And there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Typical science , actually , right ? So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
__pt-br__ What was the feedback like ?
__pt-br__ Well , it was published two days before Christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
__pt-br__ It was the Editors &apos; Choice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s forever freely accessible by Biology Letters .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
__pt-br__ Last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by Biology Letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll just read one .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Blackawton Bees &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
__pt-br__ What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
__pt-br__ Curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
__pt-br__ Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
__pt-br__ Please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
__pt-br__ Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
__pt-br__ Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
__pt-br__ Shimon Schocken : Right , but I like myself .
__pt-br__ BL : This is the epitome of technology . Right . Okay .
__pt-br__ Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
__pt-br__ You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . All right ?
__pt-br__ ( Clapping ) ( Clapping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . One , two , three ?
__pt-br__ Audience : ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) ( Shouts ) ( Laughter ) Brilliant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
__pt-br__ Everyone over there shout . ( Shouts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
__pt-br__ Right ? We normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what science offers us . It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
__pt-br__ Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story .
__pt-br__ So , Amy ?
__pt-br__ AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
__pt-br__ Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
__pt-br__ But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
__pt-br__ You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of Beau , and the Blackawton Bee Project .
__pt-br__ Thank you.BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__pt-br__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__pt-br__ So get out your pen and paper .
__pt-br__ Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__pt-br__ There are 800 million people starving .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__pt-br__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__pt-br__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__pt-br__ The lists go on and on .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__pt-br__ There are many , many problems out there .
__pt-br__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__pt-br__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__pt-br__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__pt-br__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__pt-br__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__pt-br__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__pt-br__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__pt-br__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__pt-br__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__pt-br__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__pt-br__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__pt-br__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__pt-br__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__pt-br__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__pt-br__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__pt-br__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__pt-br__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__pt-br__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__pt-br__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__pt-br__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__pt-br__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__pt-br__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__pt-br__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__pt-br__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__pt-br__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__pt-br__ And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__pt-br__ Nobody wants to do this .
__pt-br__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__pt-br__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__pt-br__ And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__pt-br__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
__pt-br__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__pt-br__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__pt-br__ We have not had an idea .
__pt-br__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__pt-br__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__pt-br__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__pt-br__ It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
__pt-br__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__pt-br__ And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__pt-br__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
__pt-br__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__pt-br__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__pt-br__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__pt-br__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__pt-br__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__pt-br__ What would be the price ?
__pt-br__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__pt-br__ And so on .
__pt-br__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__pt-br__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
__pt-br__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__pt-br__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__pt-br__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__pt-br__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__pt-br__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__pt-br__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
__pt-br__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__pt-br__ That is what economists do .
__pt-br__ They prioritize .
__pt-br__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__pt-br__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__pt-br__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__pt-br__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__pt-br__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__pt-br__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__pt-br__ These were the bad projects .
__pt-br__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__pt-br__ This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__pt-br__ Why is it it came up ?
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__pt-br__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__pt-br__ What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__pt-br__ Yet it would do very little good .
__pt-br__ All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
__pt-br__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
__pt-br__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__pt-br__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__pt-br__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__pt-br__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__pt-br__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__pt-br__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__pt-br__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__pt-br__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__pt-br__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__pt-br__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__pt-br__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__pt-br__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__pt-br__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__pt-br__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__pt-br__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__pt-br__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__pt-br__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__pt-br__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__pt-br__ This third best one was free trade .
__pt-br__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
__pt-br__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__pt-br__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__pt-br__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__pt-br__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
__pt-br__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
__pt-br__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
__pt-br__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__pt-br__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__pt-br__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__pt-br__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__pt-br__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__pt-br__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__pt-br__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__pt-br__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__pt-br__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__pt-br__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__pt-br__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__pt-br__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__pt-br__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__pt-br__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__pt-br__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__pt-br__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__pt-br__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__pt-br__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__pt-br__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__pt-br__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__pt-br__ And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__pt-br__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__pt-br__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__pt-br__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__pt-br__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__pt-br__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__pt-br__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__pt-br__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__pt-br__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__pt-br__ Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__pt-br__ Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
__pt-br__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__pt-br__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__pt-br__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__pt-br__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__pt-br__ The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
__pt-br__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__pt-br__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__pt-br__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__pt-br__ Since then our aid has halved .
__pt-br__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__pt-br__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__pt-br__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m all for that .
__pt-br__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__pt-br__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__pt-br__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__pt-br__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__pt-br__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__pt-br__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__pt-br__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__pt-br__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__pt-br__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__pt-br__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__pt-br__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
__pt-br__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__pt-br__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__pt-br__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__pt-br__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__pt-br__ I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
__pt-br__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__pt-br__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
__pt-br__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__pt-br__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__pt-br__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ The year is 1800 .
__pt-br__ A curious little invention is being talked about .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s called a microscope .
__pt-br__ What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
__pt-br__ Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
__pt-br__ Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup , not very far from here . This is from London .
__pt-br__ Fast forward 200 years .
__pt-br__ We still have this monster soup around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
__pt-br__ Just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
__pt-br__ Now it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
__pt-br__ You take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
__pt-br__ They all have faces .
__pt-br__ Why is that so , that Alex in Kenya , Fatima in Bangladesh , Navjoot in Mumbai , and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
__pt-br__ And remember that number : one billion .
__pt-br__ The problem lies with the microscope itself .
__pt-br__ Even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
__pt-br__ Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
__pt-br__ They are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
__pt-br__ This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the &apos; 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India .
__pt-br__ Two of my students , Jim and James , traveled around India and Thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
__pt-br__ We saw all kinds of donated equipment .
__pt-br__ We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
__pt-br__ And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn &apos;t know how to even turn it on .
__pt-br__ What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes .
__pt-br__ So what is a Foldscope ?
__pt-br__ A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
__pt-br__ So , now you think , how is that possible ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
__pt-br__ It starts with a single sheet of paper .
__pt-br__ What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope .
__pt-br__ So , there are three stages : There is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage .
__pt-br__ And there are micro optics at the bottom that &apos;s actually embedded in the paper itself .
__pt-br__ What you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , I tab it off , and I break it off .
__pt-br__ This paper has no instructions and no languages .
__pt-br__ There is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
__pt-br__ When it &apos;s done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an XY stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
__pt-br__ We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
__pt-br__ So this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
__pt-br__ You pop this in .
__pt-br__ There is an XY stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that &apos;s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
__pt-br__ So what &apos;s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when I do this , but I &apos;m going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
__pt-br__ I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
__pt-br__ And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
__pt-br__ Another fun fact is , this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool , but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m going to pick one randomly .
__pt-br__ This one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
__pt-br__ So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
__pt-br__ So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these setups .
__pt-br__ So what I would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
__pt-br__ I have these two microscopes that I &apos;m going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what I would see .
__pt-br__ What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-axis .
__pt-br__ You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern .
__pt-br__ Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
__pt-br__ Right there .
__pt-br__ All from the simple setup that I actually described .
__pt-br__ So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer .
__pt-br__ So it turns out they &apos;re waterproof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
__pt-br__ This also shows you how the projection scope works .
__pt-br__ You get to see the beam the way it &apos;s projected and bent .
__pt-br__ Can we get the lights back on again ?
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture , the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy , which we call use-and-throw microscopy .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
__pt-br__ Here is a sheet of paper .
__pt-br__ This is when we were thinking about the idea .
__pt-br__ This is an A4 sheet of paper .
__pt-br__ These are the three stages that you actually see .
__pt-br__ And the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
__pt-br__ So that &apos;s where the lenses go .
__pt-br__ There are some light sources .
__pt-br__ And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
__pt-br__ So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
__pt-br__ So here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
__pt-br__ There it is , and it survives .
__pt-br__ So for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
__pt-br__ We are starting at the end of the summer .
__pt-br__ We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscopes .
__pt-br__ That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve started collecting data for malaria , Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
__pt-br__ And I want to leave you with this picture .
__pt-br__ I had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
__pt-br__ What are the tools that we &apos;re actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
__pt-br__ I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__pt-br__ They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and carroças .
__pt-br__ I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
__pt-br__ In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças , as a new urban support for my message .
__pt-br__ But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
__pt-br__ And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
__pt-br__ So , the thing is , I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
__pt-br__ I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
__pt-br__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__pt-br__ And then , I created a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crowdfunded event .
__pt-br__ But also , they also receive safety shirts , gloves , raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high-definition the city , while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers .
__pt-br__ And then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , horns and mirrors .
__pt-br__ Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
__pt-br__ Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
__pt-br__ So now everybody can join .
__pt-br__ So catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
__pt-br__ Because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) .
__pt-br__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
__pt-br__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__pt-br__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__pt-br__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__pt-br__ Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__pt-br__ So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__pt-br__ This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades .
__pt-br__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__pt-br__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__pt-br__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__pt-br__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__pt-br__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__pt-br__ These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
__pt-br__ Everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__pt-br__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__pt-br__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__pt-br__ This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__pt-br__ So this one was taken around five .
__pt-br__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__pt-br__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
__pt-br__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__pt-br__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__pt-br__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
__pt-br__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__pt-br__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__pt-br__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__pt-br__ ( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__pt-br__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__pt-br__ So , these are our friends in Pike Place Market , the lab .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__pt-br__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__pt-br__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__pt-br__ No , no . The other way .
__pt-br__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__pt-br__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__pt-br__ OK , never mind .
__pt-br__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__pt-br__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__pt-br__ One of them is to take that real ...
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__pt-br__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__pt-br__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__pt-br__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__pt-br__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4G network from the market .
__pt-br__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__pt-br__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__pt-br__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__pt-br__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__pt-br__ So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__pt-br__ All right now , I &apos;ve overrun my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__pt-br__ Thank you all very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
__pt-br__ And let me start with this .
__pt-br__ This is my baseline : This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
__pt-br__ Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the Mediterranean coast off Spain .
__pt-br__ Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
__pt-br__ If Joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
__pt-br__ Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
__pt-br__ So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the greenish part of the picture .
__pt-br__ Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial soup and jellyfish .
__pt-br__ And where the diver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae overgrowing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
__pt-br__ And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
__pt-br__ This is their baseline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
__pt-br__ And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the Line Islands , where we have conducted a series of National Geographic expeditions .
__pt-br__ This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati that spans across the equator and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
__pt-br__ Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — overgrown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them .
__pt-br__ We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
__pt-br__ We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
__pt-br__ This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777 and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s move the dial a little bit to the past .
__pt-br__ Fanning Island , 2,500 people .
__pt-br__ The corals are doing better here . Lots of small fish .
__pt-br__ This is what many divers would consider paradise .
__pt-br__ This is where you can see most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary .
__pt-br__ And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
__pt-br__ If we go back to a place like Palmyra Atoll , where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
__pt-br__ You can see sharks in every single dive .
__pt-br__ And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
__pt-br__ But then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
__pt-br__ What have we learned from these places ?
__pt-br__ This is what we thought was natural .
__pt-br__ This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
__pt-br__ If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them , this is what we would expect .
__pt-br__ Most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
__pt-br__ Then the plankton feeders , these little damselfish , the little animals floating in the water .
__pt-br__ And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores , and a lower biomass of top head , or the sharks , the large snappers , the large groupers .
__pt-br__ But this is a consequence .
__pt-br__ This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .
__pt-br__ When we went to pristine reefs , we realized that the natural world was upside down ; this pyramid was inverted .
__pt-br__ The top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like Kingman Reef , which is now protected .
__pt-br__ The good news is that , in addition to having more predators , there &apos;s more of everything .
__pt-br__ The size of these boxes is bigger .
__pt-br__ We have more sharks , more biomass of snappers , more biomass of herbivores , too , like these parrot fish that are like marine goats .
__pt-br__ They clean the reef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish .
__pt-br__ Not only do these places — these ancient , pristine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams ; pavements of giant clams in the lagoons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
__pt-br__ These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
__pt-br__ But still , now we have global warming .
__pt-br__ If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
__pt-br__ But the water gets warmer for too long and the corals die .
__pt-br__ So how are these fish , these predators going to help ?
__pt-br__ Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El Nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
__pt-br__ In Christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
__pt-br__ In Fanning Island , the corals are not recovered .
__pt-br__ But you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed .
__pt-br__ And the fish have grazed the algae , so the turf of algae is a little lower .
__pt-br__ Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
__pt-br__ And when you go to the pristine side , did this ever bleach ?
__pt-br__ These places bleached too , but they recovered faster .
__pt-br__ The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the resilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
__pt-br__ We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
__pt-br__ So if we have to reset the baseline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
__pt-br__ Well , there are several ways .
__pt-br__ One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
__pt-br__ And let me go back to that image of the Mediterranean .
__pt-br__ This was my baseline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
__pt-br__ And at the same time I was watching Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this richness and abundance and diversity .
__pt-br__ And I thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas , and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea .
__pt-br__ But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
__pt-br__ And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
__pt-br__ After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
__pt-br__ So you have this little algal forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscopic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system recovers .
__pt-br__ And this particular place , the Medes Islands Marine Reserve , is only 94 hectares , and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .
__pt-br__ So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
__pt-br__ So let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
__pt-br__ These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby , this is what happens .
__pt-br__ The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
__pt-br__ This is very substantial .
__pt-br__ The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
__pt-br__ The abundance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 170 percent .
__pt-br__ And the biomass — this is the most spectacular change — 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years .
__pt-br__ In some places up to 10 times larger biomass inside the reserves .
__pt-br__ So we have all these things inside the reserve that grow , and what do they do ?
__pt-br__ They reproduce . That &apos;s population biology 101 .
__pt-br__ If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .
__pt-br__ And same thing for invertebrates . This is the example .
__pt-br__ These are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of Chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
__pt-br__ Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
__pt-br__ One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
__pt-br__ So these organisms reproduce , the little larvae juveniles spill over , they all spill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
__pt-br__ This is in the Bahamas : Nassau grouper .
__pt-br__ Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
__pt-br__ So the fishermen are catching more .
__pt-br__ You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
__pt-br__ So there is spill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them , while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building resilience .
__pt-br__ So what we have now — or a world without reserves — is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit .
__pt-br__ Reserves are like savings accounts .
__pt-br__ We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
__pt-br__ And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves , this is like compound interest .
__pt-br__ Two examples , again , of how these reserves can benefit people .
__pt-br__ This is how much fishermen get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a free-for-all .
__pt-br__ Once the most degrading fishing gear , seine nets , were removed , the fishermen were catching more .
__pt-br__ If you fish less , you &apos;re actually catching more .
__pt-br__ But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
__pt-br__ Another example : Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef .
__pt-br__ This is grouper sex , and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of December and January for a week .
__pt-br__ They used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 groupers about this big in one hectare , in one aggregation .
__pt-br__ Fishermen knew about these things ; they caught them , and they depleted them .
__pt-br__ When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 groupers left .
__pt-br__ And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent of the entire spawning population every year .
__pt-br__ So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
__pt-br__ And with the fishery , the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct .
__pt-br__ It happened in many places around the Caribbean .
__pt-br__ And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fishery , several fishing boats .
__pt-br__ Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
__pt-br__ So how much of this do we have ?
__pt-br__ If this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
__pt-br__ And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
__pt-br__ Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
__pt-br__ The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
__pt-br__ Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
__pt-br__ Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
__pt-br__ Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices .
__pt-br__ Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .
__pt-br__ People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .
__pt-br__ A creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits .
__pt-br__ So how can we do that ?
__pt-br__ If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
__pt-br__ And how can we reach that goal ?
__pt-br__ Well , there are two ways of getting there .
__pt-br__ The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Chagos Archipelago .
__pt-br__ The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
__pt-br__ And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
__pt-br__ But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
__pt-br__ Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do , and fishermen tend to be really , really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
__pt-br__ Second , the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
__pt-br__ Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
__pt-br__ NGOs and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
__pt-br__ So marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money , and this is not sustainable .
__pt-br__ So the solutions are just fixing these three issues .
__pt-br__ First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
__pt-br__ Second , we need to redesign our governance so conservation efforts can be decentralized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from NGOs or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places .
__pt-br__ And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
__pt-br__ The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable .
__pt-br__ We really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
__pt-br__ There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
__pt-br__ The stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you Enric .
__pt-br__ Enric Sala : Thank you .
__pt-br__ CA : That was a masterful job of pulling things together .
__pt-br__ First of all , your pyramid , your inverted pyramid , showing 85 percent biomass in the predators , that seems impossible .
__pt-br__ How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
__pt-br__ ES : Well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
__pt-br__ The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s basically it .
__pt-br__ The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they reproduce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
__pt-br__ Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
__pt-br__ They reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
__pt-br__ So , basically , the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
__pt-br__ They are like capacitors of the system .
__pt-br__ CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
__pt-br__ So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
__pt-br__ ES : At least in the seas .
__pt-br__ What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the Serengeti , with five lions per wildebeest .
__pt-br__ And on land , this cannot work .
__pt-br__ But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
__pt-br__ We think this is universal .
__pt-br__ But we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently .
__pt-br__ CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
__pt-br__ It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fishermen as well .
__pt-br__ If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
__pt-br__ ES : And then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
__pt-br__ So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices .
__pt-br__ CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness .
__pt-br__ So thank you for those numbers .
__pt-br__ The last one &apos;s a personal question .
__pt-br__ A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degradation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , depressing .
__pt-br__ Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .
__pt-br__ ES : It is a spiritual experience .
__pt-br__ We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
__pt-br__ But the best feeling is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
__pt-br__ And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
__pt-br__ And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
__pt-br__ It would be just too depressing .
__pt-br__ CA : Well , Enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ES : Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__pt-br__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__pt-br__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__pt-br__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__pt-br__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__pt-br__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__pt-br__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__pt-br__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__pt-br__ We get it in the abstract .
__pt-br__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__pt-br__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__pt-br__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__pt-br__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__pt-br__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__pt-br__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__pt-br__ I think this is a problem .
__pt-br__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__pt-br__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__pt-br__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__pt-br__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__pt-br__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__pt-br__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__pt-br__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__pt-br__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__pt-br__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__pt-br__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__pt-br__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__pt-br__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__pt-br__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__pt-br__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__pt-br__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__pt-br__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__pt-br__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__pt-br__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__pt-br__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__pt-br__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__pt-br__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__pt-br__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__pt-br__ I call this error blindness .
__pt-br__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__pt-br__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__pt-br__ This is not mine , by the way .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__pt-br__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__pt-br__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__pt-br__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__pt-br__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__pt-br__ Okay , so fine .
__pt-br__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__pt-br__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__pt-br__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__pt-br__ So let me tell you a story .
__pt-br__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__pt-br__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__pt-br__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__pt-br__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__pt-br__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__pt-br__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__pt-br__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__pt-br__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__pt-br__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__pt-br__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__pt-br__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__pt-br__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__pt-br__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__pt-br__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__pt-br__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__pt-br__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__pt-br__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__pt-br__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__pt-br__ So this is a catastrophe .
__pt-br__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__pt-br__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__pt-br__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__pt-br__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__pt-br__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__pt-br__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__pt-br__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__pt-br__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__pt-br__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__pt-br__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__pt-br__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__pt-br__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__pt-br__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__pt-br__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__pt-br__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__pt-br__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__pt-br__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__pt-br__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__pt-br__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__pt-br__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__pt-br__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__pt-br__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__pt-br__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__pt-br__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__pt-br__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__pt-br__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__pt-br__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__pt-br__ And something else happened instead .
__pt-br__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__pt-br__ And something else happened instead .
__pt-br__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__pt-br__ And something else happened instead .
__pt-br__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__pt-br__ And something else happened instead .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__pt-br__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__pt-br__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__pt-br__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__pt-br__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__pt-br__ We come up with another idea .
__pt-br__ We tell another story .
__pt-br__ We hold another conference .
__pt-br__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__pt-br__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__pt-br__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__pt-br__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__pt-br__ My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
__pt-br__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__pt-br__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__pt-br__ That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
__pt-br__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__pt-br__ They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
__pt-br__ These were the men I called ammu , which means uncle .
__pt-br__ Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
__pt-br__ Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bullies .
__pt-br__ I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acquainted with being judged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
__pt-br__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__pt-br__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__pt-br__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__pt-br__ So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
__pt-br__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__pt-br__ I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
__pt-br__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__pt-br__ I am not my father .
__pt-br__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__pt-br__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__pt-br__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__pt-br__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__pt-br__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__pt-br__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s tedious .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__pt-br__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__pt-br__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__pt-br__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__pt-br__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__pt-br__ My idea is : no ! No !
__pt-br__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__pt-br__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__pt-br__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__pt-br__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__pt-br__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__pt-br__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__pt-br__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__pt-br__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__pt-br__ They know .
__pt-br__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__pt-br__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__pt-br__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__pt-br__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__pt-br__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__pt-br__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__pt-br__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__pt-br__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
__pt-br__ I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
__pt-br__ Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
__pt-br__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__pt-br__ This is a Klein bottle .
__pt-br__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__pt-br__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
__pt-br__ It has wonderful properties .
__pt-br__ If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__pt-br__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
__pt-br__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__pt-br__ This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__pt-br__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__pt-br__ That was a month of my life .
__pt-br__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__pt-br__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__pt-br__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__pt-br__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__pt-br__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__pt-br__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
__pt-br__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__pt-br__ And it sent me back .
__pt-br__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__pt-br__ This guy over here of course is me .
__pt-br__ This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__pt-br__ Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__pt-br__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
__pt-br__ He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__pt-br__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__pt-br__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__pt-br__ In the background , my bicycle .
__pt-br__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__pt-br__ Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
__pt-br__ We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__pt-br__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__pt-br__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
__pt-br__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__pt-br__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__pt-br__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__pt-br__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__pt-br__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__pt-br__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
__pt-br__ I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
__pt-br__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__pt-br__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
__pt-br__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__pt-br__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__pt-br__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
__pt-br__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__pt-br__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__pt-br__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__pt-br__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
__pt-br__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__pt-br__ You won &apos;t need to know trig .
__pt-br__ But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__pt-br__ None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__pt-br__ ( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__pt-br__ My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
__pt-br__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__pt-br__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__pt-br__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__pt-br__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__pt-br__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__pt-br__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__pt-br__ But , probably — one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__pt-br__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__pt-br__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__pt-br__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__pt-br__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__pt-br__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__pt-br__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__pt-br__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__pt-br__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
__pt-br__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__pt-br__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__pt-br__ The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__pt-br__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__pt-br__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__pt-br__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__pt-br__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
__pt-br__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
__pt-br__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
__pt-br__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
__pt-br__ But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__pt-br__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__pt-br__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__pt-br__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__pt-br__ Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
__pt-br__ And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
__pt-br__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__pt-br__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__pt-br__ He wants to clunk me over the head !
__pt-br__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
__pt-br__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__pt-br__ Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__pt-br__ Chases me into this room .
__pt-br__ The entranceway to the bell tower .
__pt-br__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__pt-br__ I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__pt-br__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
__pt-br__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__pt-br__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
__pt-br__ A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__pt-br__ Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
__pt-br__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__pt-br__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__pt-br__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
__pt-br__ Now , you all know what the postmortem is .
__pt-br__ Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__pt-br__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
__pt-br__ The number should be one .
__pt-br__ I ran through the numbers myself .
__pt-br__ Good morning !
__pt-br__ Are you awake ?
__pt-br__ So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
__pt-br__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__pt-br__ He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
__pt-br__ What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
__pt-br__ Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
__pt-br__ How could she speak that way ?
__pt-br__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__pt-br__ How did we get here ?
__pt-br__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__pt-br__ Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
__pt-br__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
__pt-br__ Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
__pt-br__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
__pt-br__ The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
__pt-br__ If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
__pt-br__ Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
__pt-br__ So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
__pt-br__ This is one reality .
__pt-br__ Arabic is the mother tongue .
__pt-br__ Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
__pt-br__ Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
__pt-br__ Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
__pt-br__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
__pt-br__ Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
__pt-br__ You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
__pt-br__ So , this is an example no one can argue with .
__pt-br__ Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
__pt-br__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__pt-br__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
__pt-br__ They make it sacred .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__pt-br__ Do we know better than them ?
__pt-br__ All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
__pt-br__ Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
__pt-br__ They kept it close to them .
__pt-br__ Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
__pt-br__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__pt-br__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__pt-br__ So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
__pt-br__ Regardless of the who , how and why .
__pt-br__ Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__pt-br__ Language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
__pt-br__ What is our intellect ?
__pt-br__ How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
__pt-br__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__pt-br__ How would you feel ?
__pt-br__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__pt-br__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__pt-br__ I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__pt-br__ I asked her once how things were going .
__pt-br__ He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
__pt-br__ Does she want to commit suicide ?
__pt-br__ &apos;Bury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
__pt-br__ It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
__pt-br__ Translate that for me .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
__pt-br__ We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
__pt-br__ Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
__pt-br__ Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
__pt-br__ The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
__pt-br__ We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
__pt-br__ And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
__pt-br__ We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
__pt-br__ So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
__pt-br__ Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
__pt-br__ After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
__pt-br__ Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
__pt-br__ We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
__pt-br__ If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
__pt-br__ We &apos;d have to find an existence .
__pt-br__ We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
__pt-br__ This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
__pt-br__ After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
__pt-br__ Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
__pt-br__ We are very cool !
__pt-br__ And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
__pt-br__ I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
__pt-br__ Creativity is the idea .
__pt-br__ At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s start from this moment .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
__pt-br__ A single novel could make us global again .
__pt-br__ It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
__pt-br__ But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
__pt-br__ In conclusion , what can you do today ?
__pt-br__ Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
__pt-br__ But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
__pt-br__ You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
__pt-br__ Second , there are many other things that we can do .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
__pt-br__ Now I will tell you a secret .
__pt-br__ A baby first identifies its father through language .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__pt-br__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__pt-br__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__pt-br__ I want to know how I impact them .
__pt-br__ I want to know how they impact me .
__pt-br__ I want to know why they fish .
__pt-br__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__pt-br__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__pt-br__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__pt-br__ So what do we call this ?
__pt-br__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__pt-br__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
__pt-br__ Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
__pt-br__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__pt-br__ Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__pt-br__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__pt-br__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__pt-br__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__pt-br__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__pt-br__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__pt-br__ Pole caught — no bycatch .
__pt-br__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__pt-br__ Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
__pt-br__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__pt-br__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__pt-br__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__pt-br__ Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__pt-br__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__pt-br__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__pt-br__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__pt-br__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__pt-br__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
__pt-br__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__pt-br__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__pt-br__ Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant .
__pt-br__ Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
__pt-br__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__pt-br__ Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__pt-br__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__pt-br__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__pt-br__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
__pt-br__ It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
__pt-br__ Whooo !
__pt-br__ This is an easy sell .
__pt-br__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__pt-br__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__pt-br__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__pt-br__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__pt-br__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
__pt-br__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__pt-br__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__pt-br__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s start there .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__pt-br__ Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
__pt-br__ But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
__pt-br__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
__pt-br__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__pt-br__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__pt-br__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
__pt-br__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__pt-br__ Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__pt-br__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood .
__pt-br__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__pt-br__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__pt-br__ A couple things happened .
__pt-br__ I made more money .
__pt-br__ People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
__pt-br__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__pt-br__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__pt-br__ They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
__pt-br__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__pt-br__ This is great .
__pt-br__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__pt-br__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
__pt-br__ Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
__pt-br__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__pt-br__ This is what we need to favor .
__pt-br__ This is what the green list says .
__pt-br__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__pt-br__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__pt-br__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__pt-br__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__pt-br__ Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
__pt-br__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__pt-br__ Put it on four plates .
__pt-br__ Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__pt-br__ Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__pt-br__ Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__pt-br__ I expect a lot from food .
__pt-br__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__pt-br__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
__pt-br__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__pt-br__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__pt-br__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__pt-br__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__pt-br__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__pt-br__ I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
__pt-br__ I get the meat sweats .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__pt-br__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__pt-br__ Eat your vegetables .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__pt-br__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__pt-br__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
__pt-br__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
__pt-br__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
__pt-br__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__pt-br__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__pt-br__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
__pt-br__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__pt-br__ We need to savor vegetables .
__pt-br__ We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
__pt-br__ And we need to save dinner .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Hi . I am an architect .
__pt-br__ I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
__pt-br__ 1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
__pt-br__ Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
__pt-br__ This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
__pt-br__ There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
__pt-br__ As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
__pt-br__ In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
__pt-br__ Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
__pt-br__ I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
__pt-br__ So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
__pt-br__ My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
__pt-br__ My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
__pt-br__ After , the building was recycled .
__pt-br__ So that was the goal of my design .
__pt-br__ Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
__pt-br__ Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
__pt-br__ So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
__pt-br__ We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
__pt-br__ Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
__pt-br__ That was the problem .
__pt-br__ Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
__pt-br__ But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
__pt-br__ They have money and power .
__pt-br__ Those are invisible .
__pt-br__ So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
__pt-br__ That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
__pt-br__ So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
__pt-br__ But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
__pt-br__ For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
__pt-br__ Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
__pt-br__ So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
__pt-br__ We can make it better .
__pt-br__ So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
__pt-br__ 1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
__pt-br__ Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
__pt-br__ Over two million people became refugees .
__pt-br__ But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
__pt-br__ They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
__pt-br__ But over two million people cut trees .
__pt-br__ It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
__pt-br__ That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
__pt-br__ Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
__pt-br__ So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
__pt-br__ We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
__pt-br__ And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
__pt-br__ Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
__pt-br__ And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
__pt-br__ So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
__pt-br__ After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot; &quot; So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
__pt-br__ I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
__pt-br__ They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
__pt-br__ So I proposed to rebuild . I raised — did fundraising .
__pt-br__ I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
__pt-br__ I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
__pt-br__ The color coordination is very important .
__pt-br__ And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disappointing .
__pt-br__ So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
__pt-br__ Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
__pt-br__ It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
__pt-br__ Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
__pt-br__ It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
__pt-br__ So this building became a permanent building .
__pt-br__ Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
__pt-br__ Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
__pt-br__ Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
__pt-br__ In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
__pt-br__ 2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
__pt-br__ In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
__pt-br__ And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
__pt-br__ I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
__pt-br__ I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
__pt-br__ In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
__pt-br__ In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
__pt-br__ And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
__pt-br__ And they are very kind , affording my model .
__pt-br__ I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
__pt-br__ So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
__pt-br__ Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
__pt-br__ Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
__pt-br__ This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
__pt-br__ After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
__pt-br__ But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
__pt-br__ People suffer mentally and physically .
__pt-br__ So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
__pt-br__ However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
__pt-br__ They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
__pt-br__ Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
__pt-br__ So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
__pt-br__ Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
__pt-br__ He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
__pt-br__ I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
__pt-br__ Many of the people want to stay here forever .
__pt-br__ I was very happy to hear that .
__pt-br__ Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
__pt-br__ About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
__pt-br__ And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
__pt-br__ So this is under construction .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__pt-br__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__pt-br__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
__pt-br__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__pt-br__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__pt-br__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__pt-br__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__pt-br__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__pt-br__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__pt-br__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__pt-br__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__pt-br__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
__pt-br__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__pt-br__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__pt-br__ What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
__pt-br__ Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__pt-br__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__pt-br__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__pt-br__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
__pt-br__ I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
__pt-br__ I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__pt-br__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__pt-br__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__pt-br__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__pt-br__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__pt-br__ On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__pt-br__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__pt-br__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__pt-br__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__pt-br__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__pt-br__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__pt-br__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__pt-br__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__pt-br__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__pt-br__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__pt-br__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
__pt-br__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__pt-br__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__pt-br__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__pt-br__ And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
__pt-br__ On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
__pt-br__ And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__pt-br__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__pt-br__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__pt-br__ And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__pt-br__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__pt-br__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
__pt-br__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__pt-br__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__pt-br__ So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__pt-br__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__pt-br__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__pt-br__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
__pt-br__ Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__pt-br__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
__pt-br__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__pt-br__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__pt-br__ My son is 23 .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__pt-br__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__pt-br__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__pt-br__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__pt-br__ So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__pt-br__ You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
__pt-br__ And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__pt-br__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__pt-br__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__pt-br__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__pt-br__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__pt-br__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__pt-br__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
__pt-br__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__pt-br__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__pt-br__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__pt-br__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__pt-br__ And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__pt-br__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__pt-br__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__pt-br__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__pt-br__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__pt-br__ And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__pt-br__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__pt-br__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__pt-br__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__pt-br__ This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
__pt-br__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
__pt-br__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__pt-br__ Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__pt-br__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__pt-br__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
__pt-br__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__pt-br__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__pt-br__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
__pt-br__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__pt-br__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__pt-br__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__pt-br__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__pt-br__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__pt-br__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__pt-br__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__pt-br__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__pt-br__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__pt-br__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__pt-br__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__pt-br__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__pt-br__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__pt-br__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__pt-br__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
__pt-br__ What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
__pt-br__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__pt-br__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__pt-br__ Same as the other side .
__pt-br__ Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__pt-br__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__pt-br__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__pt-br__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__pt-br__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__pt-br__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__pt-br__ Oh .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__pt-br__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__pt-br__ Not working either .
__pt-br__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__pt-br__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__pt-br__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__pt-br__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__pt-br__ So when you put four .
__pt-br__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__pt-br__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__pt-br__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__pt-br__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__pt-br__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__pt-br__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__pt-br__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__pt-br__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__pt-br__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__pt-br__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__pt-br__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__pt-br__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__pt-br__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__pt-br__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__pt-br__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__pt-br__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__pt-br__ So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
__pt-br__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__pt-br__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__pt-br__ So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
__pt-br__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__pt-br__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__pt-br__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__pt-br__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__pt-br__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__pt-br__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
__pt-br__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__pt-br__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__pt-br__ We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
__pt-br__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__pt-br__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__pt-br__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__pt-br__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__pt-br__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__pt-br__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__pt-br__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__pt-br__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__pt-br__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__pt-br__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__pt-br__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__pt-br__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__pt-br__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__pt-br__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__pt-br__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__pt-br__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__pt-br__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__pt-br__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__pt-br__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__pt-br__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__pt-br__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__pt-br__ They work in the field .
__pt-br__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__pt-br__ They have education programs .
__pt-br__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__pt-br__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__pt-br__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__pt-br__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__pt-br__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__pt-br__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__pt-br__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__pt-br__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__pt-br__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__pt-br__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__pt-br__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__pt-br__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__pt-br__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__pt-br__ This can happen .
__pt-br__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__pt-br__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__pt-br__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__pt-br__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__pt-br__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__pt-br__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__pt-br__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__pt-br__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__pt-br__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__pt-br__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__pt-br__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__pt-br__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__pt-br__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__pt-br__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__pt-br__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__pt-br__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__pt-br__ This is the transformation that took place .
__pt-br__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__pt-br__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__pt-br__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__pt-br__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__pt-br__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__pt-br__ The rocket was huge .
__pt-br__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__pt-br__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__pt-br__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__pt-br__ In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__pt-br__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__pt-br__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__pt-br__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__pt-br__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__pt-br__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__pt-br__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__pt-br__ All hell broke loose .
__pt-br__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__pt-br__ It provoked the missile gap .
__pt-br__ It exploded an arms race .
__pt-br__ It began the space race .
__pt-br__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__pt-br__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__pt-br__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__pt-br__ Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__pt-br__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__pt-br__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__pt-br__ Support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
__pt-br__ And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__pt-br__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
__pt-br__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__pt-br__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) .
__pt-br__ Thank you , Chris .

__pt-br__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__pt-br__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__pt-br__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__pt-br__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__pt-br__ Let me show you what I mean .
__pt-br__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__pt-br__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__pt-br__ All right . Very significant mark .
__pt-br__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__pt-br__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__pt-br__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__pt-br__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__pt-br__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__pt-br__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__pt-br__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__pt-br__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__pt-br__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__pt-br__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__pt-br__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__pt-br__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__pt-br__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__pt-br__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__pt-br__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__pt-br__ Wake up .
__pt-br__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__pt-br__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__pt-br__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__pt-br__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__pt-br__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__pt-br__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__pt-br__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__pt-br__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__pt-br__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__pt-br__ The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
__pt-br__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__pt-br__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__pt-br__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
__pt-br__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__pt-br__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
__pt-br__ And the third is a little bit less obvious .
__pt-br__ Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__pt-br__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__pt-br__ I grew up in Bihar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
__pt-br__ My brothers and I dug in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
__pt-br__ He was livid , and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us .
__pt-br__ Later , I understood why my father got so upset .
__pt-br__ Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract .
__pt-br__ My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar , and he had developed a firm stance against corruption , even though he was harassed and threatened .
__pt-br__ His was a lonely struggle , because Bihar was also India &apos;s most corrupt state , where public officials were enriching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling .
__pt-br__ And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
__pt-br__ And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was famished and exhausted , and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me .
__pt-br__ Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
__pt-br__ This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
__pt-br__ I resolved to give back .
__pt-br__ Later , I joined the World Bank , which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries .
__pt-br__ My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans .
__pt-br__ But after we disbursed the loans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers , new health clinics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or recourse .
__pt-br__ It was Bihar all over again .
__pt-br__ Bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
__pt-br__ Globally , 1.3 billion people live on less than $ 1.25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 , when winners of World War II , 500 founding fathers , and one lonely founding mother , gathered in New Hampshire , USA , to establish the Bretton Woods institutions , including the World Bank .
__pt-br__ And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South , accompanied by reform prescriptions .
__pt-br__ Second , the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque , with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved .
__pt-br__ And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance .
__pt-br__ Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
__pt-br__ Open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__pt-br__ The first key shift is open knowledge .
__pt-br__ You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
__pt-br__ They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know-how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
__pt-br__ They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children .
__pt-br__ This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s Oportunidades today inspiring New York City .
__pt-br__ And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers .
__pt-br__ This is the second shift : open aid .
__pt-br__ Recently , the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
__pt-br__ Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance .
__pt-br__ Take GeoMapping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located , and the darker the shade of green , the more the number of out-of-school children .
__pt-br__ So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
__pt-br__ In this manner , the World Bank has now GeoMapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries , and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
__pt-br__ This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid .
__pt-br__ And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
__pt-br__ From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability .
__pt-br__ Are governments delivering services to the citizens ?
__pt-br__ So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
__pt-br__ But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
__pt-br__ This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
__pt-br__ To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it &apos;s more understandable to the public .
__pt-br__ In this map from Moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
__pt-br__ Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
__pt-br__ So in the Philippines today , parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website , Checkmyschool.org , or using SMS , whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school , the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar .
__pt-br__ And the government is responsive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action .
__pt-br__ And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Philippines to Indonesia , Kenya , Moldova and beyond .
__pt-br__ In Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
__pt-br__ This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
__pt-br__ And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggregated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
__pt-br__ Today , even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and responsive to the poor .
__pt-br__ But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
__pt-br__ These are the lonely warriors like my father and many , many others , and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
__pt-br__ So for instance , today , in Ghana , courageous reformers from civil society , Parliament and government , have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector , and , galvanized by this , reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts .
__pt-br__ These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar .
__pt-br__ Two years ago , on April 8th , 2010 , I called my father .
__pt-br__ It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project .
__pt-br__ Though he was no lawyer , he argued the case in court himself the next day . He won the ruling , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
__pt-br__ He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
__pt-br__ These became the two bookends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape .
__pt-br__ Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
__pt-br__ We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practitioners , so aid becomes transparent , accountable and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government .
__pt-br__ We need to accelerate these shifts .
__pt-br__ If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar , in Uganda , and beyond .
__pt-br__ We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
__pt-br__ We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
__pt-br__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
__pt-br__ Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
__pt-br__ 6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
__pt-br__ Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
__pt-br__ Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn &apos;t some smart , new technological innovations .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
__pt-br__ Washing hands with soap , a habit we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by one third .
__pt-br__ Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , trachoma , SARS , and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap .
__pt-br__ Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
__pt-br__ It stops babies from dying .
__pt-br__ Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
__pt-br__ It can save over 600,000 children every year .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
__pt-br__ I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
__pt-br__ So now just take a minute .
__pt-br__ I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
__pt-br__ Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
__pt-br__ Please shake their hands .
__pt-br__ All right , get to know each other .
__pt-br__ They look really pretty .
__pt-br__ All right .
__pt-br__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__pt-br__ Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
__pt-br__ Well , statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don &apos;t wash their hands when they come out of the toilet , globally .
__pt-br__ And the same way , we don &apos;t do it when we &apos;ve got fancy toilets , running water , and soap available , it &apos;s the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high .
__pt-br__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__pt-br__ Actually , soap is available .
__pt-br__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__pt-br__ Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
__pt-br__ So why is it ?
__pt-br__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__pt-br__ Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__pt-br__ Well , in Mayank &apos;s family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
__pt-br__ His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cupboard .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__pt-br__ On average , in Mayank &apos;s family , they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s the result of that ?
__pt-br__ Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
__pt-br__ Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
__pt-br__ Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
__pt-br__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__pt-br__ I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life .
__pt-br__ However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
__pt-br__ Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
__pt-br__ Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand .
__pt-br__ Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__pt-br__ Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
__pt-br__ Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__pt-br__ And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
__pt-br__ Just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap .
__pt-br__ The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera .
__pt-br__ Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment .
__pt-br__ A hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
__pt-br__ I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
__pt-br__ Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
__pt-br__ The budget is not always there .
__pt-br__ And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
__pt-br__ In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap .
__pt-br__ Win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
__pt-br__ Win for the private sector , because we build new generations of future handwashers .
__pt-br__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__pt-br__ On October 15 , we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day .
__pt-br__ Schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world &apos;s most important public health intervention .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s required , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , creative thinking that drives advocacy .
__pt-br__ If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign , we &apos;ve created great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve had over 30 million views .
__pt-br__ Most of these discussions are still happening online .
__pt-br__ I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
__pt-br__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__pt-br__ I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
__pt-br__ I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
__pt-br__ I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
__pt-br__ We run today the world &apos;s largest handwashing program by any public health standards .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
__pt-br__ My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
__pt-br__ Over the last four years , business has grown double digits , whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased .
__pt-br__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__pt-br__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__pt-br__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__pt-br__ This one is from Myanmar .
__pt-br__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__pt-br__ Her son , Myo , is her second one .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equip her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn .
__pt-br__ And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
__pt-br__ Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
__pt-br__ These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
__pt-br__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__pt-br__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__pt-br__ The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__pt-br__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__pt-br__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__pt-br__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__pt-br__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__pt-br__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__pt-br__ Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
__pt-br__ Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
__pt-br__ Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
__pt-br__ These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
__pt-br__ Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
__pt-br__ Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
__pt-br__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__pt-br__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__pt-br__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__pt-br__ And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
__pt-br__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__pt-br__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__pt-br__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ But that can &apos;t be right .
__pt-br__ I am for chocolate donuts .
__pt-br__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
__pt-br__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__pt-br__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__pt-br__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__pt-br__ So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
__pt-br__ A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__pt-br__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__pt-br__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__pt-br__ And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
__pt-br__ This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
__pt-br__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__pt-br__ To give you a sense of scale , the largest panel is about two meters high .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s about this much . And the smallest one is an A4 .
__pt-br__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
__pt-br__ So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
__pt-br__ The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
__pt-br__ The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
__pt-br__ So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera .
__pt-br__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__pt-br__ One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s a video .
__pt-br__ You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
__pt-br__ This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
__pt-br__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__pt-br__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__pt-br__ So here is the first test scenario .
__pt-br__ You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
__pt-br__ It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__pt-br__ Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__pt-br__ This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap , how hard , for how long , how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others , and if they want to contribute to innovation .
__pt-br__ So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
__pt-br__ So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
__pt-br__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
__pt-br__ It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
__pt-br__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__pt-br__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
__pt-br__ It comes out of the idea of a window .
__pt-br__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__pt-br__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__pt-br__ So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__pt-br__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__pt-br__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ And I would want to do that like that .
__pt-br__ That would be the plan .
__pt-br__ I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
__pt-br__ This is how the year would go .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
__pt-br__ How hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
__pt-br__ No big deal , right ?
__pt-br__ They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff .
__pt-br__ And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
__pt-br__ And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline , still not having written a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours , pulling not one but two all-nighters — humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters — sprinted across campus , dove in slow motion , and got it in just at the deadline .
__pt-br__ I thought that was the end of everything .
__pt-br__ It was a very , very bad thesis . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ No , no , it was very , very bad .
__pt-br__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__pt-br__ I write the blog Wait But Why .
__pt-br__ And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
__pt-br__ here &apos;s my brain .
__pt-br__ Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today .
__pt-br__ Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Sigh ) Now , what is going on here ?
__pt-br__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
__pt-br__ You have to keep well-slept , well-fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
__pt-br__ We can see the big picture .
__pt-br__ We can make long-term plans .
__pt-br__ And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
__pt-br__ Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you &apos;re having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time .
__pt-br__ But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant , for the sake of the big picture .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
__pt-br__ I call it the Dark Playground .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Now , the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening .
__pt-br__ And the question is , in this situation , with the Monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
__pt-br__ Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
__pt-br__ He was saying , &quot; &quot; Are we clear on what we just accepted ?
__pt-br__ Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
__pt-br__ As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
__pt-br__ And I opened up the website , and there was my face staring right back at me .
__pt-br__ And guess who woke up ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system &apos;s in mayhem . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ And finally , finally , the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk .
__pt-br__ And this entire situation , with the three characters — this is the procrastinator &apos;s system .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__pt-br__ This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
__pt-br__ When I did , I was amazed by the response .
__pt-br__ Literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
__pt-br__ These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
__pt-br__ Why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
__pt-br__ Everything I &apos;ve talked about today , the examples I &apos;ve given , they all have deadlines .
__pt-br__ And when there &apos;s deadlines , the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s this long-term kind of procrastination that &apos;s much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier , short-term deadline-based kind .
__pt-br__ And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cramming for some project .
__pt-br__ The frustration is not that they couldn &apos;t achieve their dreams ; it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t even able to start chasing them .
__pt-br__ So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany — that I don &apos;t think non-procrastinators exist .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastinators .
__pt-br__ Now , I want to show you one last thing .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s not that many boxes , especially since we &apos;ve already used a bunch of those .
__pt-br__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__pt-br__ We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastinating on , because everyone is procrastinating on something in life .
__pt-br__ We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__pt-br__ And because there &apos;s not that many boxes on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) You know .
__pt-br__ Sometime soon .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
__pt-br__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
__pt-br__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__pt-br__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__pt-br__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__pt-br__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__pt-br__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
__pt-br__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__pt-br__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__pt-br__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__pt-br__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__pt-br__ If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
__pt-br__ And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
__pt-br__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__pt-br__ These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
__pt-br__ The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
__pt-br__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__pt-br__ So I said something .
__pt-br__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__pt-br__ She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
__pt-br__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__pt-br__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__pt-br__ They have violated this deep-seated social contract .
__pt-br__ This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
__pt-br__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
__pt-br__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__pt-br__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__pt-br__ the people to save the numbers .
__pt-br__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__pt-br__ And Bob refused .
__pt-br__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__pt-br__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__pt-br__ And so they came up with a furlough program .
__pt-br__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
__pt-br__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__pt-br__ We call them leaders because they go first .
__pt-br__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__pt-br__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__pt-br__ And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
__pt-br__ So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
__pt-br__ We went back to the drawing board .
__pt-br__ So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
__pt-br__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
__pt-br__ The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
__pt-br__ So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__pt-br__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__pt-br__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__pt-br__ Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
__pt-br__ Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
__pt-br__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
__pt-br__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__pt-br__ and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
__pt-br__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__pt-br__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__pt-br__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
__pt-br__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__pt-br__ So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
__pt-br__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__pt-br__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__pt-br__ So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
__pt-br__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__pt-br__ And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
__pt-br__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__pt-br__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__pt-br__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__pt-br__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
__pt-br__ DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
__pt-br__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__pt-br__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause . )
__pt-br__ Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
__pt-br__ I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
__pt-br__ There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
__pt-br__ The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
__pt-br__ So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
__pt-br__ Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
__pt-br__ And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
__pt-br__ In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
__pt-br__ In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
__pt-br__ In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
__pt-br__ After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
__pt-br__ You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
__pt-br__ So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
__pt-br__ And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
__pt-br__ So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
__pt-br__ At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
__pt-br__ And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
__pt-br__ Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
__pt-br__ We call this value-based healthcare .
__pt-br__ On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
__pt-br__ This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
__pt-br__ On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
__pt-br__ When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
__pt-br__ You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
__pt-br__ The differences were dramatic .
__pt-br__ Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
__pt-br__ Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
__pt-br__ If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
__pt-br__ You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
__pt-br__ If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
__pt-br__ Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
__pt-br__ When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
__pt-br__ But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
__pt-br__ And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
__pt-br__ Nobody knows .
__pt-br__ So going the hospital is a lottery .
__pt-br__ Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
__pt-br__ In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
__pt-br__ To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
__pt-br__ They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
__pt-br__ They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
__pt-br__ So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
__pt-br__ And they finally agreed .
__pt-br__ And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
__pt-br__ Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
__pt-br__ They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
__pt-br__ Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
__pt-br__ Since then , they publish every year .
__pt-br__ Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
__pt-br__ And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
__pt-br__ For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
__pt-br__ Now I found this principle really exciting .
__pt-br__ So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
__pt-br__ Continuous improvement .
__pt-br__ Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s exciting in itself .
__pt-br__ But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
__pt-br__ So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
__pt-br__ They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
__pt-br__ In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
__pt-br__ So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
__pt-br__ Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
__pt-br__ We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
__pt-br__ OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
__pt-br__ The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
__pt-br__ Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
__pt-br__ Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
__pt-br__ This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
__pt-br__ The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
__pt-br__ In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
__pt-br__ The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
__pt-br__ Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
__pt-br__ They were always best in class .
__pt-br__ We were always best in class .
__pt-br__ And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
__pt-br__ But most of them don &apos;t know .
__pt-br__ But physicians have another characteristic .
__pt-br__ They actually thrive from peer recognition .
__pt-br__ If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
__pt-br__ They will share the information on how to improve .
__pt-br__ So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
__pt-br__ Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
__pt-br__ This is happening in reality .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
__pt-br__ Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
__pt-br__ You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
__pt-br__ It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
__pt-br__ The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
__pt-br__ Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
__pt-br__ In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
__pt-br__ Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
__pt-br__ Why is that ?
__pt-br__ Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
__pt-br__ They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
__pt-br__ This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
__pt-br__ The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
__pt-br__ Can we measure it better than we do ?
__pt-br__ We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
__pt-br__ And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
__pt-br__ There was an enormous energy in the room .
__pt-br__ There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
__pt-br__ At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
__pt-br__ He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__pt-br__ Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
__pt-br__ I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
__pt-br__ We learned a lot from those failures .
__pt-br__ So I looked at these five .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__pt-br__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__pt-br__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__pt-br__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__pt-br__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__pt-br__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__pt-br__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__pt-br__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__pt-br__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__pt-br__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__pt-br__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__pt-br__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__pt-br__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__pt-br__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__pt-br__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__pt-br__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__pt-br__ You see that glass of water ?
__pt-br__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__pt-br__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__pt-br__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__pt-br__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__pt-br__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__pt-br__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__pt-br__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__pt-br__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__pt-br__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__pt-br__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__pt-br__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__pt-br__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__pt-br__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__pt-br__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__pt-br__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__pt-br__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__pt-br__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__pt-br__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__pt-br__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__pt-br__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__pt-br__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__pt-br__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__pt-br__ The light never goes out .
__pt-br__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__pt-br__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__pt-br__ Or is it photography ?
__pt-br__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__pt-br__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__pt-br__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__pt-br__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__pt-br__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__pt-br__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__pt-br__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__pt-br__ Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__pt-br__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__pt-br__ And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
__pt-br__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__pt-br__ When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
__pt-br__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__pt-br__ Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__pt-br__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__pt-br__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__pt-br__ Is it something about the light ?
__pt-br__ What creates the illusion ?
__pt-br__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__pt-br__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__pt-br__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__pt-br__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__pt-br__ And let me show you a simple example .
__pt-br__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__pt-br__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__pt-br__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__pt-br__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__pt-br__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__pt-br__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__pt-br__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__pt-br__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__pt-br__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__pt-br__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__pt-br__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__pt-br__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__pt-br__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__pt-br__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__pt-br__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__pt-br__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s another example .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__pt-br__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__pt-br__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__pt-br__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__pt-br__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__pt-br__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__pt-br__ The shores are from a different location .
__pt-br__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__pt-br__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__pt-br__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__pt-br__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__pt-br__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__pt-br__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__pt-br__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__pt-br__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__pt-br__ Thank you .

__pt-br__ &#91; On April 3 , 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history . &#93; &#91; The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain . &#93; This week , there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca .
__pt-br__ The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world .
__pt-br__ Now , this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions .
__pt-br__ The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s been allegations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cellist .
__pt-br__ And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents .
__pt-br__ Now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel .
__pt-br__ It seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
__pt-br__ Why should we care about this ?
__pt-br__ We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets — something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
__pt-br__ Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
__pt-br__ I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll .
__pt-br__ So you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s perhaps because some prominent US people just haven &apos;t figured in this exposé , in this scandal .
__pt-br__ Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients .
__pt-br__ I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
__pt-br__ In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
__pt-br__ That sort of secrecy in America has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren .
__pt-br__ It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
__pt-br__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__pt-br__ Now , at Global Witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
__pt-br__ How does this actually work ?
__pt-br__ So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms .
__pt-br__ Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
__pt-br__ These were all preliminary meetings , and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
__pt-br__ This is not just about an individual lawyer who &apos;s spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician who &apos;s been caught up in a scandal .
__pt-br__ This is about how a system works , that entrenches corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
__pt-br__ Over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership .
__pt-br__ This issue was put on the political agenda by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a big G8 Summit that was held in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
__pt-br__ One of the things that is sad is that , actually , the US is lagging behind .
__pt-br__ So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
__pt-br__ For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
__pt-br__ We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
__pt-br__ We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Secrecy like this is not good for business . &quot;
__pt-br__ We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
__pt-br__ Together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
__pt-br__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__pt-br__ Can that possibly be true ?
__pt-br__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__pt-br__ CA : How does it work ?
__pt-br__ How do people release the documents ?
__pt-br__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__pt-br__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__pt-br__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__pt-br__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__pt-br__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__pt-br__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__pt-br__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__pt-br__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__pt-br__ If we can have this document up ...
__pt-br__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__pt-br__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__pt-br__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__pt-br__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__pt-br__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__pt-br__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__pt-br__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__pt-br__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__pt-br__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__pt-br__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__pt-br__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__pt-br__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__pt-br__ And so it came in from the outside .
__pt-br__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__pt-br__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__pt-br__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__pt-br__ JA : Yep .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__pt-br__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__pt-br__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__pt-br__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__pt-br__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__pt-br__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__pt-br__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__pt-br__ Light &apos; em all up .
__pt-br__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__pt-br__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__pt-br__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__pt-br__ we need to move , time now !
__pt-br__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__pt-br__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__pt-br__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__pt-br__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__pt-br__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__pt-br__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__pt-br__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__pt-br__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__pt-br__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__pt-br__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__pt-br__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__pt-br__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__pt-br__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__pt-br__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__pt-br__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__pt-br__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__pt-br__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__pt-br__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__pt-br__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__pt-br__ I mean , did he ?
__pt-br__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__pt-br__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__pt-br__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__pt-br__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__pt-br__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__pt-br__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__pt-br__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__pt-br__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__pt-br__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__pt-br__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__pt-br__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__pt-br__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__pt-br__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__pt-br__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__pt-br__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__pt-br__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__pt-br__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__pt-br__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__pt-br__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__pt-br__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__pt-br__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__pt-br__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__pt-br__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__pt-br__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__pt-br__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__pt-br__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__pt-br__ Light is good .
__pt-br__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__pt-br__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__pt-br__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__pt-br__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__pt-br__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__pt-br__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__pt-br__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__pt-br__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__pt-br__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__pt-br__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__pt-br__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__pt-br__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__pt-br__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__pt-br__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__pt-br__ What is this ?
__pt-br__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__pt-br__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__pt-br__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__pt-br__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__pt-br__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__pt-br__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__pt-br__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__pt-br__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__pt-br__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__pt-br__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__pt-br__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__pt-br__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__pt-br__ Yeah .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__pt-br__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__pt-br__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__pt-br__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__pt-br__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a problem .
__pt-br__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__pt-br__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__pt-br__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__pt-br__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__pt-br__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__pt-br__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__pt-br__ Can that be right ?
__pt-br__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__pt-br__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__pt-br__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__pt-br__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__pt-br__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__pt-br__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__pt-br__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__pt-br__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__pt-br__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__pt-br__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__pt-br__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__pt-br__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__pt-br__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__pt-br__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__pt-br__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__pt-br__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__pt-br__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__pt-br__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__pt-br__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__pt-br__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__pt-br__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__pt-br__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__pt-br__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__pt-br__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__pt-br__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__pt-br__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__pt-br__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__pt-br__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__pt-br__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__pt-br__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__pt-br__ CA : Wow .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__pt-br__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__pt-br__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__pt-br__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__pt-br__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__pt-br__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__pt-br__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Nothing worked in Iceland that day , because nothing works when women are not at work .
__pt-br__ And it was the journey of my life .
__pt-br__ It was amazing .
__pt-br__ The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates .
__pt-br__ I did not even make the graph in the newspaper .
__pt-br__ The foremost challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with media , muscle and money .
__pt-br__ I can &apos;t say that I agree .
__pt-br__ It proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media .
__pt-br__ And I am not saying media is doing this consciously .
__pt-br__ But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s possible to run a different type of campaign .
__pt-br__ And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less .
__pt-br__ I surprised myself , as you may see in that photo .
__pt-br__ This was probably the highlight of my campaign .
__pt-br__ What we see , we can be .
__pt-br__ So screw fear and challenges .
__pt-br__ But rest assured , it was hard work .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s having people around you who share your values , your vision , but are different in every other way .
__pt-br__ We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves .
__pt-br__ Second one is &quot; &quot; Gleði , &quot; &quot; or joy .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not letting you go yet . Halla Tómasdóttir : What a great crowd . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
__pt-br__ This little boy is looking up at his father , and he says , &quot; &quot; Daddy , when I grow up , I want to be a former president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I have had a great blessing as a former president , because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe .
__pt-br__ Not only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States , but also my wife and I have visited more than 145 countries in the world , and the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth .
__pt-br__ And a lot of times , when we go into a country , we not only the meet the king or the president , but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa .
__pt-br__ So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as I do , I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is , strangely , not addressed quite often , is the abuse of women and girls .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) There are a couple of reasons for this that I &apos;ll mention to begin with .
__pt-br__ And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God .
__pt-br__ That is an all-pervasive problem , because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer , for instance , wants to cheat women , they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God , why should I treat them as equals myself ?
__pt-br__ Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work ?
__pt-br__ The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence , and that is increasing tremendously around the world .
__pt-br__ When I was in office as governor of Georgia , one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison .
__pt-br__ Nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a sevenfold increase .
__pt-br__ And since I left the White House , there &apos;s been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison .
__pt-br__ We also have &#91; one of the only countries &#93; on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country .
__pt-br__ And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty .
__pt-br__ If you add that up , that &apos;s 307 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed .
__pt-br__ One is genital mutilation .
__pt-br__ And sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate .
__pt-br__ And then later , when she gets married , the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex .
__pt-br__ This is not a rare thing , although it &apos;s against the law in most countries .
__pt-br__ This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries .
__pt-br__ Another very serious thing is honor killings , where a family with misinterpretation , again , of a holy scripture — there &apos;s nothing in the Quran that mandates this — will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve , or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing .
__pt-br__ And this is done by members of her own family , so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family .
__pt-br__ There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century .
__pt-br__ There are 30 million people now living in slavery .
__pt-br__ The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year , and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold across international borders every year into slavery , and that 80 percent of those sold are women , into sexual slavery .
__pt-br__ In the United States right this moment , 60,000 people are living in human bondage , or slavery .
__pt-br__ Atlanta , Georgia , where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University , they have between 200 and 300 women , people sold into slavery every month .
__pt-br__ A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that , and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $ 35,000 per slave .
__pt-br__ The sex trade in Atlanta , Georgia , exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta , Georgia .
__pt-br__ Sweden has got a good approach to it .
__pt-br__ In the United States , we take just the opposite position .
__pt-br__ For every male arrested for illegal sex trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America .
__pt-br__ Canada , Ireland , I &apos;ve already said Sweden , France , and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s another thing that can be done .
__pt-br__ We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire : our military and our great university system .
__pt-br__ In the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place .
__pt-br__ That law needs to be changed .
__pt-br__ The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists , because outside of the university system , if they rape somebody , they &apos;ll be prosecuted , but when they get on a university campus , they can rape with impunity .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re not prosecuted .
__pt-br__ Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
__pt-br__ When I became president , the difference was 39 percent .
__pt-br__ So we &apos;ve made some progress , partially because I was president and so forth — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , there &apos;s been no progress made , so it &apos;s been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years .
__pt-br__ These are the kind of things that go on .
__pt-br__ Well , that &apos;s what goes on in our country .
__pt-br__ Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth .
__pt-br__ We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War .
__pt-br__ Sometimes , we &apos;ve had soldiers on the ground fighting .
__pt-br__ But anyway , those kinds of things , the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes , are the basic causes , of abuse of women and girls .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s one more basic cause that I need not mention , and that is that in general , men don &apos;t give a damn .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
__pt-br__ But during that time , there were many white people that didn &apos;t think that racial discrimination was okay , but they stayed quiet , because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs , unique access to jury duty , better schools , and everything else , and that &apos;s the same thing that exists today , because the average man really doesn &apos;t care .
__pt-br__ Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against discrimination against girls and women , &quot; &quot; they enjoy a privileged position .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t even go down to detail about that .
__pt-br__ But I hope that out of this conference , that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market , need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters .
__pt-br__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__pt-br__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__pt-br__ I will not dance to that beating .
__pt-br__ I know that beat .
__pt-br__ It is lifeless .
__pt-br__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__pt-br__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__pt-br__ I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
__pt-br__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__pt-br__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__pt-br__ I will not kill for you .
__pt-br__ Especially I will not die for you .
__pt-br__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__pt-br__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__pt-br__ Everyone can be wrong .
__pt-br__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__pt-br__ I will not forget where I come from .
__pt-br__ I will craft my own drum .
__pt-br__ Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
__pt-br__ Our humming will be drumming .
__pt-br__ I will not be played .
__pt-br__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__pt-br__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__pt-br__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__pt-br__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
__pt-br__ Confused , aspiring pacifists .
__pt-br__ I understand .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__pt-br__ Like a lot .
__pt-br__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__pt-br__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
__pt-br__ What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__pt-br__ Poetry does that .
__pt-br__ It preps you . It aims you .
__pt-br__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__pt-br__ Hold her now with you .
__pt-br__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__pt-br__ Are you holding her ?
__pt-br__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__pt-br__ Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
__pt-br__ But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__pt-br__ Whose son shall it be ?
__pt-br__ Which male child will perish a new day ?
__pt-br__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
__pt-br__ We cherish corpses .
__pt-br__ We mourn women , complicated .
__pt-br__ Bitches get beat daily .
__pt-br__ Profits made , prophets ignored .
__pt-br__ War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
__pt-br__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__pt-br__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__pt-br__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__pt-br__ Rhythm is half silence .
__pt-br__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__pt-br__ Sickness , health , tender violence .
__pt-br__ I think now I never was pure .
__pt-br__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am .
__pt-br__ Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
__pt-br__ I never was pure .
__pt-br__ Girl spoiled before ripened .
__pt-br__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__pt-br__ I experience exponentially .
__pt-br__ Everything is everything .
__pt-br__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__pt-br__ One woman loses six .
__pt-br__ One woman loses her head .
__pt-br__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__pt-br__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__pt-br__ One woman straps herself .
__pt-br__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__pt-br__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__pt-br__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__pt-br__ One woman never did .
__pt-br__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__pt-br__ Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__pt-br__ Faced with absence .
__pt-br__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
__pt-br__ My spine curves spiral .
__pt-br__ Precipice running to and running from human beings .
__pt-br__ Cluster bombs left behind .
__pt-br__ De facto landmines .
__pt-br__ A smoldering grief .
__pt-br__ Harvest contaminated tobacco .
__pt-br__ Harvest bombs .
__pt-br__ Harvest baby teeth .
__pt-br__ Harvest palms , smoke .
__pt-br__ Harvest witness , smoke .
__pt-br__ Resolutions , smoke .
__pt-br__ Salvation , smoke .
__pt-br__ Redemption , smoke .
__pt-br__ Breathe .
__pt-br__ Do not fear what has blown up .
__pt-br__ If you must , fear the unexploded .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__pt-br__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__pt-br__ Global famine was inevitable .
__pt-br__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
__pt-br__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__pt-br__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__pt-br__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__pt-br__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__pt-br__ Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__pt-br__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__pt-br__ Per-capita food production is up by a third .
__pt-br__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__pt-br__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__pt-br__ How did we achieve that ?
__pt-br__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
__pt-br__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__pt-br__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__pt-br__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__pt-br__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__pt-br__ These are both real objects .
__pt-br__ One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__pt-br__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__pt-br__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__pt-br__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__pt-br__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__pt-br__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__pt-br__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__pt-br__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__pt-br__ The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__pt-br__ And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__pt-br__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve come together .
__pt-br__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__pt-br__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__pt-br__ In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__pt-br__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__pt-br__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
__pt-br__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__pt-br__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__pt-br__ No other animal does it .
__pt-br__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__pt-br__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__pt-br__ You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
__pt-br__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__pt-br__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__pt-br__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__pt-br__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__pt-br__ Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__pt-br__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__pt-br__ Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
__pt-br__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__pt-br__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__pt-br__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__pt-br__ So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
__pt-br__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__pt-br__ He can make his own spears and axes .
__pt-br__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__pt-br__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
__pt-br__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__pt-br__ And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__pt-br__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__pt-br__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__pt-br__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__pt-br__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__pt-br__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__pt-br__ You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
__pt-br__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__pt-br__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__pt-br__ And the answer is about half a second .
__pt-br__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__pt-br__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__pt-br__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__pt-br__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__pt-br__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__pt-br__ It was self-sufficiency .
__pt-br__ We call that poverty these days .
__pt-br__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__pt-br__ How many other people ?
__pt-br__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__pt-br__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__pt-br__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__pt-br__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__pt-br__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__pt-br__ Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
__pt-br__ They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
__pt-br__ He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__pt-br__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__pt-br__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__pt-br__ Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__pt-br__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__pt-br__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__pt-br__ The queen does it all .
__pt-br__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__pt-br__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__pt-br__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__pt-br__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__pt-br__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__pt-br__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__pt-br__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__pt-br__ The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__pt-br__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
__pt-br__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__pt-br__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__pt-br__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__pt-br__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__pt-br__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__pt-br__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__pt-br__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__pt-br__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__pt-br__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__pt-br__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__pt-br__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__pt-br__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__pt-br__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__pt-br__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re always made from local chert .
__pt-br__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
__pt-br__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__pt-br__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__pt-br__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__pt-br__ Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__pt-br__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__pt-br__ You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__pt-br__ And that will have led to specialization .
__pt-br__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__pt-br__ Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
__pt-br__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__pt-br__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__pt-br__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__pt-br__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__pt-br__ An example is Tasmania .
__pt-br__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
__pt-br__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
__pt-br__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__pt-br__ It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
__pt-br__ The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__pt-br__ The Tasmanians were isolated .
__pt-br__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__pt-br__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__pt-br__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__pt-br__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__pt-br__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__pt-br__ I mean this quite seriously .
__pt-br__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__pt-br__ He just knows how to run a company .
__pt-br__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__pt-br__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__pt-br__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__pt-br__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__pt-br__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__pt-br__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__pt-br__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__pt-br__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__pt-br__ However , bad things happen .
__pt-br__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__pt-br__ There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
__pt-br__ Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__pt-br__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Good afternoon .
__pt-br__ My name is Uldus .
__pt-br__ I am a photo-based artist from Russia .
__pt-br__ I focus on balancing meaningful message , aesthetic , beauty , composition , some irony , and artifacts .
__pt-br__ Today , I &apos;m going to tell you about my project , which is named Desperate Romantics .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re my artifacts , or paintings from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England mid-19th century .
__pt-br__ I took the painting and gifted new , contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in Russia , capturing people who are non-models but have an interesting story .
__pt-br__ This boy is a professional dancer , only 12 years old , but at secondary school , he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality , trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality .
__pt-br__ But this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Russia .
__pt-br__ Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
__pt-br__ And this is Nikita , a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg .
__pt-br__ He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quoting Hulk from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
__pt-br__ He hides his sensitivities and romantic side , because in Russia , among guys , that &apos;s not cool to be romantic , but it &apos;s cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes , in my project , I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temptation about it .
__pt-br__ Sometimes , I would compare facial features and playing with words : irony , Iron Man , ironing man .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Through the artifacts , I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the conversation .
__pt-br__ Interesting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re taught from childhood , successful marriage means successful life , so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband .
__pt-br__ And what about me ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m 27 years old .
__pt-br__ For Russian society , I &apos;m an old maid and hopeless to ever get married .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask , in the wedding dress , all desperate in my garden .
__pt-br__ But remember , irony is the key , and this is actually to motivate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stereotypes .
__pt-br__ Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
__pt-br__ Be funny and create some magic .

__pt-br__ My name is Amit .
__pt-br__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__pt-br__ And it took 18 months .
__pt-br__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__pt-br__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__pt-br__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__pt-br__ And I grew up in India .
__pt-br__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__pt-br__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__pt-br__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__pt-br__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__pt-br__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__pt-br__ You look around at all these museums here .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__pt-br__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__pt-br__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__pt-br__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__pt-br__ You move around , you have fun .
__pt-br__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__pt-br__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__pt-br__ Keep going . Have fun .
__pt-br__ Explore .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__pt-br__ I see this plus sign .
__pt-br__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__pt-br__ Now this is one of the images .
__pt-br__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__pt-br__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__pt-br__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__pt-br__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__pt-br__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__pt-br__ You can zoom around very simply .
__pt-br__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__pt-br__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__pt-br__ But then you really want to go deep .
__pt-br__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__pt-br__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__pt-br__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__pt-br__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__pt-br__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__pt-br__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__pt-br__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__pt-br__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__pt-br__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__pt-br__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__pt-br__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__pt-br__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__pt-br__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__pt-br__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__pt-br__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__pt-br__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__pt-br__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__pt-br__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__pt-br__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__pt-br__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__pt-br__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__pt-br__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__pt-br__ It really comes from these artists .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__pt-br__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__pt-br__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
__pt-br__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
__pt-br__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__pt-br__ I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
__pt-br__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__pt-br__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__pt-br__ Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual .
__pt-br__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
__pt-br__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
__pt-br__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
__pt-br__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__pt-br__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
__pt-br__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
__pt-br__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
__pt-br__ Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
__pt-br__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__pt-br__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
__pt-br__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__pt-br__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__pt-br__ It will dry up inside .
__pt-br__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__pt-br__ We all do .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__pt-br__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__pt-br__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
__pt-br__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__pt-br__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__pt-br__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__pt-br__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__pt-br__ In my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__pt-br__ Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__pt-br__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__pt-br__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__pt-br__ My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__pt-br__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
__pt-br__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__pt-br__ I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__pt-br__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__pt-br__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__pt-br__ And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
__pt-br__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__pt-br__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__pt-br__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__pt-br__ My mother became a diplomat .
__pt-br__ So from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__pt-br__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreigner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__pt-br__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__pt-br__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__pt-br__ The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
__pt-br__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
__pt-br__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__pt-br__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__pt-br__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__pt-br__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
__pt-br__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__pt-br__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__pt-br__ In my mid-twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__pt-br__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__pt-br__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__pt-br__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__pt-br__ There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
__pt-br__ He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
__pt-br__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
__pt-br__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__pt-br__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__pt-br__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__pt-br__ I started writing fiction in English .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__pt-br__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__pt-br__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__pt-br__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__pt-br__ When you &apos;re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__pt-br__ As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__pt-br__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__pt-br__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__pt-br__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__pt-br__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__pt-br__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__pt-br__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__pt-br__ I guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
__pt-br__ Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__pt-br__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__pt-br__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__pt-br__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__pt-br__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__pt-br__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__pt-br__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__pt-br__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__pt-br__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
__pt-br__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more heavily .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
__pt-br__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .
__pt-br__ Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__pt-br__ The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__pt-br__ When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
__pt-br__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__pt-br__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__pt-br__ It was only because of our passports .
__pt-br__ Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__pt-br__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__pt-br__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__pt-br__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__pt-br__ It comes from everywhere .
__pt-br__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
__pt-br__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__pt-br__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__pt-br__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict .
__pt-br__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__pt-br__ It was just a story .
__pt-br__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
__pt-br__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__pt-br__ Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__pt-br__ Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__pt-br__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
__pt-br__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__pt-br__ The other , in nuances .
__pt-br__ One draws boundaries .
__pt-br__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__pt-br__ Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
__pt-br__ Fiction is flowing water .
__pt-br__ In the Ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__pt-br__ With each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
__pt-br__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
__pt-br__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__pt-br__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__pt-br__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
__pt-br__ Literature has to take us beyond .
__pt-br__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__pt-br__ Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was — that I once was .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
__pt-br__ When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__pt-br__ The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__pt-br__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__pt-br__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__pt-br__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__pt-br__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__pt-br__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__pt-br__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace , which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
__pt-br__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__pt-br__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__pt-br__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
__pt-br__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__pt-br__ When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
__pt-br__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__pt-br__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__pt-br__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__pt-br__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__pt-br__ Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__pt-br__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__pt-br__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__pt-br__ Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__pt-br__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__pt-br__ We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
__pt-br__ In the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__pt-br__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__pt-br__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
__pt-br__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__pt-br__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
__pt-br__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
__pt-br__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__pt-br__ Five million people use it every month .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__pt-br__ His work is brilliant .
__pt-br__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__pt-br__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__pt-br__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
__pt-br__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__pt-br__ This is really exciting .
__pt-br__ According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__pt-br__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__pt-br__ We made this game in 2007 .
__pt-br__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
__pt-br__ The &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado , called Craig .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Rockies .
__pt-br__ And the job in question was sheep rancher .
__pt-br__ My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m an apprentice , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
__pt-br__ And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
__pt-br__ The job in question : herding sheep . Great .
__pt-br__ We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work .
__pt-br__ So , normally , I never do any research at all .
__pt-br__ But , this is a touchy subject , and I work for the Discovery Channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
__pt-br__ So I called the Humane Society and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be castrating some lambs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
__pt-br__ This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain familiarity to it .
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , tightly .
__pt-br__ And then another band is applied to the scrotum , tightly .
__pt-br__ Blood flow is slowly retarded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
__pt-br__ &quot; Great — got it . &quot;
__pt-br__ OK , I call the SPCA to confirm this — they confirm it .
__pt-br__ I also call PETA , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confirm it .
__pt-br__ OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
__pt-br__ So the next day I go out .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
__pt-br__ Melanie is the wife of Albert .
__pt-br__ Albert is the shepherd in question .
__pt-br__ Melanie picks up the lamb — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , likewise on the left .
__pt-br__ Lamb goes on the post , she opens it up .
__pt-br__ Alright . Great .
__pt-br__ Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the crew is around .
__pt-br__ I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
__pt-br__ Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
__pt-br__ Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
__pt-br__ And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies , it was very — it was , it was impressive .
__pt-br__ In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail , right next to the butt of the lamb , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding .
__pt-br__ A second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
__pt-br__ And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
__pt-br__ Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
__pt-br__ He snips it , throws the tip over his shoulder , and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward , and then his head dips down , obscuring my view , but what I hear is a slurping sound , and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding .
__pt-br__ Can we roll the video ?
__pt-br__ No I &apos;m kidding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
__pt-br__ So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
__pt-br__ I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scripting , there &apos;s no nonsense .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse — we shoot what we get !
__pt-br__ I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
__pt-br__ We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are testicles in this bucket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Humane Society ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Humane Society .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lamb squeal and bleed — we &apos;re on in five continents , dude .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re on twice a day on the Discovery Channel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
__pt-br__ Melanie picks up another lamb , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scrotum .
__pt-br__ Lamb goes on the ground , lamb takes two steps , falls down , gets up , shakes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lamb , at all .
__pt-br__ Gets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s quivering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distress .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m looking at the lamb and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
__pt-br__ When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
__pt-br__ Meanwhile , the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is , you know , he &apos;s just prancing around , bleeding stopped .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
__pt-br__ And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was , in that second .
__pt-br__ And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am , so much of the time .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German porno , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Melanie picks up the lamb , puts it on the post , opens it up .
__pt-br__ Albert hands me the knife .
__pt-br__ I go in , tail comes off .
__pt-br__ I go in , I grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
__pt-br__ Albert instructs , &quot; &quot; Push it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
__pt-br__ &quot; Push it further . &quot;
__pt-br__ I do .
__pt-br__ The testicles emerge — they look like thumbs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; Bite &apos; em .
__pt-br__ Just bite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
__pt-br__ How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Rockies , and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy .
__pt-br__ You know , Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jacked-up metaphor ?
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
__pt-br__ I went in and I took them .
__pt-br__ I took them like this , and I yanked my face back .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m standing there with two testicles on my chin .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
__pt-br__ OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Poetics , &quot; &quot; in Aristotle , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crashing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .
__pt-br__ And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__pt-br__ Anagnorisis and peripeteia .
__pt-br__ Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .
__pt-br__ Literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; is .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m up to my neck in anagnorises every single day .
__pt-br__ Great .
__pt-br__ The other word , peripeteia , that &apos;s the moment in the great tragedies , you know — Euripides and Sophocles — the moment where Oedipus has his moment , where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
__pt-br__ And this metaphor in my head — I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
__pt-br__ When you start to look for peripetia , you find it everywhere .
__pt-br__ I mean , Bruce Willis in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense , &quot; &quot; right ?
__pt-br__ Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peripetia .
__pt-br__ You know ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s crushing when the audience sees it the right way .
__pt-br__ Neo in &quot; &quot; The Matrix , &quot; &quot; you know ?
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
__pt-br__ These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
__pt-br__ And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled — but it looked OK .
__pt-br__ Looking at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a literal way , what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?
__pt-br__ Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is .
__pt-br__ And I talk to him .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
__pt-br__ Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye , dribbling down her chin , with the steel workers .
__pt-br__ I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collectively , it might be time to think about it .
__pt-br__ Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , testicles are on my chin , thoughts are bouncing around .
__pt-br__ And , after that shoot , Dirty Jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
__pt-br__ And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
__pt-br__ I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other notions of work that I &apos;ve just been assuming are sacrosanct , and they &apos;re not .
__pt-br__ People with dirty jobs are happier than you think .
__pt-br__ As a group , they &apos;re the happiest people I know .
__pt-br__ And I don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union Label , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work .
__pt-br__ Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work . I swear to God — I did it with them .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
__pt-br__ And I see it over and over and over again .
__pt-br__ So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows .
__pt-br__ Follow your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
__pt-br__ Follow your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
__pt-br__ Probably the worst advice I ever got .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
__pt-br__ I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
__pt-br__ I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob Combs , the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine .
__pt-br__ Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he spends his days doing this incredible service , and he smells like hell , but God bless him .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s making a great living .
__pt-br__ You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
__pt-br__ The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of Vegas .
__pt-br__ He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
__pt-br__ He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
__pt-br__ And I hear that story over and over .
__pt-br__ Matt Froind , a dairy farmer in New Canaan , Connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
__pt-br__ Now , he &apos;s selling them to Walmart .
__pt-br__ Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
__pt-br__ So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
__pt-br__ I started to look at teamwork and determination , and basically all those platitudes they call &quot; &quot; successories &quot; &quot; that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now .
__pt-br__ That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
__pt-br__ Safety — safety first ?
__pt-br__ Going back to , you know , OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society : what if OSHA got it wrong ?
__pt-br__ I mean — this is heresy , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
__pt-br__ Right ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
__pt-br__ What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
__pt-br__ They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the Bering Sea , I was on a crab boat with the &quot; &quot; Deadliest Catch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 50-foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheelhouse , right ?
__pt-br__ Most hazardous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , lashing the pots down .
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
__pt-br__ Unspeakably dangerous .
__pt-br__ I scamper down , I go into the wheelhouse and I say , with some level of incredulity , &quot; Captain , OSHA . &quot;
__pt-br__ And he says , &quot; &quot; OSHA ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repeated in the lower 48 .
__pt-br__ It can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
__pt-br__ But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
__pt-br__ My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
__pt-br__ My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
__pt-br__ And for the rest of that day , safety first .
__pt-br__ I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice versa .
__pt-br__ Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
__pt-br__ I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong .
__pt-br__ But , what it all comes down to is this .
__pt-br__ I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
__pt-br__ It goes like this — we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a civil war .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a cold war , really .
__pt-br__ We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way , but we &apos;ve done it .
__pt-br__ And we &apos;ve waged this war on at least four fronts , certainly in Hollywood .
__pt-br__ The way we portray working people on TV — it &apos;s laughable .
__pt-br__ If there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . Admit it .
__pt-br__ You see him all the time .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what plumbers look like , right ?
__pt-br__ We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into punch lines .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what TV does .
__pt-br__ We try hard on &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t cheat .
__pt-br__ But , we &apos;ve waged this war on Madison Avenue .
__pt-br__ I mean , so many of the commercials that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
__pt-br__ Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could retire a little faster , if you could punch out a little sooner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
__pt-br__ Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
__pt-br__ I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
__pt-br__ And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
__pt-br__ How many people have their Blackberries ?
__pt-br__ We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
__pt-br__ I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
__pt-br__ Good grief , not to this crowd .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .
__pt-br__ And nobody celebrates imitation the way &quot; &quot; Dirty Jobs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
__pt-br__ Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circuitry , the same board , over and over ?
__pt-br__ All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
__pt-br__ So , we &apos;ve got this new toolbox , you know .
__pt-br__ Our tools today don &apos;t look like shovels and picks .
__pt-br__ They look like the stuff we walk around with .
__pt-br__ And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs .
__pt-br__ And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
__pt-br__ And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
__pt-br__ I got a lot wrong .
__pt-br__ So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manual labor , skilled labor .
__pt-br__ Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
__pt-br__ Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
__pt-br__ The infrastructure is a huge deal .
__pt-br__ This war on work , that I suppose exists , has casualties like any other war .
__pt-br__ The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one .
__pt-br__ Every single year : fewer electricians , fewer carpenters , fewer plumbers , fewer welders , fewer pipefitters , fewer steamfitters .
__pt-br__ The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
__pt-br__ Meanwhile , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers — that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently rated at a D minus .
__pt-br__ So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
__pt-br__ And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t opposites .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and imitation , like risk and responsibility , like peripetia and anagnorisis , like that poor little lamb , who I hope isn &apos;t quivering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__pt-br__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__pt-br__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__pt-br__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__pt-br__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__pt-br__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__pt-br__ So a high I.Q.
__pt-br__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__pt-br__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__pt-br__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
__pt-br__ And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
__pt-br__ Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
__pt-br__ It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
__pt-br__ And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
__pt-br__ OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
__pt-br__ I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
__pt-br__ How does this happen ?
__pt-br__ Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
__pt-br__ One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
__pt-br__ What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
__pt-br__ What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
__pt-br__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__pt-br__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__pt-br__ So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
__pt-br__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__pt-br__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__pt-br__ If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
__pt-br__ And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
__pt-br__ You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
__pt-br__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__pt-br__ I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
__pt-br__ OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
__pt-br__ This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
__pt-br__ She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
__pt-br__ Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
__pt-br__ Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
__pt-br__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__pt-br__ This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Freudian view .
__pt-br__ And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
__pt-br__ Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
__pt-br__ And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
__pt-br__ And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
__pt-br__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__pt-br__ This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Freudian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__pt-br__ Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__pt-br__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__pt-br__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__pt-br__ Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
__pt-br__ There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
__pt-br__ There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
__pt-br__ You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
__pt-br__ I talked about that earlier .
__pt-br__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__pt-br__ But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
__pt-br__ Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
__pt-br__ Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?
__pt-br__ Which you can completely ignore .
__pt-br__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
__pt-br__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__pt-br__ You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
__pt-br__ So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
__pt-br__ So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
__pt-br__ And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
__pt-br__ But maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
__pt-br__ So because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?
__pt-br__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
__pt-br__ Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
__pt-br__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
__pt-br__ And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
__pt-br__ You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
__pt-br__ You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
__pt-br__ Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
__pt-br__ So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
__pt-br__ By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
__pt-br__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__pt-br__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__pt-br__ The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
__pt-br__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__pt-br__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
__pt-br__ OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
__pt-br__ Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
__pt-br__ And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
__pt-br__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__pt-br__ When an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
__pt-br__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__pt-br__ Believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
__pt-br__ And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that .
__pt-br__ OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
__pt-br__ One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
__pt-br__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__pt-br__ These are very compelling , vivid sensations .
__pt-br__ The patient &apos;s not delusional .
__pt-br__ He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
__pt-br__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__pt-br__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
__pt-br__ If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
__pt-br__ It sounds like an oxymoron .
__pt-br__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__pt-br__ The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
__pt-br__ So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
__pt-br__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__pt-br__ Patients become depressed .
__pt-br__ Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
__pt-br__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__pt-br__ Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
__pt-br__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__pt-br__ Why does this happen ?
__pt-br__ When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
__pt-br__ And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
__pt-br__ The brain learns , because of this Hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
__pt-br__ And then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?
__pt-br__ Now , how do you help these patients ?
__pt-br__ How do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
__pt-br__ Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
__pt-br__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
__pt-br__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__pt-br__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__pt-br__ So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
__pt-br__ You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
__pt-br__ He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
__pt-br__ He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
__pt-br__ He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__pt-br__ It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
__pt-br__ So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
__pt-br__ And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
__pt-br__ He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
__pt-br__ That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started giggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
__pt-br__ He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
__pt-br__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__pt-br__ And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__pt-br__ And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes .
__pt-br__ &quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__pt-br__ So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
__pt-br__ So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
__pt-br__ So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
__pt-br__ Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
__pt-br__ I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
__pt-br__ But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
__pt-br__ Now , why does this happen ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
__pt-br__ On the other hand , there &apos;s no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
__pt-br__ And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
__pt-br__ It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
__pt-br__ And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
__pt-br__ So , that &apos;s the bonus .
__pt-br__ Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
__pt-br__ Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
__pt-br__ But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
__pt-br__ This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
__pt-br__ OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
__pt-br__ This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
__pt-br__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__pt-br__ He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
__pt-br__ Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ?
__pt-br__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__pt-br__ Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
__pt-br__ C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
__pt-br__ Why does this happen ?
__pt-br__ This is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
__pt-br__ In us , all the senses are distinct .
__pt-br__ These people muddle up their senses .
__pt-br__ Why does this happen ?
__pt-br__ One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
__pt-br__ Synesthesia runs in families , so Galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
__pt-br__ Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
__pt-br__ Why would that be ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to answer that question .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s never been answered before .
__pt-br__ OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
__pt-br__ Well , there are many theories .
__pt-br__ One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
__pt-br__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__pt-br__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
__pt-br__ Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?
__pt-br__ So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
__pt-br__ So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
__pt-br__ So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia .
__pt-br__ Now remember — why does this happen ?
__pt-br__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__pt-br__ Remember I said it runs in families ?
__pt-br__ That gives you the clue .
__pt-br__ And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
__pt-br__ In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
__pt-br__ So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
__pt-br__ So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
__pt-br__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
__pt-br__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
__pt-br__ So far , so good .
__pt-br__ Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
__pt-br__ Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?
__pt-br__ I mean , schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
__pt-br__ Normal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun .
__pt-br__ Instantly , you &apos;ve found the links .
__pt-br__ Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
__pt-br__ And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
__pt-br__ OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
__pt-br__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetes , but you &apos;re in denial about it .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
__pt-br__ Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
__pt-br__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__pt-br__ One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
__pt-br__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__pt-br__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__pt-br__ Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands .
__pt-br__ Ninety-nine percent of you .
__pt-br__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
__pt-br__ Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
__pt-br__ If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glitters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
__pt-br__ You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
__pt-br__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__pt-br__ Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
__pt-br__ And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
__pt-br__ All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Sorry about that .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__pt-br__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
__pt-br__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
__pt-br__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__pt-br__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__pt-br__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__pt-br__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__pt-br__ Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
__pt-br__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__pt-br__ I had to do something .
__pt-br__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__pt-br__ So I tried bronze casting .
__pt-br__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__pt-br__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
__pt-br__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
__pt-br__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__pt-br__ I was mesmerized .
__pt-br__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
__pt-br__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__pt-br__ Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
__pt-br__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
__pt-br__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__pt-br__ Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__pt-br__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
__pt-br__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__pt-br__ So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
__pt-br__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__pt-br__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__pt-br__ I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
__pt-br__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__pt-br__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__pt-br__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
__pt-br__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
__pt-br__ So we had to create one .
__pt-br__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
__pt-br__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
__pt-br__ Now it had a sense of place .
__pt-br__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__pt-br__ As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__pt-br__ My life was not going to be the same .
__pt-br__ I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__pt-br__ Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
__pt-br__ So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__pt-br__ Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__pt-br__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__pt-br__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
__pt-br__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__pt-br__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
__pt-br__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__pt-br__ Its shape was too complex now .
__pt-br__ So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__pt-br__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__pt-br__ There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__pt-br__ So we had to create it .
__pt-br__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__pt-br__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__pt-br__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__pt-br__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__pt-br__ Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
__pt-br__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__pt-br__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__pt-br__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__pt-br__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__pt-br__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__pt-br__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ So when I was a kid ...
__pt-br__ So it makes sense that we &apos;ve headed in this direction .
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
__pt-br__ Well , this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests .
__pt-br__ There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut .
__pt-br__ The industry has , to its credit , greatly improved .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s growing at something like seven percent per year .
__pt-br__ The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re also extremely fuel efficient .
__pt-br__ In fact , that &apos;s where omega-3s come from , they don &apos;t come from fish .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__pt-br__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__pt-br__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__pt-br__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__pt-br__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__pt-br__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__pt-br__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__pt-br__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__pt-br__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__pt-br__ And I felt lighter in my body .
