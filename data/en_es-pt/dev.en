__es__ When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
__es__ My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
__es__ There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
__es__ &quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
__es__ I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
__es__ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
__es__ A morning that I will never forget .
__es__ A real school .
__es__ You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
__es__ So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
__es__ It was the only way we both could be educated .
__es__ Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
__es__ We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
__es__ The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
__es__ It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
__es__ We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
__es__ From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
__es__ We always wondered what they knew about us .
__es__ Were we being followed ?
__es__ Do they know where we live ?
__es__ We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
__es__ I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
__es__ My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
__es__ A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
__es__ But my educated mother became a teacher .
__es__ There she is .
__es__ She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
__es__ And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
__es__ There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
__es__ To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
__es__ During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
__es__ I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
__es__ Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
__es__ But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
__es__ So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
__es__ I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
__es__ Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
__es__ Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
__es__ ( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
__es__ He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
__es__ ( Applause ) My family believes in me .
__es__ I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
__es__ That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
__es__ That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
__es__ The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
__es__ And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
__es__ Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
__es__ Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
__es__ As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
__es__ It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
__es__ In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
__es__ Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
__es__ But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
__es__ ( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
__es__ I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
__es__ I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
__es__ But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
__es__ To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
__es__ Like me , they are dreaming big .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ And you &apos;ll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
__es__ And slightly more complex things appear .
__es__ That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
__es__ And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
__es__ But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
__es__ Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
__es__ Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
__es__ We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
__es__ What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
__es__ How old are you ? What do you do ?
__es__ Then we get more personal with it .
__es__ Have you ever had any diseases ?
__es__ Have you ever been divorced ?
__es__ Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
__es__ What are you into ? Who are you into ?
__es__ What gender do you like to sleep with ?
__es__ I get it .
__es__ We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
__es__ We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
__es__ We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
__es__ We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
__es__ Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
__es__ Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
__es__ The boxes are too narrow .
__es__ And this can get really dangerous .
__es__ So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
__es__ I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
__es__ I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
__es__ I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
__es__ Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
__es__ ( Laughter ) It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
__es__ So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
__es__ I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
__es__ They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
__es__ So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
__es__ When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
__es__ I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
__es__ I kept up the charade for eight years .
__es__ So this is me when I was 11 .
__es__ I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
__es__ See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
__es__ In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
__es__ Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
__es__ When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
__es__ At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
__es__ It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
__es__ I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
__es__ I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
__es__ I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
__es__ If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
__es__ But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
__es__ Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
__es__ When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
__es__ No one is exactly shocked .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
__es__ When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
__es__ Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
__es__ See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
__es__ I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
__es__ So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
__es__ And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
__es__ But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
__es__ And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
__es__ And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
__es__ If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
__es__ At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
__es__ I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines — girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
__es__ I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
__es__ And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
__es__ I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
__es__ I was not an activist .
__es__ I wave no flags in my own life .
__es__ But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
__es__ How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
__es__ Were we even a group ? What group ?
__es__ And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
__es__ Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
__es__ And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
__es__ It might give them pause .
__es__ Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
__es__ Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
__es__ For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
__es__ Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
__es__ So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
__es__ And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
__es__ So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
__es__ And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
__es__ And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
__es__ And then we made this .
__es__ ( Music ) Video : I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
__es__ Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
__es__ My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
__es__ My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
__es__ ( Music ) &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
__es__ It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
__es__ We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
__es__ There is no equality in the United States .
__es__ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Marriage &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Freedom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
__es__ The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
__es__ Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
__es__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
__es__ So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
__es__ And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
__es__ I want to take the project across the country .
__es__ I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
__es__ This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
__es__ I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
__es__ ( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Self evident truths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) iO Tillett Wright : Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
__es__ Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
__es__ And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
__es__ So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
__es__ That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
__es__ I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
__es__ Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
__es__ So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
__es__ Visibility really is key .
__es__ Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
__es__ Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
__es__ Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
__es__ Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
__es__ But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
__es__ In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
__es__ It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
__es__ It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
__es__ At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; gays &quot; &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
__es__ Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
__es__ At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
__es__ And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
__es__ ( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
__es__ Can you quantify your openness ?
__es__ Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
__es__ Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
__es__ I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; &quot; Grey . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
__es__ And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
__es__ I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
__es__ ( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
__es__ The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
__es__ And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
__es__ Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
__es__ Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
__es__ Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
__es__ Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
__es__ Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
__es__ After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
__es__ Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
__es__ So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
__es__ Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
__es__ Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
__es__ What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
__es__ And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
__es__ At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
__es__ So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
__es__ Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
__es__ It &apos;s too late .
__es__ Because I already am all of those things .
__es__ We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
__es__ So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
__es__ The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
__es__ I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
__es__ I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
__es__ Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
__es__ When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
__es__ As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
__es__ I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
__es__ For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
__es__ Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
__es__ We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
__es__ After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
__es__ It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
__es__ Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
__es__ Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
__es__ Some I even considered like my second home .
__es__ But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
__es__ A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
__es__ That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
__es__ A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
__es__ That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
__es__ Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
__es__ Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
__es__ Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
__es__ Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
__es__ Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
__es__ In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
__es__ This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
__es__ Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
__es__ Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
__es__ There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
__es__ So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
__es__ Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
__es__ Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
__es__ I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
__es__ I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
__es__ I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
__es__ I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
__es__ I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
__es__ As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
__es__ In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
__es__ The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
__es__ It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
__es__ How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
__es__ Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
__es__ They have nothing to compare it to .
__es__ When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
__es__ I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
__es__ Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
__es__ In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
__es__ They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
__es__ This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
__es__ It was more like a restaurant .
__es__ Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
__es__ Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
__es__ Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
__es__ The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
__es__ Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
__es__ I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
__es__ There were no back doors .
__es__ There were no windows large enough to climb through .
__es__ These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
__es__ Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
__es__ Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
__es__ It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
__es__ The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
__es__ I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
__es__ This is a family portrait .
__es__ The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
__es__ They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
__es__ My interpreter told me their stories .
__es__ &quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
__es__ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
__es__ When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
__es__ I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
__es__ Wrong . They were all enslaved .
__es__ Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
__es__ This young child is eight years old .
__es__ He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
__es__ He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
__es__ The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
__es__ Many of them drown .
__es__ For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
__es__ Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
__es__ I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
__es__ in the cold , windy night .
__es__ And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
__es__ I want to introduce you to Kofi .
__es__ Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
__es__ I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
__es__ Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
__es__ Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
__es__ Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
__es__ Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
__es__ He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
__es__ At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
__es__ Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
__es__ After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
__es__ Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
__es__ Mercury is used in the extraction process .
__es__ These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
__es__ When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
__es__ I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
__es__ The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
__es__ At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
__es__ All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
__es__ In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
__es__ This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
__es__ When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
__es__ When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
__es__ On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
__es__ Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
__es__ I want to shine a light on slavery .
__es__ When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
__es__ They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
__es__ I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
__es__ I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
__es__ These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
__es__ There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
__es__ I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
__es__ Thank you very much .

__es__ The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
__es__ But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
__es__ Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
__es__ So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
__es__ These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
__es__ In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban .
__es__ And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
__es__ And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
__es__ Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
__es__ At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
__es__ So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
__es__ We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
__es__ This is our group , our main group of weavers .
__es__ They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
__es__ They all have bank accounts .
__es__ They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
__es__ It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
__es__ This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
__es__ And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
__es__ And the rest says it all .
__es__ Thank you very much .

__es__ In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
__es__ If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
__es__ Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
__es__ Here &apos;s my clock .
__es__ It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
__es__ Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
__es__ So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
__es__ At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
__es__ Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
__es__ So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
__es__ However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__es__ It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
__es__ In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
__es__ In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
__es__ This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
__es__ So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
__es__ Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
__es__ You can see why I hate Chris .
__es__ One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
__es__ This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
__es__ All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
__es__ Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
__es__ And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
__es__ So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
__es__ To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
__es__ Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
__es__ Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
__es__ Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
__es__ Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
__es__ ( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
__es__ So here are some other results .
__es__ The first is for instant noodles .
__es__ Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
__es__ You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
__es__ OK , next , clubbing .
__es__ These people I still do hang out with .
__es__ All right , and smoking .
__es__ Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
__es__ OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
__es__ It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
__es__ Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
__es__ In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
__es__ That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
__es__ Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
__es__ So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
__es__ Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
__es__ And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
__es__ You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
__es__ Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__es__ It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
__es__ In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
__es__ And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
__es__ You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
__es__ Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
__es__ So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
__es__ Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
__es__ We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
__es__ So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
__es__ Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
__es__ It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
__es__ Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
__es__ Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
__es__ Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
__es__ There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
__es__ Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
__es__ Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
__es__ Oh , one last thing before I leave .
__es__ And the best way to do that is with free candy .
__es__ You guys ready ?
__es__ All right .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
__es__ So I guess I was the lucky one .
__es__ My mother had 16 pregnancies .
__es__ From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
__es__ You can imagine as a child what I went through .
__es__ Day to day , I watched women being carried to a graveyard , or watched children going to a graveyard .
__es__ At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
__es__ I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
__es__ So I completed my education , but I wanted to go to university .
__es__ Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dormitory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
__es__ So as a result , my father sent me to America .
__es__ I came to America .
__es__ I completed my education .
__es__ While I was completing my education , my country was invaded by Russia .
__es__ And do you know that at the time I was completing my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
__es__ There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
__es__ My family was in a refugee camp .
__es__ So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
__es__ I wanted them to be safe .
__es__ But where was my heart ?
__es__ My heart was in Afghanistan .
__es__ I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
__es__ I had a good job .
__es__ I was a professor at a university .
__es__ I earned good money .
__es__ I had a good life .
__es__ My family was here .
__es__ I could live with them .
__es__ But I wasn &apos;t happy .
__es__ I wanted to go back home .
__es__ So I went to the refugee camp .
__es__ And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan , there were 7.5 million refugees . 7.5 million refugees .
__es__ About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
__es__ when I went day-to-day to do a survey , I found things you never could imagine .
__es__ I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do .
__es__ I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
__es__ I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
__es__ So it was a very devastating situation .
__es__ My heart was beating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
__es__ At that moment , we talk about momentum .
__es__ At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
__es__ How could I help these people ?
__es__ I am one individual . What can I do for them ?
__es__ But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
__es__ It transformed me . It gave me status .
__es__ It gave me confidence . It gave me a career .
__es__ And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
__es__ But do you think it was easy ?
__es__ No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
__es__ And also , by Russia invading Afghanistan , people were not trusting anyone .
__es__ It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
__es__ Somebody who comes from the United States .
__es__ Somebody who got educated here .
__es__ Did they trust me ? Of course not .
__es__ So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
__es__ How am I going to do that ?
__es__ I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
__es__ I asked .
__es__ Finally , I found one man .
__es__ He was 80 years old .
__es__ He was a mullah .
__es__ I went to his tent in the camp , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
__es__ And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Crazy woman , crazy woman , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his compound , the word spread all over .
__es__ In a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
__es__ But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
__es__ one day I was in the office in Peshawar , Pakistan .
__es__ All of a sudden , I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , &quot; &quot; Run away , hide ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
__es__ You &apos;re scared . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
__es__ You know your life is on the line .
__es__ But as a leader , you have to hold it together .
__es__ You have to hold it together and show strength .
__es__ So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
__es__ So I invited them to the office .
__es__ They came , and there were nine of them — nine Taliban .
__es__ They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Very mean-looking people , black clothes , black turban , and they pour into my office .
__es__ And I invited them to have a seat and have tea .
__es__ They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
__es__ And of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very scary , but I was really shaking up .
__es__ But also I was strong , holding myself up .
__es__ And , of course , by that time , you know how I dress — I dress from head to toe in a black hijab .
__es__ The only thing you could see , my eyes .
__es__ They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
__es__ Don &apos;t you know that school is banned for girls ?
__es__ What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
__es__ We have some students coming , and they are all learning Koran , Holy Book .
__es__ And you know , Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obey their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking Pashto .
__es__ They talked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I offered them tea again , and they took a sip and they left .
__es__ By that time , my staff poured into my office .
__es__ They were scared to death .
__es__ They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
__es__ They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
__es__ But everybody was happy to see me .
__es__ Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Of course , I was happy to be alive .
__es__ But also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban — of course during the Taliban there is another story .
__es__ We went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls , 3,000 students underground , and continuously we trained .
__es__ With the fall of the Taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
__es__ We opened women &apos;s learning center .
__es__ We continuously opened clinics .
__es__ We worked with mothers and children .
__es__ We had reproductive health training .
__es__ I was very happy . I was delighted with the outcome of my work .
__es__ And one day , with four trainers and one bodyguard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
__es__ Rifles on their shoulders , they blocked the road .
__es__ And I told my driver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the driver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bodyguard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
__es__ What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
__es__ I am very shaken up , and I told myself , this is it .
__es__ This time , we all are going to be killed .
__es__ There is no doubt in my mind .
__es__ But still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
__es__ It &apos;s in your heart .
__es__ You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
__es__ So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
__es__ My leg was shaking , and I got outside .
__es__ And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
__es__ They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
__es__ We know where you are going .
__es__ Every day you go up north here and there .
__es__ You train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
__es__ You build their skills . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
__es__ What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK .
__es__ The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gun and kill .
__es__ That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
__es__ It &apos;s a trap to me , of course .
__es__ So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I walked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the driver , &quot; &quot; Turn around and go back to the office . &quot; &quot; At that time , we only were supporting girls .
__es__ We only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
__es__ By the time I came to the office , of course my trainers were gone .
__es__ They ran away home . Nobody stayed there .
__es__ My bodyguard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
__es__ I was shaken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
__es__ Because we had training going on up north already .
__es__ Hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
__es__ So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
__es__ And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; And I answered her .
__es__ She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I tried to cover .
__es__ No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
__es__ &quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
__es__ I told her the whole story .
__es__ At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
__es__ You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same route , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car .
__es__ So we stopped the car .
__es__ I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
__es__ So I took them to the mosque , and to make a long story short , I told them I &apos;d give them teachers .
__es__ Today , they are the best trainers .
__es__ They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my guides .
__es__ Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . They are ahead , and we go .
__es__ And they protect us .
__es__ And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ That tells you that education transforms people .
__es__ When you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
__es__ We cannot only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
__es__ So we are continuously giving training to men , and I really believe strongly .
__es__ I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
__es__ I just want to share this with you .
__es__ It was a beautiful country , beautiful , peaceful country .
__es__ We were going everywhere .
__es__ Women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
__es__ We never locked our doors .
__es__ But you know what happened to my country .
__es__ Today , people cannot walk out of their door without security issues .
__es__ But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
__es__ And I want to tell you the other side .
__es__ Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
__es__ They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
__es__ They are training to be doctors , back again .
__es__ So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
__es__ I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of trust and honesty .
__es__ If you have these few things with you , you will accomplish .
__es__ We have one poet , Mawlānā Rūmī .
__es__ He said that by having compassion and having love , you can conquer the world .
__es__ And I tell you , we could .
__es__ And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
__es__ Thank you very , very much .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__es__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__es__ Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
__es__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__es__ They kill our livestock .
__es__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__es__ My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__es__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__es__ The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__es__ So they kill the lions .
__es__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__es__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__es__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__es__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__es__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__es__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
__es__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__es__ And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
__es__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
__es__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__es__ So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__es__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__es__ So I had an idea .
__es__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
__es__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__es__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__es__ So I set up everything .
__es__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
__es__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__es__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__es__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__es__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__es__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__es__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__es__ One of them was this grandmother .
__es__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__es__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__es__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__es__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__es__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__es__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__es__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__es__ And here I am today .
__es__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__es__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__es__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__es__ Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__es__ So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
__es__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__es__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__es__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
__es__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__es__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
__es__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
__es__ Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )

__es__ ( Applause ) Maya Penn : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon , and I &apos;ve been making animated flip books since I was three years old .
__es__ At that age , I also learned about what an animator was .
__es__ There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
__es__ When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a greatly defining moment in my life .
__es__ Animation and art has always been my first love .
__es__ It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
__es__ Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things ?
__es__ And thus , &quot; &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; &quot; was born .
__es__ At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
__es__ That started my love for technology .
__es__ I built my first website myself in HTML , and I &apos;m learning JavaScript and Python .
__es__ I &apos;m also working on an animated series called &quot; &quot; The Pollinators . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
__es__ If plants aren &apos;t pollinated by the pollinators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would starve .
__es__ So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team .
__es__ ( Applause ) ( Foot stomp ) ( Music ) ( Roar ) Pollinator : Deforestsaurus ! I should have known !
__es__ I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators !
__es__ ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my animations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
__es__ Ideas can spark a movement .
__es__ Ideas are opportunities and innovation .
__es__ Ideas truly are what make the world go round .
__es__ If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
__es__ At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya &apos;s Ideas , and my nonprofit , Maya &apos;s Ideas for the Planet .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
__es__ I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
__es__ I was greatly influenced by art , and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did , even my business .
__es__ I would find different fabrics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scarf or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for designs .
__es__ I noticed when I wore my creations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
__es__ And I thought , I can start my own business .
__es__ Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
__es__ I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
__es__ I started making more items like hats , scarves and bags .
__es__ Soon , my items began selling all over the world , and I had customers in Denmark , Italy , Australia , Canada and more .
__es__ Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
__es__ Soon , my business really started to take off .
__es__ Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
__es__ ( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
__es__ Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
__es__ I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
__es__ My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
__es__ I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
__es__ For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
__es__ These actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it .
__es__ ( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
__es__ I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
__es__ We live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
__es__ But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
__es__ It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
__es__ That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
__es__ Thank you , and peace and blessings .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : So , you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
__es__ Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just — Ah !
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
__es__ Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
__es__ And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
__es__ We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
__es__ We go through initiation rites .
__es__ We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
__es__ But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
__es__ And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
__es__ All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
__es__ And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
__es__ Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
__es__ And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
__es__ The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
__es__ It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
__es__ And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
__es__ No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
__es__ And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
__es__ When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
__es__ Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
__es__ A language is a flash of the human spirit .
__es__ It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
__es__ Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
__es__ And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
__es__ They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
__es__ What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
__es__ And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
__es__ And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
__es__ Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
__es__ And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
__es__ Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
__es__ Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
__es__ Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
__es__ They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
__es__ And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
__es__ They simply listen and then begin to speak .
__es__ Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
__es__ In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
__es__ They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
__es__ They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
__es__ But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
__es__ They speared each other .
__es__ 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
__es__ We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
__es__ Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
__es__ In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
__es__ In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
__es__ On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
__es__ It &apos;s interesting .
__es__ If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
__es__ Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
__es__ There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
__es__ But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
__es__ So , the living give birth to the spirits .
__es__ The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
__es__ That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
__es__ We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?
__es__ So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
__es__ Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
__es__ Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
__es__ In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
__es__ To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
__es__ The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
__es__ And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
__es__ And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
__es__ It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
__es__ Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
__es__ Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
__es__ Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
__es__ There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
__es__ Now , what does that mean ?
__es__ It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
__es__ Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
__es__ What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
__es__ I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
__es__ That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
__es__ Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
__es__ It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
__es__ This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
__es__ What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
__es__ This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__es__ If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__es__ To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
__es__ In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes — who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
__es__ They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
__es__ Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
__es__ How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
__es__ Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
__es__ But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
__es__ This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
__es__ And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
__es__ I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
__es__ Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
__es__ Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
__es__ All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
__es__ And the problem is not technology itself .
__es__ The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
__es__ It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
__es__ Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
__es__ to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
__es__ Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
__es__ You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
__es__ And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
__es__ I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
__es__ This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
__es__ That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
__es__ His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
__es__ His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
__es__ He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
__es__ The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
__es__ One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
__es__ The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
__es__ And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
__es__ Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
__es__ And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
__es__ The Neolithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago .
__es__ The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
__es__ Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
__es__ When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
__es__ And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
__es__ This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
__es__ The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
__es__ This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
__es__ The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
__es__ Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
__es__ The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
__es__ So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
__es__ He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
__es__ He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
__es__ He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
__es__ Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
__es__ The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
__es__ It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
__es__ It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
__es__ An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
__es__ And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
__es__ They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
__es__ They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
__es__ So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
__es__ We think that polemics — ( Applause ) — we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
__es__ 156 nations carry our television channel .
__es__ Our magazines are read by millions .
__es__ And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__es__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__es__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
__es__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__es__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__es__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__es__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__es__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__es__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__es__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__es__ This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
__es__ We made this kindergarten to be a circle .
__es__ It &apos;s a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
__es__ If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
__es__ This is how the rooftop looks .
__es__ And why did we design this ?
__es__ The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a handrail . &quot;
__es__ I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
__es__ So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a handrail . &quot;
__es__ But we could keep that idea around the trees .
__es__ There are three trees popping through .
__es__ And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
__es__ But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
__es__ They fall into the net .
__es__ And you get more , and more , more .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
__es__ The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
__es__ It looks so nice from underneath .
__es__ Monkeys in the zoo .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Feeding time .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
__es__ And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
__es__ And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
__es__ You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
__es__ But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he &apos;s putting water into his boots .
__es__ ( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
__es__ And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
__es__ So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
__es__ And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
__es__ So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
__es__ When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
__es__ But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
__es__ Because there is no boundary .
__es__ And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
__es__ He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
__es__ But here , just they leave and come back .
__es__ It &apos;s a natural process .
__es__ And secondly , we consider noise very important .
__es__ You know that children sleep better in noise .
__es__ They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
__es__ And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
__es__ And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
__es__ They need noise .
__es__ And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
__es__ You are not supposed to be in silence .
__es__ And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
__es__ You know , it &apos;s completely open .
__es__ And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
__es__ In summer you go swimming .
__es__ The sand is 50 degrees .
__es__ And also , you should know that you are waterproof .
__es__ You never melt in rain .
__es__ So , children are supposed to be outside .
__es__ So that is how we should treat them .
__es__ This is how they divide classrooms .
__es__ They are supposed to help teachers .
__es__ They don &apos;t .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
__es__ A classroom .
__es__ And a washbasin .
__es__ They talk to each other around the well .
__es__ And there are always some trees in the classroom .
__es__ A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
__es__ And each classroom has at least one skylight .
__es__ And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
__es__ This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
__es__ The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
__es__ And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
__es__ So you have to consider safety .
__es__ So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
__es__ They tried to go in .
__es__ He hit his head .
__es__ He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
__es__ He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
__es__ And then we put other children .
__es__ The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo , as you know .
__es__ ( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
__es__ Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
__es__ And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
__es__ This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
__es__ Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
__es__ And the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
__es__ So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
__es__ And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
__es__ But the surprise is yet to come .
__es__ The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
__es__ And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
__es__ The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
__es__ Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
__es__ My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
__es__ They need to get some injury .
__es__ And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
__es__ I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
__es__ And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m a little bit lost , and it &apos;s finally time to make a real connection .
__es__ Who am I ?
__es__ ( Drums ) I &apos;m a single white male , 45 years of age .
__es__ I love animals .
__es__ Gainfully employed .
__es__ I &apos;m a people person .
__es__ I keep fit .
__es__ Who am I looking for ?
__es__ I &apos;m looking for my idea mate .
__es__ Are you that idea that matches with who I really am ?
__es__ ( Video ) Ron Finley : How would you feel if you had no access to healthy food ?
__es__ Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do .
__es__ RW : I love words , too — just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer .
__es__ Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
__es__ IBI : Remember — you &apos;re on a date with my idea , not me .
__es__ JM : An epic win is an outcome so extraordinarily positive , you didn &apos;t even know it was possible until you achieved it .
__es__ You &apos;re not making the face .
__es__ You &apos;re making the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not good at life &quot; &quot; face .
__es__ That &apos;s the situation .
__es__ Because without a decision we &apos;re left powerless .
__es__ 971 ?
__es__ IBI : Bonobos ! ( Laughs ) Bonobos .
__es__ RWatts : Um , interested much ?
__es__ RW : I want to have your idea baby .
__es__ RWatts : Well , you know what they say in Russia .
__es__ Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
__es__ At the time , I was cardiologist at UCLA , specializing in cardiac imaging techniques .
__es__ They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
__es__ Now , to be clear , North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified , board-certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients .
__es__ Now most of the time , I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients .
__es__ And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__es__ And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
__es__ Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
__es__ So I started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
__es__ Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever attended a veterinary conference ?
__es__ For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
__es__ I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
__es__ Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban .
__es__ You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
__es__ But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
__es__ Physicians and scientists , we accept intellectually that our species , Homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
__es__ I feel that tug of human exceptionalism , even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
__es__ Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
__es__ And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
__es__ Fear-induced heart failure .
__es__ But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
__es__ Veterinarians had been diagnosing , treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos , from to deer to rabbits , since the 1970s .
__es__ How many human lives might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. docs and cardiologists ?
__es__ Self-injury .
__es__ Some human patients harm themselves .
__es__ There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
__es__ But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-injury in their self-injuring animals .
__es__ Shouldn &apos;t this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self-injury ?
__es__ Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis .
__es__ Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic .
__es__ They may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
__es__ Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally , a mare , soon after giving birth , will neglect the foal , refusing to nurse , and in some instances , kick the foal , even to death .
__es__ But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
__es__ Oxytocin is the bonding hormone , and this leads to renewed interest , on the part of the mare , in her foal .
__es__ Shouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of ob / gyn &apos;s and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis ?
__es__ Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large .
__es__ To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laundry .
__es__ Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D. &apos; s .
__es__ I &apos;m talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
__es__ So I don &apos;t blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession &apos;s condescension and ignorance .
__es__ But here &apos;s one from the vets : What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
__es__ In the United States and now internationally , at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
__es__ And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and heal .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ Can geographic information make you healthy ?
__es__ In 2001 I got hit by a train .
__es__ My train was a heart attack .
__es__ I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
__es__ And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
__es__ I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
__es__ &quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
__es__ So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
__es__ Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
__es__ That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
__es__ Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
__es__ And you know why I understand that ?
__es__ Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
__es__ Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
__es__ I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
__es__ But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
__es__ What does that mean , my environment ?
__es__ Well , it can mean a lot of things .
__es__ This is my life . These are my life places .
__es__ We all have these .
__es__ While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
__es__ Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
__es__ And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
__es__ You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
__es__ And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
__es__ So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
__es__ And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
__es__ And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
__es__ Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
__es__ I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
__es__ I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
__es__ You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
__es__ And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
__es__ So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
__es__ OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
__es__ Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
__es__ They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
__es__ Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
__es__ And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
__es__ It was insidious and it was really happening .
__es__ Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
__es__ And I moved to Redlands California .
__es__ Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
__es__ Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
__es__ Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
__es__ If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
__es__ So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
__es__ Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
__es__ The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
__es__ No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
__es__ They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
__es__ They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
__es__ Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
__es__ This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
__es__ Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
__es__ Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
__es__ So , how many people are in the white ?
__es__ How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
__es__ Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
__es__ How many have spent it in the red places ?
__es__ Oh , not so lucky .
__es__ There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
__es__ They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
__es__ But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
__es__ And it &apos;s not in yours either .
__es__ So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
__es__ He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
__es__ And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
__es__ And this is where he has spent most of his time .
__es__ If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
__es__ Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
__es__ We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
__es__ And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
__es__ Did you know that data existed ?
__es__ For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
__es__ So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
__es__ This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
__es__ This might be what we end up with .
__es__ This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
__es__ This could be my little assessment .
__es__ And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
__es__ I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
__es__ Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
__es__ It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
__es__ And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
__es__ These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
__es__ The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
__es__ It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
__es__ But it will also be useful for us .
__es__ I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
__es__ Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
__es__ With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
__es__ Just look at that for a minute .
__es__ That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
__es__ That was what he was talking about on that quote .
__es__ And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
__es__ So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
__es__ So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
__es__ And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .

__es__ So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
__es__ When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
__es__ But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
__es__ After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
__es__ It is not important if I like the job or not .
__es__ But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
__es__ That is me playing my imaginary piano .
__es__ An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
__es__ I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
__es__ But no adults liked the idea .
__es__ No adults believed I was serious .
__es__ Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
__es__ So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
__es__ My dream would never come true .
__es__ I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
__es__ But that &apos;s so unfair .
__es__ So I was determined to find another calling .
__es__ Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
__es__ I turned to books .
__es__ I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
__es__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
__es__ Books banned in China , of course .
__es__ &quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
__es__ That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
__es__ The Bible is interesting , but strange .
__es__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
__es__ But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
__es__ &quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
__es__ Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
__es__ For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
__es__ It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
__es__ A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
__es__ Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
__es__ It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
__es__ There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
__es__ Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
__es__ So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
__es__ So I started reading books in pairs .
__es__ So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
__es__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
__es__ For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
__es__ For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
__es__ So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
__es__ &#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
__es__ For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !
__es__ &quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
__es__ I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
__es__ Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
__es__ I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
__es__ Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
__es__ Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
__es__ So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
__es__ So may books be always with you .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high speeds .
__es__ That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
__es__ I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vuvuzela , weird jokes about octopi .
__es__ But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stressing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
__es__ It &apos;s been a major trending topic .
__es__ Being a monolingual American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
__es__ So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
__es__ They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
__es__ In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
__es__ Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
__es__ Every year , more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades .
__es__ Ethan Zuckerman : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
__es__ It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
__es__ Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao .
__es__ And it &apos;s terribly endangered .
__es__ The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Brazilian friends tell me — is pitching in to help out .
__es__ It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
__es__ Now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
__es__ In Portugese , it means &quot; &quot; Shut your mouth , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refers to this guy , Galvao Bueno , who &apos;s the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo .
__es__ And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
__es__ He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again .
__es__ So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea , put up this banner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
__es__ Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
__es__ And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
__es__ So as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
__es__ The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter .
__es__ There &apos;s more than five million of them .
__es__ As far as national representation , 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter .
__es__ That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
__es__ Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
__es__ Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
__es__ Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
__es__ And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
__es__ And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space .
__es__ It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space .
__es__ Twitter recently did some research .
__es__ They looked at their local population .
__es__ They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
__es__ That &apos;s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population .
__es__ And again , that was very shocking to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
__es__ And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .
__es__ And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations .
__es__ This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
__es__ It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that cookout is a mostly black conversation .
__es__ And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
__es__ You click on that cookout tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it .
__es__ But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
__es__ We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend Eli Pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
__es__ And we tend not to see that wider picture .
__es__ Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
__es__ If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Being Digital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
__es__ Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
__es__ He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
__es__ And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of Evian water on the table .
__es__ And Negroponte says this is crazy .
__es__ This is the old economy .
__es__ It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
__es__ We &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is speedy , it &apos;s weightless .
__es__ It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
__es__ And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
__es__ Now , Negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
__es__ He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
__es__ It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
__es__ If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in Fiji , shipped at great expense to the United States .
__es__ It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film .
__es__ It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music .
__es__ It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fiji .
__es__ There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
__es__ There &apos;s crackdowns on the press .
__es__ It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
__es__ Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
__es__ I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
__es__ We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
__es__ And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like airline routes .
__es__ It includes things like the Internet cables .
__es__ We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
__es__ You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bangalore later today .
__es__ Two hops , you &apos;re in Suva , the capitol of Fiji .
__es__ It &apos;s all right there .
__es__ When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
__es__ You start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
__es__ It &apos;s extremely lumpy .
__es__ There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
__es__ There &apos;s basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York .
__es__ but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
__es__ You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
__es__ And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
__es__ When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
__es__ So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
__es__ The world is , in fact , getting more global .
__es__ It &apos;s getting more connected .
__es__ More of problems are global in scale .
__es__ More of our economics is global in scale .
__es__ And our media is less global by the day .
__es__ If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
__es__ That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
__es__ And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world .
__es__ Here &apos;s a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk .
__es__ Alisa &apos;s the president of Public Radio International .
__es__ And she made a cartogram , which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month .
__es__ And you see that when you distort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S.
__es__ and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
__es__ And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
__es__ And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dreadful , and I agree that it &apos;s dreadful — I &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
__es__ When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
__es__ It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
__es__ Here &apos;s a map made by Mark Graham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
__es__ A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded .
__es__ And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
__es__ Even within Wikipedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
__es__ In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
__es__ You probably won &apos;t .
__es__ If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites .
__es__ It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
__es__ So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism .
__es__ We look at the internet .
__es__ We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
__es__ We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
__es__ And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red Sox scores .
__es__ So this is a real problem — not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
__es__ This is a problem we have to solve .
__es__ So here &apos;s the good news .
__es__ For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
__es__ This is a group called Global Voices .
__es__ This is a team of bloggers from around the world .
__es__ Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
__es__ We started in 2004 .
__es__ You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
__es__ Nor do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
__es__ But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
__es__ The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
__es__ In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
__es__ And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
__es__ What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encouragement .
__es__ One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
__es__ And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
__es__ They were doing something much simpler .
__es__ It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
__es__ but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
__es__ Most independent media was shut down .
__es__ And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
__es__ So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
__es__ Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak Malagasy .
__es__ I &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
__es__ Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
__es__ If you &apos;re using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page .
__es__ Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine translation of the page .
__es__ And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dreadful with Chinese .
__es__ And the results can be pretty funny .
__es__ What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this .
__es__ And if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
__es__ There &apos;s a group right now in China called Yeeyan .
__es__ And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
__es__ They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
__es__ They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
__es__ They put it online for free .
__es__ It &apos;s the project of a guy named Zhang Lei , who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
__es__ And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Yeeyan ?
__es__ Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
__es__ My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
__es__ So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guarantee that we &apos;re going to find it .
__es__ When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
__es__ We use a lot of search .
__es__ And search is terrific if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
__es__ But if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
__es__ What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
__es__ The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
__es__ You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
__es__ And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
__es__ To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
__es__ You need a guide .
__es__ So this is Amira Al Hussaini . She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices .
__es__ She has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
__es__ Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
__es__ And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of Ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
__es__ She has to know something about what stories are available .
__es__ Basically , she &apos;s a deejay .
__es__ She &apos;s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
__es__ I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
__es__ I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience .
__es__ I know Amira .
__es__ I can ask her what to read .
__es__ But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
__es__ And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
__es__ So once you start widening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start translating , once you start curating , you end up in some really weird places .
__es__ This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is AfriGadget .
__es__ And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
__es__ And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel .
__es__ And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conceivably care about this ? &quot;
__es__ And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
__es__ This is Erik Hersman . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
__es__ He goes by the moniker White African .
__es__ He &apos;s both a very well known American geek , but he &apos;s also Kenyan ; he was born in Sudan , grew up in Kenya .
__es__ He is a bridge figure .
__es__ He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
__es__ And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
__es__ He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
__es__ These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
__es__ But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
__es__ And that &apos;s where we start talking about xenophiles .
__es__ So if I found myself in the NFL , I suspect I would spend my off-season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hip-hop album .
__es__ Dhani Jones , who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
__es__ Dhani has a television show .
__es__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , Dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
__es__ He finds a local sporting team .
__es__ He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
__es__ And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing .
__es__ It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
__es__ For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
__es__ For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
__es__ But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
__es__ The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia .
__es__ My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TEDGlobal — is that most of you are xenophiles , whether or not you use that term .
__es__ My challenge instead is this .
__es__ It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
__es__ We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have .
__es__ We have to fix our media .
__es__ We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
__es__ We have to fix our immigration policy .
__es__ We need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
__es__ And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
__es__ That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
__es__ And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity .
__es__ It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
__es__ What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
__es__ The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
__es__ So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emptying out .
__es__ The question is , why ?
__es__ And here &apos;s the unromantic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
__es__ And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
__es__ They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
__es__ They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
__es__ They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
__es__ One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
__es__ They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
__es__ Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
__es__ What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
__es__ Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
__es__ There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
__es__ One-sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
__es__ So here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
__es__ And here &apos;s the second punch line .
__es__ That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
__es__ Stars have shined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
__es__ Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
__es__ Guess who was the performing guest ?
__es__ Susan Boyle .
__es__ And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
__es__ It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
__es__ Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
__es__ That was hilarious .
__es__ So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
__es__ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
__es__ And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
__es__ Well , being different is not that difficult .
__es__ We are all different from different perspectives .
__es__ But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
__es__ You may have the chance to make a difference .
__es__ My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
__es__ I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton — it &apos;s still there .
__es__ So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
__es__ That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
__es__ Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
__es__ The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
__es__ So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
__es__ Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
__es__ But actually , they were impressed by my words .
__es__ And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
__es__ After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
__es__ So I was on a national television prime-time show .
__es__ And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
__es__ ( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
__es__ Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
__es__ So we do a lot of things .
__es__ I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
__es__ And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
__es__ But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
__es__ I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
__es__ I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
__es__ I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
__es__ But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
__es__ How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
__es__ So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
__es__ First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
__es__ Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei — 20 years old , beautiful .
__es__ She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
__es__ And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
__es__ She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
__es__ The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
__es__ So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
__es__ All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
__es__ It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
__es__ But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
__es__ It is still boiling .
__es__ It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
__es__ And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
__es__ Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
__es__ Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
__es__ On Tencent , 200 million .
__es__ The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
__es__ About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
__es__ And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
__es__ But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
__es__ So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
__es__ So how are they different ?
__es__ First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
__es__ And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
__es__ That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
__es__ Most of them have fairly good education .
__es__ The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
__es__ In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
__es__ But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
__es__ And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
__es__ So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
__es__ So making a living is not that easy for young people .
__es__ College graduates are not in short supply .
__es__ In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
__es__ So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
__es__ That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
__es__ Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
__es__ They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
__es__ Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
__es__ They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
__es__ And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
__es__ Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
__es__ But they died because of all different personal reasons .
__es__ But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
__es__ For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
__es__ So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
__es__ These diagrams show a more general social background .
__es__ The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
__es__ But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
__es__ The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
__es__ Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
__es__ And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
__es__ And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
__es__ So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
__es__ So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
__es__ Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
__es__ For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
__es__ And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
__es__ Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
__es__ So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
__es__ So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
__es__ Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
__es__ We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
__es__ And guess what , we have faked beef .
__es__ They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
__es__ And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
__es__ So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
__es__ And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
__es__ While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
__es__ China is soon to pass the U.S.
__es__ as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
__es__ But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
__es__ They &apos;re not rich at all .
__es__ They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
__es__ And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
__es__ But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
__es__ So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
__es__ It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
__es__ And also , people are doing good through social media .
__es__ And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
__es__ People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
__es__ And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
__es__ And here also people are helping to find missing children .
__es__ A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
__es__ After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
__es__ So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
__es__ Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
__es__ People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
__es__ How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
__es__ And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
__es__ I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
__es__ And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ And everyone changes as well .
__es__ You suddenly become a disease on legs .
__es__ And , it worked .
__es__ What are the outcomes ?
__es__ Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged .
__es__ This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
__es__ A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
__es__ Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
__es__ My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re honest lies .
__es__ I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from Pablo Picasso , &quot; &quot; We all know that Art is not truth .
__es__ Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand .
__es__ The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a kid , and I loved it , but I had no idea what it meant .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fiction and reality .
__es__ So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences ?
__es__ And I said , I &apos;ve got PowerPoint . Let &apos;s do a Venn diagram .
__es__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Truth . Lies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , boom .
__es__ We &apos;ve got truth and lies and then there &apos;s this little space , the edge , in the middle .
__es__ That liminal space , that &apos;s art .
__es__ All right . Venn diagram . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very helpful either .
__es__ The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art , at least the art of fiction , was , was working with kids .
__es__ I used to be a summer camp counselor .
__es__ I would do it on my summers off from college , and I loved it .
__es__ It was a sports summer camp for four- to six-year-olds .
__es__ I was in charge of the four-year-olds , which is good , because four-year-olds can &apos;t play sports , and neither can I.
__es__ ( Laughter ) I play sports at a four-year-old level , so what would happen is the kids would dribble around some cones , and then got hot , and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life .
__es__ I would tell them about how , on the weekends , I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England .
__es__ And soon , other kids who weren &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Mac Barnett , right ?
__es__ You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question .
__es__ In my fantasy , they were svelte Russian women , but , you know , four-year-olds — you take what you can get in Berkeley , California .
__es__ And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
__es__ I think the pinnacle of this for me — I &apos;ll never forget this — there was this little girl named Riley . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit .
__es__ She would just take her fruit , her mom packed her a melon every day , and she would just throw it in the ivy and then she would eat fruit snacks and pudding cups , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Riley , you can &apos;t do that , you have to eat the fruit . &quot; &quot; And she was like , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , when you throw the fruit in the ivy , pretty soon , it &apos;s going to be overgrown with melons , &quot; &quot; which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children .
__es__ And so Riley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
__es__ That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of camp , I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy , and then at lunchtime , I was like , &quot; Riley , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;
__es__ And — ( Laughter ) — she went trudging through the ivy , and then her eyes just got so wide , and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; Hey , why is there a sticker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the ivy .
__es__ Put them in the trash can . It ruins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Riley carried that melon around with her all day , and she was so proud .
__es__ And Riley knew she didn &apos;t grow a melon in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
__es__ It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
__es__ She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fiction .
__es__ I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
__es__ It &apos;s what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief or poetic faith , for those moments where a story , no matter how strange , has some semblance of the truth , and then you &apos;re able to believe it .
__es__ It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
__es__ Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
__es__ It &apos;s why in two days , people will be descending on Dublin to take the walking tour of Bloomsday and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; Ulysses , &quot; &quot; even though none of that happened .
__es__ Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street to see Sherlock Holmes &apos; apartment , even though 221B is just a number that was painted on a building that never actually had that address .
__es__ We know these characters aren &apos;t real , but we have real feelings about them , and we &apos;re able to do that . We know these characters aren &apos;t real ,
__es__ and yet we also know that they are .
__es__ Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can , and that &apos;s why I love writing for kids .
__es__ I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction .
__es__ When I was a kid , I was obsessed with secret door novels , things like &quot; &quot; Narnia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land .
__es__ And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
__es__ I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s closet doors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mom &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s closet , and there was not a secret magical land there .
__es__ There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I was happy to tell her all about it .
__es__ After college , my first job was working behind one of these secret doors .
__es__ This is a place called 826 Valencia .
__es__ It &apos;s at 826 Valencia Street in the Mission in San Francisco , and when I worked there , there was a publishing company headquartered there called McSweeney &apos;s , a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia , but then the front of it was a strange shop .
__es__ You see , this place was zoned retail , and in San Francisco , they were not going to give us a variance , and so the writer who founded it , a writer named Dave Eggers , to come into compliance with code , he said , &quot; &quot; Fine , I &apos;m just going to build a pirate supply store . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wood .
__es__ There &apos;s drawers you can pull out and get citrus so you don &apos;t get scurvy .
__es__ They have eyepatches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s springtime , pirates want to go wild .
__es__ You don &apos;t know . Black is boring . Pastel .
__es__ Or eyes , also in lots of colors , just glass eyes , depending on how you want to deal with that situation .
__es__ And the store , strangely , people came to them and bought things , and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get instruction in writing , and when you have to walk this weird , liminal , fictional space like this to go do your writing , it &apos;s going to affect the kind of work that you make .
__es__ It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
__es__ So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
__es__ So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
__es__ That &apos;s our motto : &quot; &quot; Whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles .
__es__ Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
__es__ They &apos;re from all eras , including just the 1980s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very recent past .
__es__ There &apos;s our Employees of the Month , including Genghis Khan , Charles Dickens .
__es__ Some great people have come up through our ranks .
__es__ This is our kind of pharmacy section .
__es__ Our architect was covered in red syrup .
__es__ It looked like he had just murdered somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular architect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
__es__ It was going to be the highlight of our store .
__es__ So we just put that sign on it that said , &quot; &quot; Out of order . Come back yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that ended up being a better joke than slushies , so we just left it there forever .
__es__ Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
__es__ Barbarian repellent . It &apos;s full of salad and potpourri — things that barbarians hate .
__es__ Dead languages .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
__es__ And Viking Odorant , which comes in lots of great scents : toenails , sweat and rotten vegetables , pyre ash .
__es__ Because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield , not under your arms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emotion chips , so robots can feel love or fear .
__es__ Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude , which we did not expect .
__es__ ( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
__es__ But there &apos;s a nonprofit behind it , and kids go through a door that says &quot; &quot; Employees Only &quot; &quot; and they end up in this space where they do homework and write stories and make films and this is a book release party where kids will read .
__es__ There &apos;s a quarterly that &apos;s published with just writing that &apos;s done by the kids who come every day after school , and we have release parties and they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses .
__es__ And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
__es__ The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
__es__ You can &apos;t find the seams on the fiction , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fiction that &apos;s colonized the real world .
__es__ I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
__es__ There &apos;s a term called metafiction , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and meta &apos;s having a moment now .
__es__ Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis , but it &apos;s been around .
__es__ It &apos;s almost as old as storytelling itself .
__es__ And one metafictive technique is breaking the fourth wall . Right ?
__es__ It &apos;s when an actor will turn to the audience and say , &quot; &quot; I am an actor , these are just rafters . &quot; &quot; And even that supposedly honest moment , I would argue , is in service of the lie , but it &apos;s supposed to foreground the artificiality of the fiction .
__es__ For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
__es__ If I &apos;m going to break down the fourth wall , I want fiction to escape and come into the real world .
__es__ I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
__es__ And so I try to do this in my books .
__es__ And here &apos;s just one example .
__es__ This is the first book that I ever made .
__es__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it &apos;s a punishment and it ruins his life .
__es__ So it &apos;s delivered overnight by FedUp .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
__es__ He lives in San Francisco — very tough city to own a blue whale in .
__es__ A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
__es__ This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
__es__ But underneath the jacket is this case , and that &apos;s the cover underneath the book , the jacket , and there &apos;s an ad that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial for a blue whale .
__es__ And you can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and we &apos;ll send you a whale .
__es__ And kids do write in .
__es__ So here &apos;s a letter . It says , &quot; &quot; Dear people , I bet you 10 bucks you won &apos;t send me a blue whale .
__es__ Eliot Gannon ( age 6 ) . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So what Eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm — ( Laughter ) — that says that due to a change in customs laws , their whale has been held up in Sognefjord , which is a very lovely fjord , and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord and Norwegian food for a little while . It digresses . ( Laughter )
__es__ But it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you .
__es__ He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
__es__ And when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the outgoing message , it &apos;s just whale sounds and then a beep , which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound .
__es__ And they get a picture of their whale too .
__es__ So this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Nico &apos;s message .
__es__ This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
__es__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
__es__ I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
__es__ So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . Bye .
__es__ Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
__es__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
__es__ I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
__es__ MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
__es__ He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
__es__ You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that he likes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the crossword puzzles that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more message from Nico .
__es__ This is the Christmas message from Nico .
__es__ &#91; Beep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
__es__ It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so busy because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a whale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a merry Christmas .
__es__ So have a nice Christmas , and bye-bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
__es__ MB : I actually got Nico , I hadn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a message two days ago .
__es__ His voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
__es__ But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
__es__ I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create .
__es__ I feel lucky . Kids like Nico are the best readers , and they deserve the best stories we can give them .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Phew , phew , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Usually when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scream out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
__es__ And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( Vvvwow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Whoa ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
__es__ Well , what I &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
__es__ See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets — ( Portamento ) — and you can get it really low .
__es__ And with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
__es__ ( Tones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
__es__ ( Flourish ... Beep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I startle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( Blip ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
__es__ Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
__es__ We &apos;re going to do a song by David Mash called &quot; &quot; Listen : the Words Are Gone , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ; there are so many .
__es__ And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin .
__es__ It was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , Léon Theremin — he also was a musician besides an inventor — he came up with the idea for making the theremin , I think , when he was working on some shortwave radios .
__es__ And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( Screeching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pitches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now .
__es__ And a lot of times , even kids nowadays , they &apos;ll make reference to a theremin by going , &quot; &quot; Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
__es__ And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibrato gets out of hand .
__es__ You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
__es__ You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
__es__ It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
__es__ And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( Tone rising out of key ) — and breathing will make it ...
__es__ ( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
__es__ I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
__es__ And if I go to a club and play a gig , people are like , &quot; Here , have some drinks on us ! &quot;
__es__ And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Teetering tones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
__es__ it &apos;s similar to being a vocalist , except instead of it coming out of your throat , you &apos;re controlling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ; you &apos;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .
__es__ You just have to always adjust to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
__es__ I think we will play another tune now .
__es__ I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; Lush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__es__ But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a lasting one that remains .
__es__ I was born in a family full of colors .
__es__ He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents .
__es__ The matriarch , my grandma , has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair .
__es__ My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
__es__ My mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian , with a pinch of hazel and honey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
__es__ She has two sisters .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Growing up in this family , color was never important for me .
__es__ Outside home , however , things were different soon .
__es__ Color had many other meanings .
__es__ I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
__es__ It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil .
__es__ I was made of flesh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
__es__ I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
__es__ By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the maid .
__es__ I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends .
__es__ And many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elevator .
__es__ Because in the end , with this color and this hair , I cannot belong to some places .
__es__ Years later I married a Spaniard .
__es__ But not any Spaniard .
__es__ I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
__es__ What will be the color of your children ?
__es__ But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
__es__ Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the untrue white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
__es__ It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
__es__ It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
__es__ I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
__es__ The snowball started to roll .
__es__ The project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
__es__ just happened .
__es__ And among them , my favorite : when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
__es__ I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
__es__ Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the Forbes list , to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat .
__es__ All kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or terminally ill .
__es__ We all together build Humanae .
__es__ Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
__es__ When modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
__es__ Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
__es__ This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
__es__ Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people .
__es__ It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label .
__es__ It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
__es__ I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
__es__ Perhaps we should stop .
__es__ Just to show you some examples , illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies .
__es__ It &apos;s a collection of faces .
__es__ And talking about foreign affairs , I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
__es__ teachers .
__es__ They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
__es__ Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
__es__ My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
__es__ As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
__es__ As an individual , as Angélica , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist .
__es__ becomes love .
__es__ The last country — the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
__es__ We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
__es__ That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__es__ I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
__es__ I feel so fortunate .
__es__ I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
__es__ I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
__es__ It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
__es__ But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
__es__ I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
__es__ Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
__es__ And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
__es__ She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Tweets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
__es__ She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
__es__ But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
__es__ Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
__es__ And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
__es__ And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
__es__ And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
__es__ It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
__es__ And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
__es__ It all started back in 1977 .
__es__ I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
__es__ And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
__es__ And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses — and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
__es__ So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
__es__ It was an experimental education program .
__es__ It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
__es__ And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention — kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
__es__ And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
__es__ And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
__es__ There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
__es__ Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
__es__ She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
__es__ There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
__es__ And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
__es__ So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
__es__ His name is Chris Farina .
__es__ Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
__es__ Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
__es__ ( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
__es__ He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
__es__ Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
__es__ So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
__es__ It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
__es__ And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
__es__ And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the eerie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
__es__ What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
__es__ I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
__es__ That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
__es__ I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
__es__ And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
__es__ And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
__es__ And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
__es__ And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
__es__ You know the one .
__es__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
__es__ I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
__es__ And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
__es__ And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
__es__ My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
__es__ That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
__es__ And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
__es__ And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
__es__ I am one of her teaching gestures .
__es__ And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
__es__ And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
__es__ It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
__es__ And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
__es__ I &apos;m not here alone .
__es__ There are many people on this stage right now .
__es__ And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
__es__ It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
__es__ I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
__es__ We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
__es__ I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
__es__ I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
__es__ So I thought , well they like to play games .
__es__ I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 — but something interactive .
__es__ And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
__es__ And it has four Plexiglass layers .
__es__ There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
__es__ There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
__es__ There are four countries around the board .
__es__ The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
__es__ They have different assets , commercial and military .
__es__ And each country has a cabinet .
__es__ There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
__es__ I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
__es__ I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
__es__ There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
__es__ There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
__es__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
__es__ And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
__es__ So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
__es__ I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
__es__ And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
__es__ There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
__es__ If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
__es__ So I also have in the game a saboteur — some child — it &apos;s basically a troublemaker — and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
__es__ But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
__es__ And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
__es__ The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; Fourth-graders understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
__es__ They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
__es__ Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
__es__ And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
__es__ I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
__es__ I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
__es__ The students run the game .
__es__ I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
__es__ So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
__es__ ( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
__es__ You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
__es__ See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
__es__ John Hunter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
__es__ And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
__es__ And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
__es__ And so I apologize to them as well .
__es__ I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
__es__ Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
__es__ Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
__es__ ( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
__es__ ( Chatter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
__es__ It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
__es__ I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
__es__ There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
__es__ It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
__es__ So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
__es__ In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
__es__ And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
__es__ And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
__es__ Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
__es__ She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
__es__ And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
__es__ We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
__es__ This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her girlfriends she said that .
__es__ That &apos;s a breach there .
__es__ And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
__es__ ( Laughter ) They are the toughest opponents .
__es__ And we were very upset .
__es__ I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
__es__ But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
__es__ So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
__es__ Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
__es__ She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
__es__ Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
__es__ That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
__es__ I could not have designed that in teaching it .
__es__ It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
__es__ ( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
__es__ We have a letter in the game .
__es__ If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
__es__ You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
__es__ So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
__es__ And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County — and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
__es__ It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
__es__ She read two sentences .
__es__ By the third sentence , she was in tears .
__es__ I was in tears .
__es__ Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
__es__ We all lose .
__es__ And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
__es__ I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
__es__ He &apos;s been in many battles .
__es__ ( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
__es__ I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
__es__ But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
__es__ One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
__es__ And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
__es__ JH : I get chills every time I see that .
__es__ That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
__es__ And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
__es__ But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
__es__ We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
__es__ We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
__es__ So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
__es__ This is about my friend Brennan .
__es__ We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
__es__ The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
__es__ Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
__es__ The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
__es__ He says , &quot; &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
__es__ So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
__es__ There was no way they could win .
__es__ And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time — there was about a minute left — and despair just settled over the room .
__es__ I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
__es__ I should have gotten it so they could have won .
__es__ They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
__es__ I &apos;ve failed them .
__es__ And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
__es__ And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
__es__ Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
__es__ They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
__es__ They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
__es__ I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
__es__ Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
__es__ The parents were looking in the window .
__es__ And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
__es__ He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
__es__ And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
__es__ We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
__es__ And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
__es__ Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
__es__ Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
__es__ Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
__es__ Every game we play is different .
__es__ Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
__es__ Some games are more about warfare .
__es__ But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
__es__ I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
__es__ And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
__es__ And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
__es__ If only .
__es__ And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
__es__ I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
__es__ He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
__es__ His village is near Mogadishu .
__es__ Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
__es__ With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .
__es__ When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
__es__ He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
__es__ Maybe a year passes , nothing .
__es__ One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
__es__ He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
__es__ He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
__es__ He is introduced to this young woman .
__es__ He eventually gets married .
__es__ He starts this new life .
__es__ He has a purpose in life .
__es__ One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
__es__ That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
__es__ So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
__es__ He was waiting .
__es__ He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
__es__ This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
__es__ And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
__es__ It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
__es__ For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
__es__ Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
__es__ By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
__es__ If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
__es__ And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
__es__ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
__es__ They pretty much do nothing .
__es__ I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Madina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
__es__ I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
__es__ What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood ?
__es__ Would I have become a terrorist ?
__es__ I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
__es__ My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .
__es__ I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
__es__ We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
__es__ One of the young men in the room was Aden .
__es__ He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
__es__ There were no jobs , no opportunities .
__es__ I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
__es__ They sought people like him out .
__es__ But his story takes a different route .
__es__ In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
__es__ Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around .
__es__ Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
__es__ He started a motorbike company .
__es__ He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
__es__ He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
__es__ How is this story different ?
__es__ What makes his story different ?
__es__ I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
__es__ It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
__es__ It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
__es__ And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
__es__ I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .
__es__ He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
__es__ He &apos;s actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad .
__es__ If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
__es__ for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
__es__ He started a landscaping and design floral company .
__es__ He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
__es__ And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
__es__ There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
__es__ He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
__es__ And he doesn &apos;t grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
__es__ So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
__es__ They had never really thought about starting up a business .
__es__ They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
__es__ He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
__es__ He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
__es__ By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
__es__ They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
__es__ So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
__es__ They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
__es__ Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
__es__ For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
__es__ It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
__es__ Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
__es__ I believe he is selling hope .
__es__ His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
__es__ Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him .
__es__ He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
__es__ These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
__es__ So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
__es__ I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
__es__ I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
__es__ So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burniss Travis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano . ( Applause )
__es__ So the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
__es__ It is really a sacred space .
__es__ And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
__es__ You really are alive right here in this moment .
__es__ There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand .
__es__ We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
__es__ In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Titi Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
__es__ Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
__es__ You have no time for projected ideas .
__es__ So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
__es__ So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the bandstand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
__es__ The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
__es__ Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
__es__ So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
__es__ So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
__es__ ( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F. ( Music )
__es__ See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
__es__ If you played an E.
__es__ See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
__es__ If you played an F # though , ( Dissonance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
__es__ So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
__es__ And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
__es__ And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
__es__ And we won &apos;t react to it .
__es__ He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
__es__ We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
__es__ ( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
__es__ The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
__es__ It was an opportunity that was missed .
__es__ So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
__es__ He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
__es__ We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
__es__ ( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
__es__ I ended up creating a melody out of it .
__es__ The texture changed in the drums this time .
__es__ It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
__es__ So there is no mistake .
__es__ The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
__es__ So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
__es__ It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
__es__ And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
__es__ We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
__es__ So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
__es__ Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
__es__ And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micromanage in jazz .
__es__ You have some people who do .
__es__ But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
__es__ If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
__es__ ready , just play some time .
__es__ One , two , one , two , three , four .
__es__ ( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
__es__ I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
__es__ This is a science of listening .
__es__ It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
__es__ So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
__es__ When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
__es__ Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
__es__ ( Music ) Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
__es__ It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
__es__ It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
__es__ It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__es__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
__es__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__es__ I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
__es__ So most everyone watches TV .
__es__ We like it . We like some parts of it .
__es__ Here in America , people actually love TV .
__es__ The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
__es__ Okay ?
__es__ Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
__es__ But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
__es__ They , in fact , berate it .
__es__ They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
__es__ My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
__es__ So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
__es__ So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
__es__ Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
__es__ We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
__es__ We &apos;re talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years .
__es__ How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
__es__ How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
__es__ Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
__es__ You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .
__es__ As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
__es__ We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
__es__ We feel awe , we feel pity .
__es__ That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
__es__ The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
__es__ We love to watch TV .
__es__ This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
__es__ Animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
__es__ So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
__es__ Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
__es__ I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
__es__ Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
__es__ So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
__es__ We went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
__es__ We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
__es__ We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
__es__ How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
__es__ Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
__es__ Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
__es__ What did this mean for you ?
__es__ So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
__es__ But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
__es__ And on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
__es__ So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
__es__ Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern .
__es__ And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen .
__es__ Okay , here we go .
__es__ So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
__es__ Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
__es__ Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
__es__ As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
__es__ That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
__es__ Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
__es__ Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane .
__es__ Why ?
__es__ The Cuban Missile Crisis , JFK is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , MLK is shot , Bobby Kennedy is shot , Watergate .
__es__ Look what happens .
__es__ In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
__es__ Moral ambiguity takes off .
__es__ They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a telegenic president , is in office .
__es__ It &apos;s trying to recover .
__es__ But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran-Contra , the Challenger disaster , Chernobyl .
__es__ Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
__es__ Take a look at this .
__es__ This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
__es__ But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
__es__ Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; Andy Griffith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
__es__ This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
__es__ Irreverence starts to rise .
__es__ Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
__es__ You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
__es__ You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gomer Pyle &quot; &quot; — in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
__es__ What &apos;s number one ?
__es__ The socially irreverent hippie show , &quot; Rowan and Martin &apos;s Laugh-In . &quot;
__es__ They &apos;re all living together , right .
__es__ Viewers had responded dramatically .
__es__ Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
__es__ When you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ?
__es__ It means in the 1966 television season , The &quot; &quot; Smothers Brothers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
__es__ This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presidency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
__es__ So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
__es__ In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
__es__ Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
__es__ Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
__es__ Now look at this .
__es__ The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
__es__ You have &quot; &quot; All in the Family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top-10 for the entire 70s — &quot; MAS * H. &quot;
__es__ In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration .
__es__ Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
__es__ It can make me feel this ?
__es__ It can change us ?
__es__ So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
__es__ Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
__es__ This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .
__es__ You &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
__es__ Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
__es__ No . In the 70s you have the bellwether show &quot; &quot; The Bionic Woman &quot; &quot; that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Million-Dollar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s Angels . &quot; &quot; Another spike in the 1980s — another spike in shows about control and power .
__es__ What were those shows ?
__es__ Glamorous and rich .
__es__ &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
__es__ Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
__es__ So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
__es__ Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
__es__ Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
__es__ The 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cheers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfeld . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
__es__ But look : X marks the spot .
__es__ In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succumbs to judgment once and for all .
__es__ Why not ?
__es__ We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
__es__ We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
__es__ We had 9 / 11 .
__es__ Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
__es__ Look what happens when we keep going .
__es__ At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
__es__ What do people want in their TV then ?
__es__ I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
__es__ Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
__es__ No , they want judgment .
__es__ I can vote you off the island .
__es__ I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
__es__ I can choose the next American Idol . You &apos;re fired .
__es__ That &apos;s all great , right ?
__es__ So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
__es__ We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
__es__ There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom .
__es__ The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Beaver . &quot; &quot; Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
__es__ Maude Findlay , the epitome of the irreverent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even menopause on TV .
__es__ The 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington .
__es__ Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .
__es__ This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
__es__ Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
__es__ So to you all , the women of TEDWomen , the men of TEDWomen , the global audiences of TEDWomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
__es__ But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
__es__ They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as viewers , through your collective social consciences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
__es__ So thanks very much .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
__es__ And I &apos;ll quote three people : Vannevar Bush , Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee .
__es__ So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
__es__ This is Vannevar Bush .
__es__ Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
__es__ And in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly .
__es__ And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
__es__ We don &apos;t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth .
__es__ The brain works by association .
__es__ With one item in its thought , it snaps instantly to the next item .
__es__ And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process .
__es__ And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
__es__ And the memex would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
__es__ Now this was in 1945 .
__es__ A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
__es__ And nobody knew anything about it .
__es__ So this was before the computer was invented .
__es__ And he proposed this machine called the memex .
__es__ And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
__es__ So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S. Air Force officer .
__es__ And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
__es__ And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
__es__ And by the mid-60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
__es__ He built a system .
__es__ The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
__es__ And in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called NLS for oN-Line System .
__es__ And this is Doug Engelbart .
__es__ He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968 .
__es__ What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstrated this system .
__es__ He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
__es__ And he works this system .
__es__ And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
__es__ And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
__es__ So this is where the mouse came from as well .
__es__ So this is Doug Engelbart .
__es__ The trouble with Doug Engelbart &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
__es__ So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
__es__ But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
__es__ And my company , OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh .
__es__ And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
__es__ And this began to get a head of steam .
__es__ Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
__es__ They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .
__es__ The magazines started to cover it .
__es__ Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext .
__es__ We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version .
__es__ And our PC version became quite mature .
__es__ These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
__es__ You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
__es__ We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html .
__es__ We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
__es__ And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks .
__es__ So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990 .
__es__ And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you Ian Ritchie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
__es__ And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
__es__ But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day .
__es__ And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
__es__ I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he &apos;s not going to do this .
__es__ So we didn &apos;t do it .
__es__ In the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
__es__ In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .
__es__ In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web .
__es__ And I saw it , and I thought , yep , that &apos;s it .
__es__ And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in Edinburgh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker .
__es__ So that puts me in pretty illustrious company .
__es__ There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles .
__es__ There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
__es__ And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling &apos;s Harry Potter , I guess .
__es__ On the other hand , there &apos;s Marc Andreessen who wrote the world &apos;s first browser for the World Wide Web .
__es__ And according to Fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
__es__ But is he happy ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
__es__ In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
__es__ And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
__es__ He was not a political prisoner .
__es__ He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
__es__ What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
__es__ And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
__es__ We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
__es__ It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
__es__ I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
__es__ First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
__es__ The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
__es__ And the third is commitment .
__es__ So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
__es__ Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
__es__ And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
__es__ My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
__es__ And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
__es__ The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
__es__ And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; inaudible name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; Khrew , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have defended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
__es__ And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
__es__ And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
__es__ She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
__es__ She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d miscarried .
__es__ And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
__es__ But Cambodia is not alone .
__es__ I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
__es__ Or is it other countries ?
__es__ But it is in so many countries .
__es__ In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
__es__ Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
__es__ And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
__es__ And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
__es__ A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
__es__ But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
__es__ For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; inaudible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mumbling
__es__ and grumbling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
__es__ The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
__es__ I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
__es__ What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
__es__ And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
__es__ I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . Lawyers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
__es__ Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
__es__ But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
__es__ So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
__es__ And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
__es__ And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
__es__ The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
__es__ It &apos;s not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
__es__ We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
__es__ So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
__es__ And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
__es__ And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
__es__ So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
__es__ And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
__es__ This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
__es__ So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
__es__ We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
__es__ But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
__es__ And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
__es__ Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
__es__ It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
__es__ Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
__es__ I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice .
__es__ Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
__es__ So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
__es__ So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
__es__ You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
__es__ Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
__es__ And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vishna . He &apos;s a 4-year-old boy .
__es__ He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
__es__ But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
__es__ And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ Doesn &apos;t say a word — just rolls away with it .
__es__ Doesn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there .
__es__ You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a stink .
__es__ You &apos;d follow that guy back to his cubicle and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my chair ? &quot; &quot; Okay , so now it &apos;s Tuesday morning and you &apos;re at the office , and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar .
__es__ And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
__es__ It &apos;s an involuntary reflex — ding , click , bing — it &apos;s in your calendar , &quot; &quot; Gotta go , I &apos;m already late for a meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Meetings are important , right ?
__es__ And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
__es__ Let me tell you why .
__es__ There &apos;s the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
__es__ It &apos;s kind of funny .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
__es__ Hi , it &apos;s Joe . I &apos;m working from home today .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Hi , Joe . Thanks for joining us today , great .
__es__ Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__es__ No ? I thought I heard a beep . ( Laughter ) Sound familiar ?
__es__ Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
__es__ And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of views every month .
__es__ It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
__es__ Thousands of people wrote things like , &quot; OMG , that was my day today ! &quot;
__es__ &quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
__es__ &quot; This is my life . &quot;
__es__ But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
__es__ In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
__es__ It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
__es__ Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
__es__ And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it .
__es__ People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) .
__es__ And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
__es__ &quot; Share a childhood story . &quot;
__es__ &quot; End with an inspiring call to action . &quot;
__es__ No .
__es__ That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
__es__ In fact , if you overuse those devices , you &apos;re just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative .
__es__ But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a ringside seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers , like these .
__es__ And it &apos;s this : Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners &apos; minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
__es__ Let me show you what I mean .
__es__ Here &apos;s Haley .
__es__ She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly , she &apos;s terrified .
__es__ And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
__es__ Let &apos;s take a look inside Haley &apos;s brain for a moment .
__es__ And incredibly , this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
__es__ But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
__es__ Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
__es__ Ideas come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic .
__es__ Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
__es__ CA : Your mind is teeming with ideas , and not just randomly .
__es__ They &apos;re carefully linked together .
__es__ Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview .
__es__ It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
__es__ And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
__es__ So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial .
__es__ Now , different people &apos;s worldviews can be dramatically different .
__es__ &quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an expert , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
__es__ So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
__es__ Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
__es__ So pick one idea , and make it the through-line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
__es__ Two , give your listeners a reason to care .
__es__ Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
__es__ And the main tool to achieve that ?
__es__ Curiosity .
__es__ Stir your audience &apos;s curiosity .
__es__ If you can reveal a disconnection in someone &apos;s worldview , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
__es__ And once you &apos;ve sparked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
__es__ Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
__es__ You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners &apos; minds — but not your language , their language .
__es__ The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences .
__es__ Now , metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listener already understands .
__es__ CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds .
__es__ It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
__es__ Four , here &apos;s the final tip : Make your idea worth sharing .
__es__ By that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Who does this idea benefit ? &quot;
__es__ And I need you to be honest with the answer .
__es__ If the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
__es__ The audience will see right through you .
__es__ Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
__es__ So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
__es__ I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
__es__ I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
__es__ So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
__es__ I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
__es__ And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
__es__ To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
__es__ One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
__es__ For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
__es__ This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
__es__ This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
__es__ This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
__es__ all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
__es__ So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
__es__ So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
__es__ One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
__es__ You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
__es__ Students lack perseverance .
__es__ They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
__es__ There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
__es__ And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
__es__ This is really destructive .
__es__ David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
__es__ He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
__es__ He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
__es__ You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
__es__ And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
__es__ I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
__es__ I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
__es__ I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
__es__ ( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
__es__ It applies equally to math .
__es__ Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
__es__ I believe in real life .
__es__ And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
__es__ I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
__es__ And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
__es__ When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
__es__ And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
__es__ You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
__es__ So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
__es__ Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
__es__ It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
__es__ But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
__es__ I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
__es__ You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
__es__ You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
__es__ So I hope you can see .
__es__ I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
__es__ That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
__es__ So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
__es__ So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
__es__ And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
__es__ So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
__es__ And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
__es__ And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
__es__ And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
__es__ And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
__es__ The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
__es__ And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
__es__ But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
__es__ Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
__es__ It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
__es__ And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
__es__ He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
__es__ So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
__es__ And here &apos;s how it works .
__es__ I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
__es__ The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
__es__ First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
__es__ Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
__es__ And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
__es__ None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
__es__ Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
__es__ Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
__es__ So now we have a water tank .
__es__ How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
__es__ And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
__es__ So now we have the real deal .
__es__ How long will it take it to fill it up ?
__es__ And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
__es__ And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
__es__ It &apos;s tedious .
__es__ Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
__es__ And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
__es__ And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
__es__ But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
__es__ Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
__es__ We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
__es__ And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
__es__ And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
__es__ We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
__es__ But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
__es__ So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
__es__ These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
__es__ We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
__es__ We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
__es__ This has been a lot of fun .
__es__ I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
__es__ And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
__es__ It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
__es__ I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
__es__ I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
__es__ Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
__es__ I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
__es__ And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
__es__ And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
__es__ Math makes sense of the world .
__es__ Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
__es__ So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
__es__ We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
__es__ Interpreter : Piano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my favorite musical symbol .
__es__ It means to play softly .
__es__ Two p &apos;s — even softer .
__es__ Four p &apos;s — extremely soft .
__es__ So it has a history of about 200 years .
__es__ I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
__es__ And I believed it to be true .
__es__ Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
__es__ So how is it that I understand sound ?
__es__ Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
__es__ You people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound .
__es__ Thus I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
__es__ &quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the potato-chip bag ! &quot;
__es__ I &apos;m hyper-vigilant around sound .
__es__ TBD , to be decided .
__es__ TBC , to be continued .
__es__ TBA , to be announced .
__es__ In Deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
__es__ This is a sign for &quot; &quot; staff &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__es__ Prior to this time , I had been working as a painter .
__es__ At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ...
__es__ Now sound has come into my art territory .
__es__ Is it going to further distance me from art ?
__es__ I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
__es__ I started creating a new body of work .
__es__ I chose to be empowered .
__es__ There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .
__es__ And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
__es__ And that way , I &apos;m able to maintain relevancy in society today .
__es__ And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
__es__ They help me to be heard .
__es__ And their voices hold value and currency .
__es__ And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL .
__es__ And the same holds true for a concept in ASL .
__es__ ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
__es__ The same applies to music in regards to pitch , tone and volume .
__es__ This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT .
__es__ I &apos;m looking at you .
__es__ Staring at you .
__es__ Uh-oh .
__es__ What are you looking at ?
__es__ Aw , stop .
__es__ For example , this is the sign for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun rises and sets .
__es__ All ... day .
__es__ I feel the same holds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
__es__ This is ALL-NIGHT , represented in this drawing .
__es__ We have the staff across the head and the chest .
__es__ Everybody , hands up .
__es__ Yes , got it .
__es__ And now this .
__es__ This is &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__es__ And again .
__es__ This is &quot; &quot; enlightenment &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__es__ &quot; Fall in love , &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; and &quot; &quot; enlightenment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
__es__ And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
__es__ And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
__es__ Denise Kahler-Braaten : Hey , that &apos;s me .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
__es__ It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
__es__ It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
__es__ So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
__es__ Sort of an interesting thing .
__es__ It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
__es__ And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
__es__ You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
__es__ In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
__es__ And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
__es__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
__es__ I actually went to see this one .
__es__ There was a lot of people there .
__es__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
__es__ I was born and raised in North Korea .
__es__ Although my family constantly struggled against poverty , I was always loved and cared for first , because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
__es__ But then the great famine began in 1994 .
__es__ I was four years old .
__es__ My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
__es__ I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
__es__ Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
__es__ For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
__es__ On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
__es__ But even as a child , I could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
__es__ Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
__es__ I saw my father wither away and die .
__es__ In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
__es__ Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
__es__ It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
__es__ But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
__es__ I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
__es__ Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
__es__ My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
__es__ My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
__es__ But that is no way to survive .
__es__ I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
__es__ So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
__es__ Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
__es__ Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
__es__ I was not uncommon .
__es__ Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
__es__ When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
__es__ That hope kept me alive .
__es__ I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
__es__ I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
__es__ But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
__es__ Hope kept me alive .
__es__ Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
__es__ After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
__es__ I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
__es__ I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
__es__ I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
__es__ I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
__es__ North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
__es__ Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
__es__ I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
__es__ I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
__es__ I was 16 years old .
__es__ I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
__es__ I thought more people would help me .
__es__ But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
__es__ I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
__es__ By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
__es__ Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
__es__ I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
__es__ Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
__es__ And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
__es__ Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
__es__ My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
__es__ At one point , my father gave up on me .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
__es__ But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
__es__ So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
__es__ I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
__es__ I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
__es__ But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
__es__ And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
__es__ When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
__es__ I was so happy .
__es__ I looked at him sitting next to me .
__es__ He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
__es__ Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
__es__ My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
__es__ I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
__es__ My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
__es__ And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
__es__ I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
__es__ ( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
__es__ You have to choose to believe in hope .
__es__ You have to make it yourself .
__es__ In North Korea , I made it myself .
__es__ Hope brought me to America .
__es__ But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
__es__ My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
__es__ I did not come here by myself .
__es__ I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
__es__ Many people helped me along the way to get here .
__es__ North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
__es__ They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
__es__ This is my message to you .
__es__ Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
__es__ Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
__es__ My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
__es__ In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
__es__ A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
__es__ But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
__es__ I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
__es__ Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
__es__ AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
__es__ ( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
__es__ Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
__es__ I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
__es__ And I — oh , gosh .
__es__ I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
__es__ I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
__es__ And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
__es__ AH : Sure , please .
__es__ JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
__es__ I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
__es__ How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
__es__ Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
__es__ That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
__es__ And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
__es__ The reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
__es__ So for example , in the case of Ticketmaster , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
__es__ CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
__es__ And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
__es__ So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
__es__ The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
__es__ But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
__es__ Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
__es__ This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
__es__ ( Laughter ) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
__es__ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
__es__ This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
__es__ And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
__es__ So let me tell you what this project started .
__es__ So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
__es__ When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
__es__ I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
__es__ But then I started feeling bad .
__es__ See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
__es__ And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs .
__es__ So then I started feeling bad .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
__es__ But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
__es__ So see , here &apos;s the thing .
__es__ While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
__es__ Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
__es__ So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
__es__ Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
__es__ And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
__es__ So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
__es__ So let me explain how this works .
__es__ So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
__es__ Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
__es__ Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
__es__ Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
__es__ You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
__es__ Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
__es__ It gives you an image for every page of the book .
__es__ This is an image with text for every page of the book .
__es__ The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
__es__ That &apos;s using a technology called OCR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
__es__ Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
__es__ Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
__es__ For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
__es__ So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
__es__ So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
__es__ And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
__es__ But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
__es__ So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
__es__ We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
__es__ And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
__es__ And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
__es__ So this is how the system works .
__es__ And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
__es__ So for example , Ticketmaster .
__es__ So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
__es__ Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
__es__ Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
__es__ And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
__es__ It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
__es__ And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet .
__es__ ( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
__es__ And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
__es__ So funny things can happen .
__es__ For example , we presented this word .
__es__ It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christians &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
__es__ But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
__es__ So we get this . ( Text : bad christians ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Oops . ( Laughter )
__es__ Here &apos;s another really bad one .
__es__ JohnEdwards.com ( Text : Damn liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
__es__ Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
__es__ See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
__es__ So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
__es__ I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
__es__ Here &apos;s how it works .
__es__ Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
__es__ Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
__es__ But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
__es__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
__es__ There are tens of thousands of these .
__es__ Some of them are very cute . ( Text : clenched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funnier .
__es__ ( Text : stoned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg . ( Laughter )
__es__ Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
__es__ So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
__es__ This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA : 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
__es__ And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
__es__ So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
__es__ It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
__es__ And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
__es__ But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
__es__ So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
__es__ So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
__es__ Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
__es__ This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
__es__ It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
__es__ Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
__es__ ( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
__es__ So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
__es__ It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Severin Hacker .
__es__ Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
__es__ So I posed the question to my graduate student .
__es__ By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
__es__ So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
__es__ Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
__es__ First of all , translating the Web .
__es__ So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
__es__ A large fraction of it is in English .
__es__ If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
__es__ But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
__es__ So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
__es__ So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
__es__ Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
__es__ Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
__es__ Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
__es__ Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
__es__ Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
__es__ It makes a lot of mistakes .
__es__ Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
__es__ So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
__es__ Actually it was a forum post .
__es__ It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
__es__ It was translated from Japanese into English .
__es__ So I &apos;ll just let you read .
__es__ This person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
__es__ So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
__es__ So he &apos;s just explaining something .
__es__ Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
__es__ ( Text : At often , the goat-time install a error is vomit . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
__es__ ( Text : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the dragon ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
__es__ ( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
__es__ ( Text : Please apologize for your stupidity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
__es__ So back to the question .
__es__ So we need people to translate the whole Web .
__es__ So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
__es__ We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
__es__ We could do that .
__es__ Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
__es__ For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
__es__ Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
__es__ It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
__es__ If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
__es__ So it would be very expensive .
__es__ So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
__es__ Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
__es__ The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
__es__ So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
__es__ That &apos;s a big problem .
__es__ The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
__es__ How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
__es__ Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
__es__ So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
__es__ Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
__es__ But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
__es__ There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
__es__ And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals , and that is language education .
__es__ So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
__es__ People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
__es__ And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
__es__ For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
__es__ So people really , really want to learn a new language .
__es__ So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Duolingo — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
__es__ And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
__es__ So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
__es__ There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
__es__ We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
__es__ And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
__es__ And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
__es__ But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
__es__ Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
__es__ First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
__es__ We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
__es__ People really can learn a language with it .
__es__ And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
__es__ So people really do learn a language .
__es__ And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
__es__ Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
__es__ As opposed to learning with made-up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
__es__ So people really do learn a language .
__es__ But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
__es__ So let me show you one example .
__es__ This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
__es__ The top is the German .
__es__ The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
__es__ And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
__es__ You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
__es__ Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
__es__ We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
__es__ Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
__es__ So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
__es__ Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
__es__ So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
__es__ And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
__es__ Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
__es__ Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
__es__ So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
__es__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
__es__ The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
__es__ So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
__es__ This is totally biased towards the rich .
__es__ Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
__es__ So this is how we could monetize this .
__es__ Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
__es__ But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
__es__ So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
__es__ So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
__es__ We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
__es__ We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
__es__ By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
__es__ So thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
__es__ And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
__es__ And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians .
__es__ She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
__es__ And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
__es__ But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
__es__ The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
__es__ Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
__es__ So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
__es__ Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
__es__ In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
__es__ And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
__es__ Now , she had no idea what to look for .
__es__ This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
__es__ Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
__es__ Had they consumed colored drinks ?
__es__ Did they eat fish and chips ?
__es__ Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
__es__ What time of life had they started school ?
__es__ And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
__es__ By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant .
__es__ Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
__es__ Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
__es__ It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
__es__ And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
__es__ Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 .
__es__ People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
__es__ In fact , she need not have hurried .
__es__ It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women .
__es__ The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
__es__ A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
__es__ Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
__es__ So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
__es__ So , how did she know that she was right ?
__es__ Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
__es__ She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
__es__ So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
__es__ Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
__es__ George frankly preferred numbers to people .
__es__ But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought disconfirmation .
__es__ Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
__es__ He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
__es__ Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
__es__ It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
__es__ I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
__es__ Alice and George were very good at conflict .
__es__ They saw it as thinking .
__es__ So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
__es__ Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
__es__ That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
__es__ That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
__es__ And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
__es__ Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
__es__ And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
__es__ Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
__es__ &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
__es__ But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
__es__ So how do organizations think ?
__es__ Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
__es__ And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
__es__ And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
__es__ In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
__es__ Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
__es__ Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
__es__ It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
__es__ They can &apos;t think together .
__es__ And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
__es__ So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
__es__ Because it does take skill and practice , too .
__es__ If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
__es__ So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
__es__ And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
__es__ He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
__es__ He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
__es__ But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
__es__ So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
__es__ After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
__es__ Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
__es__ But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
__es__ In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
__es__ And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
__es__ It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
__es__ So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
__es__ And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
__es__ Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
__es__ But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
__es__ And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
__es__ And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
__es__ They think of him as a leader .
__es__ So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
__es__ Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
__es__ I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
__es__ I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
__es__ The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
__es__ It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
__es__ But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
__es__ Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
__es__ But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
__es__ Openness isn &apos;t the end .
__es__ It &apos;s the beginning .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania .
__es__ I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
__es__ It was a simple machine that changed my life .
__es__ Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
__es__ I had never used a computer .
__es__ I had never seen an Internet .
__es__ On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
__es__ My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )
__es__ There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
__es__ But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
__es__ I would like to share that story today .
__es__ We have seven children in my family .
__es__ All sisters , excepting me .
__es__ This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
__es__ Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
__es__ Like everyone else , we grew maize .
__es__ One year our fortune turned very bad .
__es__ In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
__es__ Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
__es__ My family ate one meal per day , at night .
__es__ Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
__es__ The food passes through our bodies .
__es__ We drop down to nothing .
__es__ In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
__es__ Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
__es__ I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
__es__ It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
__es__ I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
__es__ So I went to a library .
__es__ I read books , science books , especially physics .
__es__ I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
__es__ I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
__es__ Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
__es__ It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
__es__ Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
__es__ So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
__es__ But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
__es__ Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
__es__ Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
__es__ It was one light at first .
__es__ And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
__es__ Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
__es__ Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
__es__ ( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
__es__ I had never seen an airplane before .
__es__ I had never slept in a hotel .
__es__ So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
__es__ So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
__es__ God bless .
__es__ Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
__es__ I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
__es__ Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
__es__ You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
__es__ And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
__es__ If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
__es__ And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
__es__ We would never do that in our own countries .
__es__ But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
__es__ This is happening to us today .
__es__ And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
__es__ And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
__es__ And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
__es__ If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
__es__ We have three main groups .
__es__ We have online criminals .
__es__ Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
__es__ And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
__es__ These guys make money .
__es__ They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
__es__ We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
__es__ Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
__es__ This is Alfred Gonzalez .
__es__ This is Stephen Watt .
__es__ This is Bjorn Sundin .
__es__ This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
__es__ These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
__es__ The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
__es__ Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
__es__ And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
__es__ And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
__es__ In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
__es__ The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
__es__ They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
__es__ Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
__es__ So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
__es__ And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
__es__ This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
__es__ DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
__es__ It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
__es__ Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
__es__ And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
__es__ And his answer was yes .
__es__ So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
__es__ Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
__es__ They sell certificates .
__es__ What do you do with certificates ?
__es__ Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
__es__ Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
__es__ Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
__es__ and issue rogue certificates .
__es__ And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
__es__ What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
__es__ Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
__es__ Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
__es__ They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
__es__ The company headquarters are right here .
__es__ So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
__es__ But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
__es__ For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
__es__ If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
__es__ But today , it goes beyond that .
__es__ They will tap your Internet connection .
__es__ They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
__es__ Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
__es__ Why should I worry ?
__es__ Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
__es__ Privacy is implied .
__es__ Privacy is not up for discussion .
__es__ This is not a question between privacy against security .
__es__ It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
__es__ And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
__es__ And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
__es__ And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
__es__ We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
__es__ It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
__es__ This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
__es__ Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
__es__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__es__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__es__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__es__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__es__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__es__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__es__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__es__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__es__ But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
__es__ Values are a certain kind of fact .
__es__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__es__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__es__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__es__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__es__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__es__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__es__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__es__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__es__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__es__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
__es__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__es__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__es__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__es__ Probably not .
__es__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__es__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__es__ And morality relates to these truths .
__es__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__es__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__es__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__es__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__es__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__es__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__es__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__es__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__es__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__es__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__es__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__es__ And these await our discovery .
__es__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__es__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__es__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__es__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__es__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__es__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
__es__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__es__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__es__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__es__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__es__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__es__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__es__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__es__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
__es__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__es__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__es__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__es__ As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
__es__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__es__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__es__ There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__es__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
__es__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__es__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__es__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__es__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__es__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__es__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__es__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__es__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
__es__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__es__ Why would we think this ?
__es__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__es__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__es__ But it clearly admits some exceptions .
__es__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__es__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__es__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__es__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__es__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__es__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__es__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__es__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__es__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
__es__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__es__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
__es__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__es__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__es__ Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__es__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__es__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__es__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__es__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__es__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__es__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__es__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__es__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__es__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
__es__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__es__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__es__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__es__ But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__es__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__es__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__es__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__es__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__es__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
__es__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
__es__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__es__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__es__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__es__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__es__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__es__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__es__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
__es__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__es__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__es__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__es__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__es__ But this is just the point .
__es__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__es__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__es__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__es__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__es__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__es__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__es__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__es__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__es__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__es__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__es__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__es__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__es__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__es__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__es__ It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__es__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__es__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__es__ Thank you very much .
__es__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
__es__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__es__ Language seems to be really important here .
__es__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__es__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__es__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__es__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
__es__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__es__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__es__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
__es__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__es__ But can you reconcile that ?
__es__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__es__ Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__es__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__es__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__es__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__es__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__es__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__es__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__es__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__es__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__es__ SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
__es__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__es__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__es__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__es__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__es__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__es__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
__es__ A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
__es__ This one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her Broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
__es__ And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
__es__ And after a few moments , her therapist tries a new tack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she sings , in one descending scale , she sings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
__es__ And it &apos;s a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
__es__ Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug , one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
__es__ Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .
__es__ And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
__es__ When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
__es__ and how late-stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
__es__ But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
__es__ I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
__es__ I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes , these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with disfiguring cancers .
__es__ I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor , that doctor without borders .
__es__ On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
__es__ Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
__es__ It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
__es__ And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
__es__ And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic .
__es__ It was my first audition , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
__es__ And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra , to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
__es__ But a year later , I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician .
__es__ Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard , but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s , was treated with thorazine at Bellevue , and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later .
__es__ Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The Soloist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
__es__ And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
__es__ Playing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
__es__ I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
__es__ And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill .
__es__ But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
__es__ There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
__es__ And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel , I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony , bringing the light of music into the very darkest places , performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row , performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane .
__es__ After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
__es__ Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the footlights , out of the tuxedo tails , the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
__es__ Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
__es__ Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
__es__ The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brahms , or chamber music by Beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
__es__ And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
__es__ And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
__es__ I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Keats , the Romantic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
__es__ Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
__es__ And Keats said , &quot; &quot; Beauty is truth , and truth beauty .
__es__ That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
__es__ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
__es__ I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
__es__ I have not slept in weeks .
__es__ Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
__es__ Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
__es__ So I would walk around in a daze during the day .
__es__ I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
__es__ In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
__es__ Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
__es__ My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
__es__ And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
__es__ But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
__es__ And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
__es__ Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
__es__ And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
__es__ This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
__es__ How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
__es__ And so we started talking about this .
__es__ And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
__es__ All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
__es__ But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
__es__ And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
__es__ So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
__es__ And the idea was to put McSweeney &apos;s — McSweeney &apos;s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
__es__ It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
__es__ We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
__es__ So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
__es__ You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
__es__ So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this mural , that &apos;s a Chris Ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
__es__ So we rented this space .
__es__ And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
__es__ You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
__es__ You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
__es__ It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
__es__ We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look — while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
__es__ And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
__es__ Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
__es__ You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
__es__ A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate supply-like .
__es__ Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
__es__ We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
__es__ Up at the top , you see the eyepatch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch , and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mitzvahs and whatever .
__es__ So we opened this place . And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
__es__ This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
__es__ These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Practical Joking with Pirates . &quot;
__es__ While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
__es__ That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
__es__ It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
__es__ So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
__es__ The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
__es__ We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
__es__ We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
__es__ I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle .
__es__ Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
__es__ It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
__es__ And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
__es__ And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
__es__ And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
__es__ And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
__es__ And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari , a longtime San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
__es__ She took over as executive director .
__es__ Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
__es__ And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
__es__ The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
__es__ You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
__es__ And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
__es__ They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored .
__es__ So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
__es__ And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
__es__ If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
__es__ But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
__es__ And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
__es__ Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
__es__ First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
__es__ And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
__es__ And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
__es__ And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
__es__ They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
__es__ So there &apos;s no stigma .
__es__ They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
__es__ They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
__es__ These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
__es__ They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
__es__ There &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at McSweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
__es__ But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
__es__ They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
__es__ They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
__es__ And that makes a happy family .
__es__ A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
__es__ A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
__es__ So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
__es__ So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
__es__ And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster .
__es__ And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
__es__ The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
__es__ So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
__es__ Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
__es__ So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
__es__ This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
__es__ You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
__es__ So this is one of the books that they do .
__es__ Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic . &quot;
__es__ And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
__es__ So then we still had more tutors to use .
__es__ This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
__es__ The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
__es__ We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
__es__ The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
__es__ The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
__es__ Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
__es__ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
__es__ We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
__es__ Whoever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
__es__ The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
__es__ They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
__es__ And that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
__es__ So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
__es__ Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Everett Middle School Writers &apos; Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
__es__ It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
__es__ This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight-Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages — English and Spanish .
__es__ So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
__es__ I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
__es__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
__es__ She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
__es__ She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
__es__ It &apos;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
__es__ I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
__es__ We had a big party at the end .
__es__ This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
__es__ You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
__es__ And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
__es__ Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
__es__ The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
__es__ And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
__es__ It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
__es__ And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
__es__ We sell all the student books .
__es__ Where else would you put them , right ?
__es__ So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money .
__es__ So it was paying the rent .
__es__ And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
__es__ But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
__es__ It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
__es__ There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
__es__ And it became a gateway to the community .
__es__ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
__es__ What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
__es__ They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
__es__ And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
__es__ This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
__es__ So the store actually did really well .
__es__ But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
__es__ It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
__es__ So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
__es__ So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
__es__ And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
__es__ They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
__es__ They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
__es__ So , knowing the crime-fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company .
__es__ This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
__es__ And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
__es__ So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Costco for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
__es__ These are all handmade .
__es__ These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
__es__ All the packaging is done by Sam Potts .
__es__ So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
__es__ This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
__es__ Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
__es__ Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
__es__ These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
__es__ This is a secret identity kit .
__es__ If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Hoboken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
__es__ So , this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
__es__ There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that .
__es__ So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
__es__ You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
__es__ It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
__es__ But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
__es__ All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
__es__ I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
__es__ It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
__es__ And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
__es__ So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
__es__ It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
__es__ This is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
__es__ You can read this quote .
__es__ Addicted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
__es__ Came in . Got this concentrated attention .
__es__ And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
__es__ So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
__es__ It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
__es__ So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
__es__ He &apos;s now been published in five books .
__es__ He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super-Has-Beens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Penguin Balboa , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
__es__ And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
__es__ He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
__es__ There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
__es__ So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
__es__ This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers .
__es__ So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-Eleven would be .
__es__ Leeches . Mammoth chunks . They even have their own Slurpee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Order . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
__es__ These are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pittsfield , Massachusetts ; Ink Spot in Cincinnati ; Youth Speaks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin Bat Cave in Austin ; Fighting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Roddy Doyle , this will be open in April .
__es__ Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
__es__ All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
__es__ Profound leaps forward !
__es__ And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
__es__ I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
__es__ I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
__es__ We created a website .
__es__ I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
__es__ We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
__es__ Always let the teachers lead the way .
__es__ They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
__es__ There are a million ways .
__es__ You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
__es__ So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
__es__ This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
__es__ This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
__es__ Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
__es__ If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
__es__ You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
__es__ And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
__es__ And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureaucratically untenable .
__es__ You can do and use the skills that you have .
__es__ The schools need you . The teachers need you .
__es__ Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
__es__ Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
__es__ You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
__es__ Thank you so much .
__es__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
__es__ And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
__es__ And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day .
__es__ And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hallelujah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
__es__ My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
__es__ But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
__es__ I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
__es__ And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laughed .
__es__ And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
__es__ And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
__es__ Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
__es__ My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
__es__ It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
__es__ That ’ s a big thing in California .
__es__ And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
__es__ And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
__es__ And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
__es__ You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
__es__ Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
__es__ And so I argued with people about that , I argued and I argued .
__es__ I called my parents up .
__es__ I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
__es__ They ’ re back in Philadelphia .
__es__ And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mothers are like that .
__es__ And so , on my 27th birthday I decided , because I argued so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
__es__ And so I did .
__es__ I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
__es__ And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
__es__ And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
__es__ Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
__es__ And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
__es__ And then I would launch in .
__es__ Well , that just ended communication .
__es__ So on this first day I actually listened .
__es__ And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
__es__ I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
__es__ I didn ’ t .
__es__ And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
__es__ So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
__es__ Well , that lasted 17 years .
__es__ Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
__es__ And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
__es__ I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
__es__ It ’ s only 500 miles .
__es__ And I went into the Registrar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
__es__ I had a newspaper clipping .
__es__ &quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
__es__ You don ’ t … ?
__es__ We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
__es__ And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
__es__ And my father came out , he was so proud .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor ’ s degree ?
__es__ You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
__es__ I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana .
__es__ I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
__es__ I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
__es__ There are two stories in Montana .
__es__ The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
__es__ And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Register for one credit .
__es__ You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , South America .
__es__ So I did that .
__es__ He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate — you ’ re matriculating , so you can use the library .
__es__ And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
__es__ They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
__es__ But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
__es__ They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
__es__ And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
__es__ I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
__es__ I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
__es__ All the students sat around and they went ...
__es__ ( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
__es__ They had to take that class with me .
__es__ Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
__es__ And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
__es__ and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
__es__ &quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a handsaw . &quot;
__es__ &quot; Well , you can ’ t clearcut with a ... &quot;
__es__ &quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
__es__ &quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about selective forestry . &quot;
__es__ Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
__es__ I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
__es__ But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
__es__ And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
__es__ And so I went on .
__es__ My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
__es__ What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hunched my shoulder , I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin .
__es__ I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
__es__ No one was interested in oil spills .
__es__ But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
__es__ And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
__es__ My dad came out again .
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
__es__ My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
__es__ I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
__es__ And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
__es__ And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
__es__ And I ’ m thanking you , and I &apos;m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
__es__ And that ’ s communication .
__es__ And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
__es__ And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
__es__ Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
__es__ Well , my journey kept going on .
__es__ My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
__es__ I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
__es__ I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
__es__ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
__es__ &quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
__es__ He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
__es__ How could that be , how could that be ?
__es__ How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
__es__ Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
__es__ And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
__es__ And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
__es__ I started talking because I had studied environment .
__es__ I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
__es__ And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
__es__ And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
__es__ Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
__es__ And so that ’ s the message that I had .
__es__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
__es__ This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motorized vehicles .
__es__ I was walking through El Dorado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in Venezuela , and I don ’ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
__es__ There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; Pasaporte , pasaporte , &quot; &quot; and with an M16 pointed at me .
__es__ And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
__es__ I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
__es__ I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
__es__ What possessed me to say this thing ?
__es__ The road turned into the jungle .
__es__ I didn ’ t get shot .
__es__ And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Almighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
__es__ It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
__es__ I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
__es__ The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
__es__ Now how could that be ?
__es__ Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
__es__ But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
__es__ I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador .
__es__ I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
__es__ And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
__es__ You know , we can do it .
__es__ I was going to have to change .
__es__ And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
__es__ I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
__es__ I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
__es__ But I know I needed to .
__es__ I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
__es__ And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
__es__ And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
__es__ And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
__es__ We have to change now .
__es__ As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists .
__es__ So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
__es__ And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
__es__ So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
__es__ Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
__es__ So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the latest episode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — longest running soap opera , which is cricket .
__es__ And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
__es__ It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue .
__es__ And like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
__es__ And that &apos;s exactly what cricket has done .
__es__ It &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20-over game .
__es__ And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
__es__ But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
__es__ Cricket wasn &apos;t always this speed-driven generations game .
__es__ There was a time when you played cricket , you played timeless test matches , when you played on till the game got over .
__es__ And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March .
__es__ And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town , which is a two-hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
__es__ So , the match was ended in between .
__es__ And one of the English batsmen said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__es__ Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
__es__ There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days , so you don &apos;t play on Sundays . And one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
__es__ But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket : because we had about the same pace of life .
__es__ ( Laughter ) The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
__es__ You fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
__es__ And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
__es__ The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
__es__ Princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers .
__es__ But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
__es__ Take a look : You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
__es__ ( Laughter ) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges — that &apos;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time .
__es__ Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
__es__ ( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
__es__ But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
__es__ You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket .
__es__ And then an enormous accident took place .
__es__ In Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
__es__ And we won this World Cup in 1983 .
__es__ And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game , and we played it virtually every day .
__es__ There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere .
__es__ But there was another big date .
__es__ 1983 was when we won the World Cup .
__es__ 1991 , &apos; 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
__es__ And so we allowed multinationals into India .
__es__ We cut customs duties , we reduced import duties , and we got all the multinationals coming in , with multinational budgets , who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
__es__ And there are only two vehicles in India — one real , one scripted .
__es__ The scripted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cricket .
__es__ And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
__es__ And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
__es__ And so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in .
__es__ Television started covering cricket . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
__es__ The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
__es__ And then another big accident happened in our cricket .
__es__ England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
__es__ Thank God for them .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see .
__es__ India didn &apos;t want to play the T20 World Cup .
__es__ But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin .
__es__ And then something very dramatic happened .
__es__ We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
__es__ ( Crowd cheering ) The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder .
__es__ Announcer : And Zishan takes it ! India wins !
__es__ What a match for a Twenty20 final .
__es__ India , the world champions .
__es__ ( Cheering ) India , T20 champions .
__es__ But what a game we had , M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air , but Misbah-ul-Haq , what a player .
__es__ A massive , massive success : India , the world TT champions .
__es__ Harsha Bhogle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket .
__es__ The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast .
__es__ ( Laughter ) If he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
__es__ And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
__es__ It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
__es__ And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
__es__ And thankfully for all of us , the English are very good at inventing things , and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And so England invented T20 cricket , and allowed India to hijack it .
__es__ It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
__es__ ( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T20 league .
__es__ Six weeks , city versus city .
__es__ It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
__es__ One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
__es__ The other was Indian cricket .
__es__ Now , suddenly we had to support city leagues .
__es__ But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West .
__es__ America is a home of leagues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some glitzy leagues here in India . &quot;
__es__ But was India ready for it ?
__es__ Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized .
__es__ It was never promoted , it was never sold — it was organized .
__es__ And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
__es__ All of a sudden , you had that happening .
__es__ ( Music ) An opening ceremony to match every other .
__es__ This was an India that was buying Corvettes . This was an India that was buying Jaguar .
__es__ This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand &apos;s population twice over .
__es__ So , it was a different India .
__es__ But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
__es__ And so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .
__es__ Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
__es__ ( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes .
__es__ They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
__es__ And so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time .
__es__ And they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
__es__ I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues .
__es__ But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized .
__es__ So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Manchester United style promotion , but very Mumbai style promotion . Take a look .
__es__ ( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .
__es__ All along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .
__es__ Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot — if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn &apos;t go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad .
__es__ This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
__es__ And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
__es__ So , the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago , overnight . And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X. &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Fine , you play to date X , minus one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game ,
__es__ went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet — first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time .
__es__ ( Laughter ) Never would India have thought on this scale before .
__es__ Never would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
__es__ We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
__es__ There is cricket and the movies .
__es__ And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs .
__es__ And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta .
__es__ They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .
__es__ And something very interesting happened .
__es__ We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket .
__es__ And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more .
__es__ And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that follows — if you did well , you got a hug from Preity Zinta .
__es__ So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching Preity Zinta .
__es__ ( Music ) And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd .
__es__ We &apos;d all seen matches in Kolkata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Shah Rukh , with the Bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata — not for India , but for Kolkata .
__es__ But take a look at this .
__es__ ( Music ) An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they &apos;d won in Kolkata .
__es__ Can you imagine ?
__es__ And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said ?
__es__ ( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta &apos;s team . &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pakistan in here .
__es__ I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
__es__ We can play cricket together , we can be friends .
__es__ So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
__es__ ( Applause ) There was criticism too because they said , &quot; &quot; Players are being bought and sold ?
__es__ Are they grain ?
__es__ Are they cattle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auction , you see .
__es__ How do you fix a price for a player ?
__es__ And so the auction that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so-and-so player . &quot;
__es__ There it is .
__es__ ( Music ) Auctioneer : Going at 1,500,000 dollars . Chennai .
__es__ Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars .
__es__ HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day — so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
__es__ The best Indian players who played every test match — every one of the internationals , the top of the line players — standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year .
__es__ Now they were getting 500,000 for six days &apos; work .
__es__ Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , and I &apos;m earning more than the footballers , wow . &quot; &quot; And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India .
__es__ Could you have imagined that day would come ?
__es__ One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
__es__ That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
__es__ So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
__es__ What India was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
__es__ Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today .
__es__ IPL became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .
__es__ Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks .
__es__ But we did it . You know why ?
__es__ Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
__es__ ( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching — the huge consuming class — everybody came to watch the cricket .
__es__ We &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in India , which is a pity , but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
__es__ Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
__es__ For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beggars , snake charmers , filth , Delhi belly — people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .
__es__ And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
__es__ Cricketers all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
__es__ And that felt good , you know ?
__es__ We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Delhi belly in there anymore .
__es__ There &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules .
__es__ Right so , finally , an English game that India usurped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
__es__ If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
__es__ You can &apos;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
__es__ So that &apos;s what T20 is doing .
__es__ Hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
__es__ Thank you very much . Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__es__ So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
__es__ And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street .
__es__ This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
__es__ Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
__es__ So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
__es__ They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
__es__ Blocks have names .
__es__ Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
__es__ All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
__es__ And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
__es__ There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
__es__ The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
__es__ The second house ever built is house number two .
__es__ Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
__es__ So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
__es__ So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
__es__ ( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
__es__ But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
__es__ So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
__es__ And this map is also accurate .
__es__ ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
__es__ So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
__es__ Domo arigato gozaimashita .
__es__ Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
__es__ And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
__es__ That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
__es__ As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
__es__ After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
__es__ In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
__es__ And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
__es__ And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
__es__ Take nothing : do no harm .
__es__ I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
__es__ Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
__es__ And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
__es__ And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
__es__ They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
__es__ From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
__es__ Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
__es__ And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
__es__ But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
__es__ According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
__es__ That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
__es__ And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
__es__ So the equation is conceptual .
__es__ Still it works to help us understand the problem .
__es__ So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
__es__ Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
__es__ I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
__es__ Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
__es__ So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T2 — where it reduces impact ?
__es__ I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
__es__ Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
__es__ Linear : take , make , waste .
__es__ Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
__es__ Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
__es__ More carpet per man-hour .
__es__ Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
__es__ In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
__es__ And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
__es__ And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
__es__ We have measured our progress very rigorously .
__es__ So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
__es__ Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
__es__ ( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
__es__ So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
__es__ This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
__es__ Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
__es__ The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
__es__ Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
__es__ Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
__es__ Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
__es__ Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
__es__ We have diverted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
__es__ Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
__es__ We call it Cool Carpet .
__es__ And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
__es__ Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
__es__ You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
__es__ It is practical , and pretty too .
__es__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
__es__ We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
__es__ We call this Mission Zero .
__es__ And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
__es__ A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
__es__ Here is the business case for sustainability .
__es__ From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
__es__ This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
__es__ And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
__es__ Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
__es__ Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
__es__ You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
__es__ And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
__es__ No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
__es__ Costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
__es__ It is a better business model .
__es__ And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
__es__ There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
__es__ But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
__es__ We literally gained market share .
__es__ We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
__es__ If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
__es__ I don &apos;t think so .
__es__ I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
__es__ That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
__es__ But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
__es__ And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
__es__ You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
__es__ But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
__es__ Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
__es__ At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
__es__ We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
__es__ And now the challenge is in execution .
__es__ And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
__es__ ( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
__es__ If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
__es__ And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
__es__ Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
__es__ Who is that person ?
__es__ Not you . Not I.
__es__ But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
__es__ And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
__es__ On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
__es__ But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
__es__ He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
__es__ And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
__es__ Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
__es__ Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
__es__ Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
__es__ A wise friend introduced us two .
__es__ And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
__es__ Knowing you has changed my thinking .
__es__ For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
__es__ Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
__es__ Begin , I will .
__es__ The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
__es__ We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
__es__ The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
__es__ And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
__es__ For you , it &apos;s your call .
__es__ Thank you .
__es__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
__pt-br__ My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
__pt-br__ There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
__pt-br__ A morning that I will never forget .
__pt-br__ A real school .
__pt-br__ You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
__pt-br__ So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
__pt-br__ It was the only way we both could be educated .
__pt-br__ Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
__pt-br__ We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
__pt-br__ The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
__pt-br__ It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
__pt-br__ We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
__pt-br__ From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
__pt-br__ We always wondered what they knew about us .
__pt-br__ Were we being followed ?
__pt-br__ Do they know where we live ?
__pt-br__ We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
__pt-br__ I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
__pt-br__ My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
__pt-br__ A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
__pt-br__ But my educated mother became a teacher .
__pt-br__ There she is .
__pt-br__ She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
__pt-br__ And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
__pt-br__ There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
__pt-br__ To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
__pt-br__ During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
__pt-br__ I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
__pt-br__ Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
__pt-br__ But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
__pt-br__ So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
__pt-br__ I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
__pt-br__ Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
__pt-br__ Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
__pt-br__ He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) My family believes in me .
__pt-br__ I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
__pt-br__ The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
__pt-br__ And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
__pt-br__ Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
__pt-br__ Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
__pt-br__ As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
__pt-br__ In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
__pt-br__ Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
__pt-br__ But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
__pt-br__ I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
__pt-br__ I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
__pt-br__ But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
__pt-br__ To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
__pt-br__ Like me , they are dreaming big .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ And you &apos;ll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
__pt-br__ And slightly more complex things appear .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
__pt-br__ And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
__pt-br__ But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
__pt-br__ Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
__pt-br__ Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
__pt-br__ We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
__pt-br__ How old are you ? What do you do ?
__pt-br__ Then we get more personal with it .
__pt-br__ Have you ever had any diseases ?
__pt-br__ Have you ever been divorced ?
__pt-br__ Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
__pt-br__ What are you into ? Who are you into ?
__pt-br__ What gender do you like to sleep with ?
__pt-br__ I get it .
__pt-br__ We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
__pt-br__ We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
__pt-br__ We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
__pt-br__ We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
__pt-br__ Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
__pt-br__ Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
__pt-br__ The boxes are too narrow .
__pt-br__ And this can get really dangerous .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
__pt-br__ I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
__pt-br__ I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
__pt-br__ I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
__pt-br__ Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
__pt-br__ So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
__pt-br__ I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
__pt-br__ They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
__pt-br__ So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
__pt-br__ When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
__pt-br__ I kept up the charade for eight years .
__pt-br__ So this is me when I was 11 .
__pt-br__ I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
__pt-br__ See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
__pt-br__ In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
__pt-br__ Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
__pt-br__ When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
__pt-br__ At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
__pt-br__ I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
__pt-br__ I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
__pt-br__ If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
__pt-br__ But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
__pt-br__ Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
__pt-br__ When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
__pt-br__ No one is exactly shocked .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
__pt-br__ When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
__pt-br__ Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
__pt-br__ See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
__pt-br__ I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
__pt-br__ So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
__pt-br__ And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
__pt-br__ But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
__pt-br__ And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
__pt-br__ And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
__pt-br__ If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
__pt-br__ At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
__pt-br__ I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines — girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
__pt-br__ I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
__pt-br__ And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
__pt-br__ I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
__pt-br__ I was not an activist .
__pt-br__ I wave no flags in my own life .
__pt-br__ But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
__pt-br__ How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
__pt-br__ Were we even a group ? What group ?
__pt-br__ And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
__pt-br__ Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
__pt-br__ And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
__pt-br__ It might give them pause .
__pt-br__ Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
__pt-br__ Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
__pt-br__ For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
__pt-br__ Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
__pt-br__ So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
__pt-br__ And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
__pt-br__ So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
__pt-br__ And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
__pt-br__ And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
__pt-br__ And then we made this .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) Video : I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
__pt-br__ Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
__pt-br__ My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
__pt-br__ My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
__pt-br__ It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
__pt-br__ We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
__pt-br__ There is no equality in the United States .
__pt-br__ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Marriage &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Freedom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
__pt-br__ The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
__pt-br__ Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
__pt-br__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
__pt-br__ So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
__pt-br__ And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
__pt-br__ I want to take the project across the country .
__pt-br__ I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
__pt-br__ This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
__pt-br__ I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Self evident truths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) iO Tillett Wright : Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
__pt-br__ Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
__pt-br__ And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
__pt-br__ So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
__pt-br__ That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
__pt-br__ I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
__pt-br__ Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
__pt-br__ So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
__pt-br__ Visibility really is key .
__pt-br__ Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
__pt-br__ Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
__pt-br__ Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
__pt-br__ Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
__pt-br__ But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
__pt-br__ In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
__pt-br__ It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
__pt-br__ It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
__pt-br__ At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; gays &quot; &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
__pt-br__ Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
__pt-br__ At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
__pt-br__ And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
__pt-br__ Can you quantify your openness ?
__pt-br__ Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
__pt-br__ Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
__pt-br__ I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; &quot; Grey . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
__pt-br__ And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
__pt-br__ The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
__pt-br__ And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
__pt-br__ Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
__pt-br__ Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
__pt-br__ Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
__pt-br__ Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
__pt-br__ Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
__pt-br__ After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
__pt-br__ Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
__pt-br__ So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
__pt-br__ Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
__pt-br__ Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
__pt-br__ What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
__pt-br__ And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
__pt-br__ At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
__pt-br__ So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
__pt-br__ Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s too late .
__pt-br__ Because I already am all of those things .
__pt-br__ We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
__pt-br__ So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
__pt-br__ The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
__pt-br__ I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
__pt-br__ I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
__pt-br__ Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
__pt-br__ When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
__pt-br__ As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
__pt-br__ I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
__pt-br__ For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
__pt-br__ Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
__pt-br__ We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
__pt-br__ After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
__pt-br__ It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
__pt-br__ Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
__pt-br__ Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
__pt-br__ Some I even considered like my second home .
__pt-br__ But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
__pt-br__ A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
__pt-br__ A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
__pt-br__ That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
__pt-br__ Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
__pt-br__ Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
__pt-br__ Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
__pt-br__ Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
__pt-br__ Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
__pt-br__ In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
__pt-br__ This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
__pt-br__ Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
__pt-br__ Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
__pt-br__ There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
__pt-br__ So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
__pt-br__ Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
__pt-br__ Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
__pt-br__ I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
__pt-br__ I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
__pt-br__ I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
__pt-br__ I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
__pt-br__ As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
__pt-br__ In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
__pt-br__ The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
__pt-br__ How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
__pt-br__ Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
__pt-br__ They have nothing to compare it to .
__pt-br__ When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
__pt-br__ I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
__pt-br__ Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
__pt-br__ In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
__pt-br__ They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
__pt-br__ This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
__pt-br__ It was more like a restaurant .
__pt-br__ Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
__pt-br__ Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
__pt-br__ Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
__pt-br__ The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
__pt-br__ Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
__pt-br__ I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
__pt-br__ There were no back doors .
__pt-br__ There were no windows large enough to climb through .
__pt-br__ These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
__pt-br__ Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
__pt-br__ Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
__pt-br__ The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
__pt-br__ I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
__pt-br__ This is a family portrait .
__pt-br__ The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
__pt-br__ They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
__pt-br__ My interpreter told me their stories .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
__pt-br__ When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
__pt-br__ I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
__pt-br__ Wrong . They were all enslaved .
__pt-br__ Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
__pt-br__ This young child is eight years old .
__pt-br__ He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
__pt-br__ He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
__pt-br__ The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
__pt-br__ Many of them drown .
__pt-br__ For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
__pt-br__ Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
__pt-br__ I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
__pt-br__ in the cold , windy night .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
__pt-br__ I want to introduce you to Kofi .
__pt-br__ Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
__pt-br__ I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
__pt-br__ Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
__pt-br__ Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
__pt-br__ Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
__pt-br__ Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
__pt-br__ He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
__pt-br__ At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
__pt-br__ Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
__pt-br__ After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
__pt-br__ Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
__pt-br__ Mercury is used in the extraction process .
__pt-br__ These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
__pt-br__ When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
__pt-br__ I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
__pt-br__ The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
__pt-br__ At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
__pt-br__ All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
__pt-br__ In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
__pt-br__ This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
__pt-br__ When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
__pt-br__ When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
__pt-br__ On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
__pt-br__ Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
__pt-br__ I want to shine a light on slavery .
__pt-br__ When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
__pt-br__ They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
__pt-br__ I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
__pt-br__ I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
__pt-br__ These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
__pt-br__ There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
__pt-br__ I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .

__pt-br__ The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
__pt-br__ But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
__pt-br__ Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
__pt-br__ So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
__pt-br__ These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
__pt-br__ In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban .
__pt-br__ And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
__pt-br__ And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
__pt-br__ Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
__pt-br__ At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
__pt-br__ So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
__pt-br__ We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
__pt-br__ This is our group , our main group of weavers .
__pt-br__ They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
__pt-br__ They all have bank accounts .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
__pt-br__ This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
__pt-br__ And the rest says it all .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .

__pt-br__ In an age of global strife and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so damn good ?
__pt-br__ If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s my clock .
__pt-br__ It uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
__pt-br__ Now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
__pt-br__ So in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
__pt-br__ At noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
__pt-br__ Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
__pt-br__ So , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
__pt-br__ However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
__pt-br__ In each shot glass is a different scented oil .
__pt-br__ In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
__pt-br__ This will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
__pt-br__ So during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
__pt-br__ Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
__pt-br__ You can see why I hate Chris .
__pt-br__ One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
__pt-br__ This problem &apos;s been bugging me for well over a decade .
__pt-br__ All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
__pt-br__ Many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
__pt-br__ And when she said this , I had an epiphany .
__pt-br__ So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
__pt-br__ To do this , I devised something called the five senses graph .
__pt-br__ Along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
__pt-br__ Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s a quick video to show you how it works .
__pt-br__ Bike designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , custom bike designer .
__pt-br__ ( Motorcyle revving ) &#91; Sound &#93; &#91; Touch &#93; &#91; Sight &#93; &#91; Smell &#93; &#91; Taste &#93; JL : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
__pt-br__ So here are some other results .
__pt-br__ The first is for instant noodles .
__pt-br__ Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
__pt-br__ You know . ( Slurps ) Needless to say , I no longer dine with these people .
__pt-br__ OK , next , clubbing .
__pt-br__ These people I still do hang out with .
__pt-br__ All right , and smoking .
__pt-br__ Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
__pt-br__ OK . Now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
__pt-br__ It would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
__pt-br__ Now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
__pt-br__ In fact , in the years that I gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
__pt-br__ That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
__pt-br__ Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
__pt-br__ So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
__pt-br__ Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
__pt-br__ And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
__pt-br__ You see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
__pt-br__ In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
__pt-br__ You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
__pt-br__ Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
__pt-br__ So what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
__pt-br__ We could call this &quot; &quot; the perfumator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
__pt-br__ So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your toothbrush ?
__pt-br__ Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
__pt-br__ Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
__pt-br__ Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
__pt-br__ Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
__pt-br__ Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
__pt-br__ Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
__pt-br__ Oh , one last thing before I leave .
__pt-br__ And the best way to do that is with free candy .
__pt-br__ You guys ready ?
__pt-br__ All right .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ ( Arabic ) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan . In the Name of Allah , the most Gracious , the most Merciful .
__pt-br__ My mother had 16 pregnancies .
__pt-br__ From 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
__pt-br__ You can imagine as a child what I went through .
__pt-br__ I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
__pt-br__ So as a result , my father sent me to America .
__pt-br__ I came to America .
__pt-br__ While I was completing my education , my country was invaded by Russia .
__pt-br__ My family was in a refugee camp .
__pt-br__ So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
__pt-br__ I could live with them .
__pt-br__ But I wasn &apos;t happy .
__pt-br__ At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
__pt-br__ So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
__pt-br__ How am I going to do that ?
__pt-br__ I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
__pt-br__ He was 80 years old .
__pt-br__ They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
__pt-br__ And by that time , the women are yelling and screaming inside the car .
__pt-br__ No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
__pt-br__ Today , they are the best trainers .
__pt-br__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__pt-br__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__pt-br__ Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
__pt-br__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__pt-br__ They kill our livestock .
__pt-br__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__pt-br__ My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__pt-br__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__pt-br__ The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__pt-br__ So they kill the lions .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__pt-br__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__pt-br__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__pt-br__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__pt-br__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__pt-br__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
__pt-br__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__pt-br__ And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
__pt-br__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
__pt-br__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__pt-br__ So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__pt-br__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__pt-br__ So I had an idea .
__pt-br__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
__pt-br__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__pt-br__ So I set up everything .
__pt-br__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
__pt-br__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__pt-br__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__pt-br__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__pt-br__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__pt-br__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__pt-br__ One of them was this grandmother .
__pt-br__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__pt-br__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__pt-br__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__pt-br__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__pt-br__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__pt-br__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__pt-br__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__pt-br__ And here I am today .
__pt-br__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__pt-br__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__pt-br__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__pt-br__ Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__pt-br__ So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
__pt-br__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__pt-br__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
__pt-br__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
__pt-br__ Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
__pt-br__ Disappears right into the background .
__pt-br__ So , he &apos;s bluffing . Let &apos;s do it backwards .
__pt-br__ One , two , three .
__pt-br__ Server : May I help you , sir ?
__pt-br__ Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .
__pt-br__ Server : We have pan seared registry error sprinkled with the finest corrupted data , binary brioche , RAM sandwiches , Conficker fitters , and a scripting salad with or without polymorphic dressing , and a grilled coding kabob .
__pt-br__ Customer : I &apos;d like a RAM sandwich and a glass of your finest Code 39 .
__pt-br__ Server : Would you like any desserts , sir ?
__pt-br__ Our special is tracking cookie .
__pt-br__ Customer : I &apos;d like a batch of some zombie tracking cookies , thank you .
__pt-br__ Server : Coming right up , sir .
__pt-br__ Your food will be served shortly .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
__pt-br__ I would find different fabrics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scarf or a hat , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for designs .
__pt-br__ I noticed when I wore my creations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And I thought , I can start my own business .
__pt-br__ Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
__pt-br__ I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
__pt-br__ Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like branding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
__pt-br__ Soon , my business really started to take off .
__pt-br__ Then one day , Forbes magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
__pt-br__ Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business eco-friendly ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
__pt-br__ My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment .
__pt-br__ I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
__pt-br__ For example , the grinding of materials , or the dumping of dried powder materials .
__pt-br__ These actions can pollute the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it .
__pt-br__ So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my items had to be eco-friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
__pt-br__ I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow .
__pt-br__ We live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
__pt-br__ It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
__pt-br__ That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
__pt-br__ Thank you , and peace and blessings .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : So , you heard Maya talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
__pt-br__ Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just — Ah !
__pt-br__ You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
__pt-br__ Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
__pt-br__ And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
__pt-br__ We go through initiation rites .
__pt-br__ We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
__pt-br__ But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
__pt-br__ And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
__pt-br__ All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
__pt-br__ And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
__pt-br__ Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
__pt-br__ And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
__pt-br__ The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
__pt-br__ And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
__pt-br__ No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
__pt-br__ And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
__pt-br__ When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
__pt-br__ Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
__pt-br__ A language is a flash of the human spirit .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
__pt-br__ Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
__pt-br__ And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
__pt-br__ What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
__pt-br__ And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
__pt-br__ And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
__pt-br__ And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
__pt-br__ Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
__pt-br__ Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
__pt-br__ Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
__pt-br__ They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
__pt-br__ And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
__pt-br__ They simply listen and then begin to speak .
__pt-br__ Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
__pt-br__ In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
__pt-br__ They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
__pt-br__ They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
__pt-br__ But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
__pt-br__ They speared each other .
__pt-br__ 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
__pt-br__ We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
__pt-br__ Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
__pt-br__ In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
__pt-br__ In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
__pt-br__ On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s interesting .
__pt-br__ If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
__pt-br__ Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
__pt-br__ But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
__pt-br__ So , the living give birth to the spirits .
__pt-br__ The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
__pt-br__ We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?
__pt-br__ So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
__pt-br__ Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
__pt-br__ Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
__pt-br__ In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
__pt-br__ To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
__pt-br__ The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
__pt-br__ And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
__pt-br__ And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
__pt-br__ It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
__pt-br__ Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
__pt-br__ Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
__pt-br__ Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
__pt-br__ Now , what does that mean ?
__pt-br__ It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
__pt-br__ Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
__pt-br__ I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
__pt-br__ That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
__pt-br__ Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
__pt-br__ This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
__pt-br__ What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
__pt-br__ This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__pt-br__ To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
__pt-br__ In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes — who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
__pt-br__ They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
__pt-br__ Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
__pt-br__ How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
__pt-br__ Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
__pt-br__ But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
__pt-br__ This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
__pt-br__ And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
__pt-br__ I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
__pt-br__ Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
__pt-br__ Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
__pt-br__ All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
__pt-br__ And the problem is not technology itself .
__pt-br__ The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
__pt-br__ Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
__pt-br__ to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
__pt-br__ Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
__pt-br__ You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
__pt-br__ And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
__pt-br__ I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
__pt-br__ This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
__pt-br__ That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
__pt-br__ His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
__pt-br__ His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
__pt-br__ He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
__pt-br__ The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
__pt-br__ One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
__pt-br__ The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
__pt-br__ And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
__pt-br__ Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
__pt-br__ The Neolithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago .
__pt-br__ The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
__pt-br__ Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
__pt-br__ When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
__pt-br__ This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
__pt-br__ The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
__pt-br__ This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
__pt-br__ The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
__pt-br__ Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
__pt-br__ The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
__pt-br__ So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
__pt-br__ He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
__pt-br__ He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
__pt-br__ He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
__pt-br__ Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
__pt-br__ The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
__pt-br__ An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
__pt-br__ And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
__pt-br__ They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
__pt-br__ So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
__pt-br__ We think that polemics — ( Applause ) — we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
__pt-br__ 156 nations carry our television channel .
__pt-br__ Our magazines are read by millions .
__pt-br__ And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__pt-br__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__pt-br__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
__pt-br__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__pt-br__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__pt-br__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__pt-br__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__pt-br__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__pt-br__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__pt-br__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
__pt-br__ We made this kindergarten to be a circle .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
__pt-br__ If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
__pt-br__ This is how the rooftop looks .
__pt-br__ And why did we design this ?
__pt-br__ The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a handrail . &quot;
__pt-br__ I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
__pt-br__ So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a handrail . &quot;
__pt-br__ But we could keep that idea around the trees .
__pt-br__ There are three trees popping through .
__pt-br__ And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
__pt-br__ But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
__pt-br__ They fall into the net .
__pt-br__ And you get more , and more , more .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
__pt-br__ The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
__pt-br__ It looks so nice from underneath .
__pt-br__ Monkeys in the zoo .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Feeding time .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
__pt-br__ And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
__pt-br__ And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
__pt-br__ You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
__pt-br__ But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he &apos;s putting water into his boots .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
__pt-br__ And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
__pt-br__ So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
__pt-br__ And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
__pt-br__ So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
__pt-br__ When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
__pt-br__ But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
__pt-br__ Because there is no boundary .
__pt-br__ And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
__pt-br__ He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
__pt-br__ But here , just they leave and come back .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a natural process .
__pt-br__ And secondly , we consider noise very important .
__pt-br__ You know that children sleep better in noise .
__pt-br__ They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
__pt-br__ And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
__pt-br__ And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
__pt-br__ They need noise .
__pt-br__ And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
__pt-br__ You are not supposed to be in silence .
__pt-br__ And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
__pt-br__ You know , it &apos;s completely open .
__pt-br__ And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
__pt-br__ In summer you go swimming .
__pt-br__ The sand is 50 degrees .
__pt-br__ You never melt in rain .
__pt-br__ So , children are supposed to be outside .
__pt-br__ So that is how we should treat them .
__pt-br__ This is how they divide classrooms .
__pt-br__ They don &apos;t .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
__pt-br__ A classroom .
__pt-br__ And a washbasin .
__pt-br__ They talk to each other around the well .
__pt-br__ And there are always some trees in the classroom .
__pt-br__ A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ And each classroom has at least one skylight .
__pt-br__ And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
__pt-br__ This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
__pt-br__ The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
__pt-br__ And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
__pt-br__ So you have to consider safety .
__pt-br__ So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
__pt-br__ They tried to go in .
__pt-br__ He hit his head .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
__pt-br__ He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
__pt-br__ And then we put other children .
__pt-br__ The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo , as you know .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
__pt-br__ Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
__pt-br__ And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
__pt-br__ This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
__pt-br__ Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
__pt-br__ And the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
__pt-br__ And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
__pt-br__ But the surprise is yet to come .
__pt-br__ The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
__pt-br__ And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
__pt-br__ The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
__pt-br__ Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
__pt-br__ They need to get some injury .
__pt-br__ And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
__pt-br__ I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
__pt-br__ And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
__pt-br__ They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
__pt-br__ So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
__pt-br__ Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
__pt-br__ Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
__pt-br__ And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
__pt-br__ And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big .
__pt-br__ So , how big ?
__pt-br__ Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
__pt-br__ It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
__pt-br__ And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
__pt-br__ Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
__pt-br__ But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
__pt-br__ They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
__pt-br__ And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
__pt-br__ might be answered by studying these systems .
__pt-br__ So that was very big .
__pt-br__ The second things is very hot .
__pt-br__ Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
__pt-br__ This is in false color .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
__pt-br__ And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
__pt-br__ The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
__pt-br__ And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
__pt-br__ The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
__pt-br__ So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
__pt-br__ There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
__pt-br__ Third thing : probing the very small .
__pt-br__ Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
__pt-br__ Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
__pt-br__ You were lied to .
__pt-br__ Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
__pt-br__ Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
__pt-br__ And dark matter is no exception .
__pt-br__ Well , how do we do this ?
__pt-br__ To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
__pt-br__ Here is an image .
__pt-br__ Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
__pt-br__ They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
__pt-br__ The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
__pt-br__ And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
__pt-br__ So , it &apos;s very funny .
__pt-br__ The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
__pt-br__ Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
__pt-br__ Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
__pt-br__ Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
__pt-br__ If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
__pt-br__ What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
__pt-br__ Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
__pt-br__ They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
__pt-br__ They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
__pt-br__ And , again , we want to learn more about it .
__pt-br__ So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
__pt-br__ Depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
__pt-br__ Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
__pt-br__ Here is a computer simulation .
__pt-br__ And we need a way to simplify it .
__pt-br__ Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
__pt-br__ If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
__pt-br__ The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
__pt-br__ Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
__pt-br__ So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
__pt-br__ I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
__pt-br__ Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
__pt-br__ He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
__pt-br__ And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
__pt-br__ They are not faster horses .
__pt-br__ They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
__pt-br__ So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
__pt-br__ And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
__pt-br__ At the time , I was cardiologist at UCLA , specializing in cardiac imaging techniques .
__pt-br__ The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__pt-br__ An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
__pt-br__ They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
__pt-br__ And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__pt-br__ And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
__pt-br__ Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
__pt-br__ Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad — I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory — learning about the significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wake-up call for me .
__pt-br__ So I started wondering , with all of these overlaps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian , or consult the veterinary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
__pt-br__ Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever attended a veterinary conference ?
__pt-br__ For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
__pt-br__ I mean , look , every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans .
__pt-br__ Every medication that we prescribe or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
__pt-br__ Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the nonurban .
__pt-br__ You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
__pt-br__ Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology .
__pt-br__ But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
__pt-br__ Physicians and scientists , we accept intellectually that our species , Homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
__pt-br__ But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
__pt-br__ I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook .
__pt-br__ I feel that tug of human exceptionalism , even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
__pt-br__ Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
__pt-br__ When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
__pt-br__ Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
__pt-br__ Fear-induced heart failure .
__pt-br__ Around the year 2000 , human cardiologists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
__pt-br__ It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life &apos;s savings with a roll of the dice , in a bride who &apos;d been left at the alter .
__pt-br__ But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
__pt-br__ Veterinarians had been diagnosing , treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos , from to deer to rabbits , since the 1970s .
__pt-br__ How many human lives might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.R. docs and cardiologists ?
__pt-br__ Self-injury .
__pt-br__ Some human patients harm themselves .
__pt-br__ Some pluck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
__pt-br__ Some animal patients also harm themselves .
__pt-br__ There are birds that pluck out feathers .
__pt-br__ There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
__pt-br__ But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-injury in their self-injuring animals .
__pt-br__ Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis .
__pt-br__ Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic .
__pt-br__ They may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
__pt-br__ Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally , a mare , soon after giving birth , will neglect the foal , refusing to nurse , and in some instances , kick the foal , even to death .
__pt-br__ But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
__pt-br__ Oxytocin is the bonding hormone , and this leads to renewed interest , on the part of the mare , in her foal .
__pt-br__ Shouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of ob / gyn &apos;s and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis ?
__pt-br__ Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large .
__pt-br__ To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laundry .
__pt-br__ Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not M.D. &apos; s .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
__pt-br__ Of course , most physicians don &apos;t realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , Homo sapiens , but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals , amphibians , reptiles , fish and birds .
__pt-br__ So I don &apos;t blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession &apos;s condescension and ignorance .
__pt-br__ But here &apos;s one from the vets : What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
__pt-br__ A physician . ( Laughter ) Closing the gap has become a passion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through programs like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA , where we &apos;re bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and our residents .
__pt-br__ And through Zoobiquity conferences , where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for collabortive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients .
__pt-br__ At Zoobiquity conferences , participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher ; how understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods ; and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high-strung Sheltie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school .
__pt-br__ In the United States and now internationally , at Zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
__pt-br__ After all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physicians to embrace our patients &apos; and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species-spanning approach to health .
__pt-br__ Because it turns out , some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren &apos;t human .
__pt-br__ And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and heal .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ Can geographic information make you healthy ?
__pt-br__ In 2001 I got hit by a train .
__pt-br__ My train was a heart attack .
__pt-br__ I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
__pt-br__ And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
__pt-br__ I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
__pt-br__ So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
__pt-br__ Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
__pt-br__ Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
__pt-br__ And you know why I understand that ?
__pt-br__ Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
__pt-br__ Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
__pt-br__ I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
__pt-br__ But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
__pt-br__ What does that mean , my environment ?
__pt-br__ Well , it can mean a lot of things .
__pt-br__ This is my life . These are my life places .
__pt-br__ We all have these .
__pt-br__ While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
__pt-br__ Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
__pt-br__ And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
__pt-br__ You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
__pt-br__ And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
__pt-br__ So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
__pt-br__ And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
__pt-br__ And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
__pt-br__ Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
__pt-br__ I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
__pt-br__ You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
__pt-br__ And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
__pt-br__ So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
__pt-br__ OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
__pt-br__ Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
__pt-br__ They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
__pt-br__ Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
__pt-br__ And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
__pt-br__ It was insidious and it was really happening .
__pt-br__ Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
__pt-br__ And I moved to Redlands California .
__pt-br__ Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
__pt-br__ Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
__pt-br__ Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
__pt-br__ So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
__pt-br__ Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
__pt-br__ The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
__pt-br__ No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
__pt-br__ They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
__pt-br__ They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
__pt-br__ Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
__pt-br__ This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
__pt-br__ Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
__pt-br__ Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
__pt-br__ So , how many people are in the white ?
__pt-br__ How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
__pt-br__ Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
__pt-br__ How many have spent it in the red places ?
__pt-br__ Oh , not so lucky .
__pt-br__ There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
__pt-br__ They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
__pt-br__ But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s not in yours either .
__pt-br__ So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
__pt-br__ And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
__pt-br__ And this is where he has spent most of his time .
__pt-br__ If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
__pt-br__ Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
__pt-br__ We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
__pt-br__ And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
__pt-br__ Did you know that data existed ?
__pt-br__ For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
__pt-br__ So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
__pt-br__ This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
__pt-br__ This might be what we end up with .
__pt-br__ This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
__pt-br__ This could be my little assessment .
__pt-br__ And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
__pt-br__ Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
__pt-br__ And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
__pt-br__ These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
__pt-br__ The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
__pt-br__ It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
__pt-br__ But it will also be useful for us .
__pt-br__ I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
__pt-br__ Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
__pt-br__ With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
__pt-br__ Just look at that for a minute .
__pt-br__ That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
__pt-br__ That was what he was talking about on that quote .
__pt-br__ And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
__pt-br__ So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
__pt-br__ And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
__pt-br__ When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
__pt-br__ But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
__pt-br__ After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
__pt-br__ It is not important if I like the job or not .
__pt-br__ But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
__pt-br__ That is me playing my imaginary piano .
__pt-br__ An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
__pt-br__ I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
__pt-br__ But no adults liked the idea .
__pt-br__ No adults believed I was serious .
__pt-br__ Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
__pt-br__ So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
__pt-br__ My dream would never come true .
__pt-br__ I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
__pt-br__ But that &apos;s so unfair .
__pt-br__ So I was determined to find another calling .
__pt-br__ Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
__pt-br__ I turned to books .
__pt-br__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
__pt-br__ Books banned in China , of course .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
__pt-br__ Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
__pt-br__ It offers many insights .
__pt-br__ For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
__pt-br__ It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
__pt-br__ A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
__pt-br__ Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
__pt-br__ There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
__pt-br__ Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
__pt-br__ So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
__pt-br__ So I started reading books in pairs .
__pt-br__ So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
__pt-br__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
__pt-br__ For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
__pt-br__ So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
__pt-br__ &#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
__pt-br__ I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
__pt-br__ Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high speeds .
__pt-br__ That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
__pt-br__ I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vuvuzela , weird jokes about octopi .
__pt-br__ But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stressing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s been a major trending topic .
__pt-br__ Being a monolingual American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
__pt-br__ So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
__pt-br__ They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
__pt-br__ In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
__pt-br__ Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
__pt-br__ Every year , more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades .
__pt-br__ Ethan Zuckerman : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
__pt-br__ It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
__pt-br__ Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s terribly endangered .
__pt-br__ The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Brazilian friends tell me — is pitching in to help out .
__pt-br__ It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
__pt-br__ Now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
__pt-br__ In Portugese , it means &quot; &quot; Shut your mouth , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refers to this guy , Galvao Bueno , who &apos;s the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo .
__pt-br__ And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
__pt-br__ He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again .
__pt-br__ So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea , put up this banner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
__pt-br__ Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
__pt-br__ And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
__pt-br__ So as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
__pt-br__ The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s more than five million of them .
__pt-br__ As far as national representation , 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
__pt-br__ Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
__pt-br__ Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
__pt-br__ Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
__pt-br__ And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
__pt-br__ And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space .
__pt-br__ Twitter recently did some research .
__pt-br__ They looked at their local population .
__pt-br__ They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population .
__pt-br__ And again , that was very shocking to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
__pt-br__ And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .
__pt-br__ And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations .
__pt-br__ This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
__pt-br__ It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that cookout is a mostly black conversation .
__pt-br__ And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
__pt-br__ You click on that cookout tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it .
__pt-br__ But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
__pt-br__ We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend Eli Pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
__pt-br__ And we tend not to see that wider picture .
__pt-br__ Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
__pt-br__ If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Being Digital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
__pt-br__ Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
__pt-br__ And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of Evian water on the table .
__pt-br__ And Negroponte says this is crazy .
__pt-br__ This is the old economy .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is speedy , it &apos;s weightless .
__pt-br__ It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
__pt-br__ Now , Negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
__pt-br__ It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
__pt-br__ If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in Fiji , shipped at great expense to the United States .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fiji .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s crackdowns on the press .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
__pt-br__ I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
__pt-br__ We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like airline routes .
__pt-br__ It includes things like the Internet cables .
__pt-br__ We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
__pt-br__ You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bangalore later today .
__pt-br__ Two hops , you &apos;re in Suva , the capitol of Fiji .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s all right there .
__pt-br__ When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
__pt-br__ You start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s extremely lumpy .
__pt-br__ There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York .
__pt-br__ but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
__pt-br__ You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
__pt-br__ And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
__pt-br__ When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
__pt-br__ The world is , in fact , getting more global .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s getting more connected .
__pt-br__ More of problems are global in scale .
__pt-br__ More of our economics is global in scale .
__pt-br__ And our media is less global by the day .
__pt-br__ If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
__pt-br__ And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk .
__pt-br__ Alisa &apos;s the president of Public Radio International .
__pt-br__ And she made a cartogram , which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month .
__pt-br__ And you see that when you distort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S.
__pt-br__ and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
__pt-br__ And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dreadful , and I agree that it &apos;s dreadful — I &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
__pt-br__ When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
__pt-br__ It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s a map made by Mark Graham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
__pt-br__ A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded .
__pt-br__ And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
__pt-br__ Even within Wikipedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
__pt-br__ In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
__pt-br__ You probably won &apos;t .
__pt-br__ If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
__pt-br__ So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism .
__pt-br__ We look at the internet .
__pt-br__ We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
__pt-br__ We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
__pt-br__ And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red Sox scores .
__pt-br__ So this is a real problem — not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
__pt-br__ This is a problem we have to solve .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s the good news .
__pt-br__ For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
__pt-br__ This is a group called Global Voices .
__pt-br__ This is a team of bloggers from around the world .
__pt-br__ Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
__pt-br__ We started in 2004 .
__pt-br__ You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
__pt-br__ Nor do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
__pt-br__ But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
__pt-br__ The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
__pt-br__ In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
__pt-br__ And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
__pt-br__ What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encouragement .
__pt-br__ One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
__pt-br__ And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
__pt-br__ They were doing something much simpler .
__pt-br__ It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
__pt-br__ but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
__pt-br__ Most independent media was shut down .
__pt-br__ And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
__pt-br__ So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
__pt-br__ Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak Malagasy .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
__pt-br__ Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;re using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page .
__pt-br__ Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine translation of the page .
__pt-br__ And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dreadful with Chinese .
__pt-br__ And the results can be pretty funny .
__pt-br__ What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this .
__pt-br__ And if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a group right now in China called Yeeyan .
__pt-br__ And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
__pt-br__ They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
__pt-br__ They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
__pt-br__ They put it online for free .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the project of a guy named Zhang Lei , who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
__pt-br__ And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Yeeyan ?
__pt-br__ Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
__pt-br__ My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
__pt-br__ So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guarantee that we &apos;re going to find it .
__pt-br__ When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
__pt-br__ We use a lot of search .
__pt-br__ And search is terrific if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
__pt-br__ But if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
__pt-br__ What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
__pt-br__ The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
__pt-br__ You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
__pt-br__ To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
__pt-br__ You need a guide .
__pt-br__ So this is Amira Al Hussaini . She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices .
__pt-br__ She has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
__pt-br__ Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
__pt-br__ And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of Ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
__pt-br__ She has to know something about what stories are available .
__pt-br__ Basically , she &apos;s a deejay .
__pt-br__ She &apos;s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
__pt-br__ I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience .
__pt-br__ I know Amira .
__pt-br__ I can ask her what to read .
__pt-br__ But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
__pt-br__ And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
__pt-br__ So once you start widening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start translating , once you start curating , you end up in some really weird places .
__pt-br__ This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is AfriGadget .
__pt-br__ And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
__pt-br__ And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel .
__pt-br__ And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conceivably care about this ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
__pt-br__ This is Erik Hersman . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
__pt-br__ He goes by the moniker White African .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s both a very well known American geek , but he &apos;s also Kenyan ; he was born in Sudan , grew up in Kenya .
__pt-br__ He is a bridge figure .
__pt-br__ He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
__pt-br__ And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
__pt-br__ He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
__pt-br__ These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
__pt-br__ But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s where we start talking about xenophiles .
__pt-br__ So if I found myself in the NFL , I suspect I would spend my off-season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hip-hop album .
__pt-br__ Dhani Jones , who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
__pt-br__ Dhani has a television show .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , Dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
__pt-br__ He finds a local sporting team .
__pt-br__ He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
__pt-br__ And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
__pt-br__ For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
__pt-br__ For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
__pt-br__ But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
__pt-br__ The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia .
__pt-br__ My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TEDGlobal — is that most of you are xenophiles , whether or not you use that term .
__pt-br__ My challenge instead is this .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
__pt-br__ We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have .
__pt-br__ We have to fix our media .
__pt-br__ We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
__pt-br__ We have to fix our immigration policy .
__pt-br__ We need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
__pt-br__ And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
__pt-br__ And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity .
__pt-br__ It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
__pt-br__ What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
__pt-br__ The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
__pt-br__ So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emptying out .
__pt-br__ The question is , why ?
__pt-br__ And here &apos;s the unromantic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
__pt-br__ And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
__pt-br__ They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
__pt-br__ One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
__pt-br__ They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
__pt-br__ Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
__pt-br__ Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
__pt-br__ One-sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
__pt-br__ And here &apos;s the second punch line .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
__pt-br__ Stars have shined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
__pt-br__ Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
__pt-br__ Guess who was the performing guest ?
__pt-br__ Susan Boyle .
__pt-br__ And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
__pt-br__ It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
__pt-br__ Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
__pt-br__ That was hilarious .
__pt-br__ So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
__pt-br__ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
__pt-br__ And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
__pt-br__ Well , being different is not that difficult .
__pt-br__ We are all different from different perspectives .
__pt-br__ But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
__pt-br__ You may have the chance to make a difference .
__pt-br__ My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
__pt-br__ I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton — it &apos;s still there .
__pt-br__ So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
__pt-br__ That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
__pt-br__ Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
__pt-br__ The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
__pt-br__ So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
__pt-br__ Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
__pt-br__ But actually , they were impressed by my words .
__pt-br__ And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
__pt-br__ After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
__pt-br__ So I was on a national television prime-time show .
__pt-br__ And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
__pt-br__ Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
__pt-br__ So we do a lot of things .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
__pt-br__ And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
__pt-br__ But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
__pt-br__ I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
__pt-br__ I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
__pt-br__ I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
__pt-br__ But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
__pt-br__ How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
__pt-br__ So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
__pt-br__ First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
__pt-br__ Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei — 20 years old , beautiful .
__pt-br__ She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
__pt-br__ And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
__pt-br__ She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
__pt-br__ The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
__pt-br__ So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
__pt-br__ All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
__pt-br__ But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
__pt-br__ It is still boiling .
__pt-br__ It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
__pt-br__ And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
__pt-br__ Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
__pt-br__ Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
__pt-br__ On Tencent , 200 million .
__pt-br__ The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
__pt-br__ About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
__pt-br__ And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
__pt-br__ But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
__pt-br__ So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
__pt-br__ So how are they different ?
__pt-br__ First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
__pt-br__ And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
__pt-br__ That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
__pt-br__ Most of them have fairly good education .
__pt-br__ The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
__pt-br__ In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
__pt-br__ But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
__pt-br__ And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
__pt-br__ So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
__pt-br__ So making a living is not that easy for young people .
__pt-br__ College graduates are not in short supply .
__pt-br__ In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
__pt-br__ So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
__pt-br__ That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
__pt-br__ Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
__pt-br__ They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
__pt-br__ Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
__pt-br__ They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
__pt-br__ And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
__pt-br__ Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
__pt-br__ But they died because of all different personal reasons .
__pt-br__ But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
__pt-br__ For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
__pt-br__ So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
__pt-br__ These diagrams show a more general social background .
__pt-br__ The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
__pt-br__ But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
__pt-br__ The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
__pt-br__ Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
__pt-br__ And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
__pt-br__ And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
__pt-br__ So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
__pt-br__ So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
__pt-br__ Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
__pt-br__ For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
__pt-br__ And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
__pt-br__ Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
__pt-br__ So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
__pt-br__ So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
__pt-br__ Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
__pt-br__ We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
__pt-br__ And guess what , we have faked beef .
__pt-br__ They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
__pt-br__ And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
__pt-br__ So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
__pt-br__ And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
__pt-br__ While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
__pt-br__ China is soon to pass the U.S.
__pt-br__ as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
__pt-br__ But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re not rich at all .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
__pt-br__ And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
__pt-br__ But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
__pt-br__ So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
__pt-br__ It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
__pt-br__ And also , people are doing good through social media .
__pt-br__ And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
__pt-br__ People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
__pt-br__ And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
__pt-br__ And here also people are helping to find missing children .
__pt-br__ A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
__pt-br__ After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
__pt-br__ So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
__pt-br__ Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
__pt-br__ People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
__pt-br__ How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
__pt-br__ And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
__pt-br__ I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
__pt-br__ And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ This back here was my brain cancer .
__pt-br__ Isn &apos;t it nice ?
__pt-br__ And everyone changes as well .
__pt-br__ You suddenly become a disease on legs .
__pt-br__ They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
__pt-br__ So I created a website , which is called La Cura , on which I put my medical data , online .
__pt-br__ And , it worked .
__pt-br__ The La Cura website went viral .
__pt-br__ For example , here we see Francesca Fini in her performance .
__pt-br__ So I was able to take my time and choose .
__pt-br__ What are the outcomes ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
__pt-br__ Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged .
__pt-br__ Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
__pt-br__ This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
__pt-br__ A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
__pt-br__ Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
__pt-br__ I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from Pablo Picasso , &quot; &quot; We all know that Art is not truth .
__pt-br__ Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand .
__pt-br__ The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a kid , and I loved it , but I had no idea what it meant .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fiction and reality .
__pt-br__ So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences ?
__pt-br__ And I said , I &apos;ve got PowerPoint . Let &apos;s do a Venn diagram .
__pt-br__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Truth . Lies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , boom .
__pt-br__ That liminal space , that &apos;s art .
__pt-br__ The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art , at least the art of fiction , was , was working with kids .
__pt-br__ I used to be a summer camp counselor .
__pt-br__ I would do it on my summers off from college , and I loved it .
__pt-br__ It was a sports summer camp for four- to six-year-olds .
__pt-br__ I was in charge of the four-year-olds , which is good , because four-year-olds can &apos;t play sports , and neither can I.
__pt-br__ I would tell them about how , on the weekends , I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England .
__pt-br__ And soon , other kids who weren &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Mac Barnett , right ?
__pt-br__ You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question .
__pt-br__ And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
__pt-br__ I think the pinnacle of this for me — I &apos;ll never forget this — there was this little girl named Riley . She was tiny , and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out her fruit .
__pt-br__ And so Riley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
__pt-br__ And — ( Laughter ) — she went trudging through the ivy , and then her eyes just got so wide , and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; Hey , why is there a sticker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the ivy .
__pt-br__ Put them in the trash can . It ruins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Riley carried that melon around with her all day , and she was so proud .
__pt-br__ And Riley knew she didn &apos;t grow a melon in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
__pt-br__ She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fiction .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief or poetic faith , for those moments where a story , no matter how strange , has some semblance of the truth , and then you &apos;re able to believe it .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
__pt-br__ Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s why in two days , people will be descending on Dublin to take the walking tour of Bloomsday and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; Ulysses , &quot; &quot; even though none of that happened .
__pt-br__ and yet we also know that they are .
__pt-br__ Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can , and that &apos;s why I love writing for kids .
__pt-br__ I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction .
__pt-br__ And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist and I would look for them and try to go through them .
__pt-br__ I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world , which is — I would always just open people &apos;s closet doors . ( Laughter ) I would just go through my mom &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s closet , and there was not a secret magical land there .
__pt-br__ This is a place called 826 Valencia .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s at 826 Valencia Street in the Mission in San Francisco , and when I worked there , there was a publishing company headquartered there called McSweeney &apos;s , a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia , but then the front of it was a strange shop .
__pt-br__ You see , this place was zoned retail , and in San Francisco , they were not going to give us a variance , and so the writer who founded it , a writer named Dave Eggers , to come into compliance with code , he said , &quot; &quot; Fine , I &apos;m just going to build a pirate supply store . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what he did . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wood .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s drawers you can pull out and get citrus so you don &apos;t get scurvy .
__pt-br__ They have eyepatches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s springtime , pirates want to go wild .
__pt-br__ You don &apos;t know . Black is boring . Pastel .
__pt-br__ So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
__pt-br__ So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s our motto : &quot; &quot; Whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles .
__pt-br__ Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re from all eras , including just the 1980s , that guy on the end , he &apos;s from the very recent past .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s our Employees of the Month , including Genghis Khan , Charles Dickens .
__pt-br__ Some great people have come up through our ranks .
__pt-br__ This is our kind of pharmacy section .
__pt-br__ We have some patent medicines , Canopic jars for your organs , communist soap that says , &quot; &quot; This is your soap for the year . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Our slushy machine broke on the opening night and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
__pt-br__ Our architect was covered in red syrup .
__pt-br__ Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
__pt-br__ Barbarian repellent . It &apos;s full of salad and potpourri — things that barbarians hate .
__pt-br__ Dead languages .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
__pt-br__ And Viking Odorant , which comes in lots of great scents : toenails , sweat and rotten vegetables , pyre ash .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
__pt-br__ The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
__pt-br__ You can &apos;t find the seams on the fiction , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fiction that &apos;s colonized the real world .
__pt-br__ I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a term called metafiction , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and meta &apos;s having a moment now .
__pt-br__ Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis , but it &apos;s been around .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s almost as old as storytelling itself .
__pt-br__ And one metafictive technique is breaking the fourth wall . Right ?
__pt-br__ For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
__pt-br__ If I &apos;m going to break down the fourth wall , I want fiction to escape and come into the real world .
__pt-br__ I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
__pt-br__ And so I try to do this in my books .
__pt-br__ And here &apos;s just one example .
__pt-br__ This is the first book that I ever made .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it &apos;s a punishment and it ruins his life .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s delivered overnight by FedUp .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
__pt-br__ He lives in San Francisco — very tough city to own a blue whale in .
__pt-br__ A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
__pt-br__ This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
__pt-br__ But underneath the jacket is this case , and that &apos;s the cover underneath the book , the jacket , and there &apos;s an ad that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial for a blue whale .
__pt-br__ And you can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and we &apos;ll send you a whale .
__pt-br__ And kids do write in .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s a letter . It says , &quot; &quot; Dear people , I bet you 10 bucks you won &apos;t send me a blue whale .
__pt-br__ But it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
__pt-br__ And when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the outgoing message , it &apos;s just whale sounds and then a beep , which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound .
__pt-br__ And they get a picture of their whale too .
__pt-br__ So this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Nico &apos;s message .
__pt-br__ This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
__pt-br__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
__pt-br__ I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
__pt-br__ So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . Bye .
__pt-br__ Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
__pt-br__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
__pt-br__ I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
__pt-br__ MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
__pt-br__ This is the Christmas message from Nico .
__pt-br__ &#91; Beep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so busy because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a whale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a merry Christmas .
__pt-br__ So have a nice Christmas , and bye-bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
__pt-br__ MB : I actually got Nico , I hadn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a message two days ago .
__pt-br__ His voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
__pt-br__ But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
__pt-br__ I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create .
__pt-br__ I feel lucky . Kids like Nico are the best readers , and they deserve the best stories we can give them .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Phew , phew , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Usually when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scream out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
__pt-br__ And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( Vvvwow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Whoa ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
__pt-br__ Well , what I &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
__pt-br__ See , the closer I get to this antenna , the higher the note gets — ( Portamento ) — and you can get it really low .
__pt-br__ And with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the louder it gets .
__pt-br__ ( Tones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
__pt-br__ ( Flourish ... Beep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I startle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( Blip ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re going to do a song by David Mash called &quot; &quot; Listen : the Words Are Gone , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ; there are so many .
__pt-br__ And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin .
__pt-br__ It was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , Léon Theremin — he also was a musician besides an inventor — he came up with the idea for making the theremin , I think , when he was working on some shortwave radios .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( Screeching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pitches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now .
__pt-br__ And a lot of times , even kids nowadays , they &apos;ll make reference to a theremin by going , &quot; &quot; Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , goofy sound to do .
__pt-br__ And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibrato gets out of hand .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
__pt-br__ You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
__pt-br__ It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
__pt-br__ And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( Tone rising out of key ) — and breathing will make it ...
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
__pt-br__ And if I go to a club and play a gig , people are like , &quot; Here , have some drinks on us ! &quot;
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Teetering tones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
__pt-br__ it &apos;s similar to being a vocalist , except instead of it coming out of your throat , you &apos;re controlling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ; you &apos;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .
__pt-br__ You just have to always adjust to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it , adjust it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
__pt-br__ I think we will play another tune now .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; Lush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tunes to play .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his &quot; &quot; I Have A Dream &quot; &quot; speech .
__pt-br__ But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a lasting one that remains .
__pt-br__ I was born in a family full of colors .
__pt-br__ My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone .
__pt-br__ He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents .
__pt-br__ The matriarch , my grandma , has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair .
__pt-br__ My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
__pt-br__ She has two sisters .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Growing up in this family , color was never important for me .
__pt-br__ Outside home , however , things were different soon .
__pt-br__ Color had many other meanings .
__pt-br__ I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
__pt-br__ It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil .
__pt-br__ I was made of flesh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
__pt-br__ My skin was brown , and people said I was black .
__pt-br__ I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
__pt-br__ Later , when I took my cousin to school , I was usually taken for the nanny .
__pt-br__ By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the maid .
__pt-br__ I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends .
__pt-br__ And many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elevator .
__pt-br__ In some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
__pt-br__ However , something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling .
__pt-br__ Years later I married a Spaniard .
__pt-br__ But not any Spaniard .
__pt-br__ I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
__pt-br__ What will be the color of your children ?
__pt-br__ As you can understand , this is my last concern .
__pt-br__ But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
__pt-br__ And that is how Humanae was born .
__pt-br__ Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the untrue white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
__pt-br__ I portray the subjects in a white background .
__pt-br__ Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette , Pantone .
__pt-br__ I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
__pt-br__ I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain .
__pt-br__ The snowball started to roll .
__pt-br__ The project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
__pt-br__ just happened .
__pt-br__ And among them , my favorite : when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
__pt-br__ I have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
__pt-br__ Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the Forbes list , to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat .
__pt-br__ In Paris , from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter .
__pt-br__ And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro .
__pt-br__ All kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or terminally ill .
__pt-br__ We all together build Humanae .
__pt-br__ Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
__pt-br__ When modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
__pt-br__ Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
__pt-br__ Or does it have to do with our origin , nationality or bank account ?
__pt-br__ This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
__pt-br__ Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people .
__pt-br__ It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label .
__pt-br__ It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
__pt-br__ I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
__pt-br__ So your work has a very special place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereotype , a box .
__pt-br__ Perhaps we should stop .
__pt-br__ Instead of framing , ask the individual , &apos; How would you label yourself ? &apos; Then I would say , &apos; Hi . I &apos;m Massiel .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m a Dominican-Dutch , I grew up in a mixed family and I &apos;m a bisexual woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; Besides these unexpected and touching reactions , Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields .
__pt-br__ Just to show you some examples , illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a collection of faces .
__pt-br__ Researchers in the fields of anthropology , physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity , optophysiology , face recognition or Alzheimer &apos;s .
__pt-br__ One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs , one of the most relevant political publications .
__pt-br__ And talking about foreign affairs , I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
__pt-br__ They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
__pt-br__ Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
__pt-br__ My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
__pt-br__ As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
__pt-br__ As an individual , as Angélica , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist .
__pt-br__ The last country — the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
__pt-br__ We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
__pt-br__ That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
__pt-br__ I feel so fortunate .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
__pt-br__ I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
__pt-br__ It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
__pt-br__ But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
__pt-br__ Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
__pt-br__ And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
__pt-br__ She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Tweets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
__pt-br__ She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
__pt-br__ But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
__pt-br__ Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
__pt-br__ And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
__pt-br__ And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
__pt-br__ And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
__pt-br__ It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
__pt-br__ It all started back in 1977 .
__pt-br__ I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
__pt-br__ And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
__pt-br__ And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses — and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
__pt-br__ So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
__pt-br__ It was an experimental education program .
__pt-br__ It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
__pt-br__ And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention — kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
__pt-br__ And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
__pt-br__ And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
__pt-br__ There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
__pt-br__ Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
__pt-br__ She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
__pt-br__ There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
__pt-br__ And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
__pt-br__ So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
__pt-br__ His name is Chris Farina .
__pt-br__ Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
__pt-br__ Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
__pt-br__ He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
__pt-br__ Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
__pt-br__ So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
__pt-br__ And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the eerie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
__pt-br__ What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
__pt-br__ I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
__pt-br__ I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
__pt-br__ And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
__pt-br__ And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
__pt-br__ And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
__pt-br__ And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
__pt-br__ You know the one .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
__pt-br__ And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
__pt-br__ And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
__pt-br__ My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
__pt-br__ And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
__pt-br__ And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
__pt-br__ I am one of her teaching gestures .
__pt-br__ And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
__pt-br__ And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
__pt-br__ And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not here alone .
__pt-br__ There are many people on this stage right now .
__pt-br__ And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
__pt-br__ It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
__pt-br__ I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
__pt-br__ We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
__pt-br__ I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
__pt-br__ So I thought , well they like to play games .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 — but something interactive .
__pt-br__ And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
__pt-br__ And it has four Plexiglass layers .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
__pt-br__ There are four countries around the board .
__pt-br__ The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
__pt-br__ They have different assets , commercial and military .
__pt-br__ And each country has a cabinet .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
__pt-br__ I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
__pt-br__ I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
__pt-br__ And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
__pt-br__ So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
__pt-br__ I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
__pt-br__ And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
__pt-br__ If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ So I also have in the game a saboteur — some child — it &apos;s basically a troublemaker — and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
__pt-br__ But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
__pt-br__ And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
__pt-br__ The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; Fourth-graders understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
__pt-br__ They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
__pt-br__ Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
__pt-br__ And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
__pt-br__ The students run the game .
__pt-br__ I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
__pt-br__ You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
__pt-br__ See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
__pt-br__ John Hunter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
__pt-br__ And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
__pt-br__ And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
__pt-br__ And so I apologize to them as well .
__pt-br__ I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
__pt-br__ Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
__pt-br__ Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
__pt-br__ ( Chatter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
__pt-br__ In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
__pt-br__ And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
__pt-br__ And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
__pt-br__ Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
__pt-br__ She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
__pt-br__ And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
__pt-br__ We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
__pt-br__ This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her girlfriends she said that .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a breach there .
__pt-br__ And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) They are the toughest opponents .
__pt-br__ And we were very upset .
__pt-br__ I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
__pt-br__ But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
__pt-br__ So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
__pt-br__ Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
__pt-br__ She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
__pt-br__ Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
__pt-br__ I could not have designed that in teaching it .
__pt-br__ It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
__pt-br__ We have a letter in the game .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
__pt-br__ You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
__pt-br__ So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
__pt-br__ And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County — and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
__pt-br__ It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
__pt-br__ She read two sentences .
__pt-br__ By the third sentence , she was in tears .
__pt-br__ I was in tears .
__pt-br__ Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
__pt-br__ We all lose .
__pt-br__ And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s been in many battles .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
__pt-br__ I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
__pt-br__ But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
__pt-br__ One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
__pt-br__ And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
__pt-br__ JH : I get chills every time I see that .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
__pt-br__ And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
__pt-br__ But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
__pt-br__ We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
__pt-br__ We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
__pt-br__ This is about my friend Brennan .
__pt-br__ We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
__pt-br__ The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
__pt-br__ Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
__pt-br__ The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
__pt-br__ He says , &quot; &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
__pt-br__ So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
__pt-br__ There was no way they could win .
__pt-br__ And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time — there was about a minute left — and despair just settled over the room .
__pt-br__ I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
__pt-br__ I should have gotten it so they could have won .
__pt-br__ They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve failed them .
__pt-br__ And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
__pt-br__ And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
__pt-br__ Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
__pt-br__ They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
__pt-br__ They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
__pt-br__ Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
__pt-br__ The parents were looking in the window .
__pt-br__ And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
__pt-br__ He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
__pt-br__ And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
__pt-br__ And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
__pt-br__ Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
__pt-br__ Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
__pt-br__ Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
__pt-br__ Every game we play is different .
__pt-br__ Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
__pt-br__ Some games are more about warfare .
__pt-br__ But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
__pt-br__ I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
__pt-br__ And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
__pt-br__ And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
__pt-br__ If only .
__pt-br__ And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
__pt-br__ He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
__pt-br__ His village is near Mogadishu .
__pt-br__ Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
__pt-br__ With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .
__pt-br__ When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
__pt-br__ He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
__pt-br__ Maybe a year passes , nothing .
__pt-br__ One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
__pt-br__ He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
__pt-br__ He is introduced to this young woman .
__pt-br__ He eventually gets married .
__pt-br__ He starts this new life .
__pt-br__ He has a purpose in life .
__pt-br__ One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
__pt-br__ That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
__pt-br__ He was waiting .
__pt-br__ He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
__pt-br__ This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
__pt-br__ And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
__pt-br__ It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
__pt-br__ For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
__pt-br__ Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
__pt-br__ By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
__pt-br__ If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
__pt-br__ And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
__pt-br__ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
__pt-br__ They pretty much do nothing .
__pt-br__ I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Madina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
__pt-br__ I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
__pt-br__ Would I have become a terrorist ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
__pt-br__ My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .
__pt-br__ I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
__pt-br__ We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
__pt-br__ One of the young men in the room was Aden .
__pt-br__ He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
__pt-br__ There were no jobs , no opportunities .
__pt-br__ I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
__pt-br__ They sought people like him out .
__pt-br__ But his story takes a different route .
__pt-br__ In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
__pt-br__ Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around .
__pt-br__ Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
__pt-br__ He started a motorbike company .
__pt-br__ He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
__pt-br__ He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
__pt-br__ How is this story different ?
__pt-br__ What makes his story different ?
__pt-br__ I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
__pt-br__ It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
__pt-br__ And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
__pt-br__ I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .
__pt-br__ He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad .
__pt-br__ If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
__pt-br__ for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
__pt-br__ He started a landscaping and design floral company .
__pt-br__ He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
__pt-br__ And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
__pt-br__ He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
__pt-br__ And he doesn &apos;t grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
__pt-br__ So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
__pt-br__ They had never really thought about starting up a business .
__pt-br__ They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
__pt-br__ He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
__pt-br__ He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
__pt-br__ By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
__pt-br__ They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
__pt-br__ So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
__pt-br__ They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
__pt-br__ Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
__pt-br__ For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
__pt-br__ Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
__pt-br__ I believe he is selling hope .
__pt-br__ His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
__pt-br__ Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him .
__pt-br__ He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
__pt-br__ These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
__pt-br__ So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
__pt-br__ I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
__pt-br__ So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burniss Travis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ So the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
__pt-br__ It is really a sacred space .
__pt-br__ And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
__pt-br__ You really are alive right here in this moment .
__pt-br__ There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand .
__pt-br__ We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
__pt-br__ In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Titi Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
__pt-br__ Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
__pt-br__ You have no time for projected ideas .
__pt-br__ So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
__pt-br__ So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the bandstand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
__pt-br__ The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
__pt-br__ Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
__pt-br__ So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
__pt-br__ ( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F. ( Music )
__pt-br__ See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
__pt-br__ If you played an E.
__pt-br__ See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
__pt-br__ If you played an F # though , ( Dissonance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
__pt-br__ And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
__pt-br__ And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
__pt-br__ And we won &apos;t react to it .
__pt-br__ He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
__pt-br__ The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
__pt-br__ It was an opportunity that was missed .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
__pt-br__ He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
__pt-br__ I ended up creating a melody out of it .
__pt-br__ The texture changed in the drums this time .
__pt-br__ It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
__pt-br__ So there is no mistake .
__pt-br__ The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
__pt-br__ So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
__pt-br__ And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
__pt-br__ We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
__pt-br__ So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
__pt-br__ Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
__pt-br__ And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micromanage in jazz .
__pt-br__ You have some people who do .
__pt-br__ But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
__pt-br__ If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
__pt-br__ ready , just play some time .
__pt-br__ One , two , one , two , three , four .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
__pt-br__ This is a science of listening .
__pt-br__ It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
__pt-br__ So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
__pt-br__ When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
__pt-br__ Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__pt-br__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
__pt-br__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__pt-br__ I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
__pt-br__ So most everyone watches TV .
__pt-br__ We like it . We like some parts of it .
__pt-br__ Here in America , people actually love TV .
__pt-br__ The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
__pt-br__ Okay ?
__pt-br__ Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
__pt-br__ But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
__pt-br__ They , in fact , berate it .
__pt-br__ They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
__pt-br__ My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
__pt-br__ So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .
__pt-br__ So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
__pt-br__ Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years .
__pt-br__ How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
__pt-br__ How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
__pt-br__ Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
__pt-br__ You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .
__pt-br__ As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
__pt-br__ We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
__pt-br__ We feel awe , we feel pity .
__pt-br__ That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
__pt-br__ The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .
__pt-br__ We love to watch TV .
__pt-br__ This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
__pt-br__ Animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
__pt-br__ So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
__pt-br__ Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
__pt-br__ I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
__pt-br__ Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
__pt-br__ So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
__pt-br__ We went back 50 years to the 1959 / 1960 television season .
__pt-br__ We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
__pt-br__ We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
__pt-br__ How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
__pt-br__ Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
__pt-br__ Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
__pt-br__ What did this mean for you ?
__pt-br__ So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
__pt-br__ But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
__pt-br__ And on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
__pt-br__ So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
__pt-br__ Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern .
__pt-br__ And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen .
__pt-br__ Okay , here we go .
__pt-br__ So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
__pt-br__ Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
__pt-br__ Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
__pt-br__ As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
__pt-br__ Moral ambiguity starts to climb .
__pt-br__ Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane .
__pt-br__ Why ?
__pt-br__ The Cuban Missile Crisis , JFK is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , MLK is shot , Bobby Kennedy is shot , Watergate .
__pt-br__ Look what happens .
__pt-br__ In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
__pt-br__ Moral ambiguity takes off .
__pt-br__ They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a telegenic president , is in office .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s trying to recover .
__pt-br__ But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran-Contra , the Challenger disaster , Chernobyl .
__pt-br__ Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
__pt-br__ Take a look at this .
__pt-br__ This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
__pt-br__ But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .
__pt-br__ Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; Andy Griffith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
__pt-br__ This is rising . Comfort stays whole .
__pt-br__ Irreverence starts to rise .
__pt-br__ Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
__pt-br__ You get to 1969 , and look what happens .
__pt-br__ You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; Gunsmoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gomer Pyle &quot; &quot; — in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s number one ?
__pt-br__ The socially irreverent hippie show , &quot; Rowan and Martin &apos;s Laugh-In . &quot;
__pt-br__ They &apos;re all living together , right .
__pt-br__ Viewers had responded dramatically .
__pt-br__ Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show .
__pt-br__ When you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ?
__pt-br__ It means in the 1966 television season , The &quot; &quot; Smothers Brothers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
__pt-br__ This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presidency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
__pt-br__ So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
__pt-br__ In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
__pt-br__ Comfort is no longer why we watch television .
__pt-br__ Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .
__pt-br__ Now look at this .
__pt-br__ The 70s means who ? Norman Lear .
__pt-br__ You have &quot; &quot; All in the Family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top-10 for the entire 70s — &quot; MAS * H. &quot;
__pt-br__ In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration .
__pt-br__ Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
__pt-br__ It can make me feel this ?
__pt-br__ It can change us ?
__pt-br__ So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
__pt-br__ Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
__pt-br__ This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
__pt-br__ Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
__pt-br__ No . In the 70s you have the bellwether show &quot; &quot; The Bionic Woman &quot; &quot; that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Million-Dollar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s Angels . &quot; &quot; Another spike in the 1980s — another spike in shows about control and power .
__pt-br__ What were those shows ?
__pt-br__ Glamorous and rich .
__pt-br__ &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
__pt-br__ Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
__pt-br__ So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
__pt-br__ Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
__pt-br__ Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
__pt-br__ The 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cheers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfeld . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
__pt-br__ But look : X marks the spot .
__pt-br__ In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succumbs to judgment once and for all .
__pt-br__ Why not ?
__pt-br__ We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
__pt-br__ We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
__pt-br__ We had 9 / 11 .
__pt-br__ Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
__pt-br__ Look what happens when we keep going .
__pt-br__ At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
__pt-br__ What do people want in their TV then ?
__pt-br__ I would have thought revenge or nostalgia .
__pt-br__ Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
__pt-br__ No , they want judgment .
__pt-br__ I can vote you off the island .
__pt-br__ I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
__pt-br__ I can choose the next American Idol . You &apos;re fired .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s all great , right ?
__pt-br__ So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
__pt-br__ There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom .
__pt-br__ The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Beaver . &quot; &quot; Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
__pt-br__ Maude Findlay , the epitome of the irreverent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even menopause on TV .
__pt-br__ The 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington .
__pt-br__ Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .
__pt-br__ This era &apos;s mom , Bree Van de Kamp .
__pt-br__ Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
__pt-br__ So to you all , the women of TEDWomen , the men of TEDWomen , the global audiences of TEDWomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
__pt-br__ But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
__pt-br__ They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as viewers , through your collective social consciences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
__pt-br__ So thanks very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll quote three people : Vannevar Bush , Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee .
__pt-br__ So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
__pt-br__ This is Vannevar Bush .
__pt-br__ Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
__pt-br__ And in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly .
__pt-br__ And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth .
__pt-br__ The brain works by association .
__pt-br__ With one item in its thought , it snaps instantly to the next item .
__pt-br__ And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process .
__pt-br__ And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
__pt-br__ And the memex would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
__pt-br__ Now this was in 1945 .
__pt-br__ A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
__pt-br__ And nobody knew anything about it .
__pt-br__ So this was before the computer was invented .
__pt-br__ And he proposed this machine called the memex .
__pt-br__ And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
__pt-br__ So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S. Air Force officer .
__pt-br__ And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
__pt-br__ And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
__pt-br__ And by the mid-60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
__pt-br__ He built a system .
__pt-br__ The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
__pt-br__ And in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called NLS for oN-Line System .
__pt-br__ And this is Doug Engelbart .
__pt-br__ He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968 .
__pt-br__ What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstrated this system .
__pt-br__ He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
__pt-br__ And he works this system .
__pt-br__ And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
__pt-br__ And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
__pt-br__ So this is where the mouse came from as well .
__pt-br__ So this is Doug Engelbart .
__pt-br__ The trouble with Doug Engelbart &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
__pt-br__ So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
__pt-br__ But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
__pt-br__ And my company , OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh .
__pt-br__ And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
__pt-br__ And this began to get a head of steam .
__pt-br__ Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
__pt-br__ They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .
__pt-br__ The magazines started to cover it .
__pt-br__ Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext .
__pt-br__ We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version .
__pt-br__ And our PC version became quite mature .
__pt-br__ These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
__pt-br__ You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
__pt-br__ We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html .
__pt-br__ We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
__pt-br__ And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks .
__pt-br__ So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990 .
__pt-br__ And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you Ian Ritchie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
__pt-br__ And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
__pt-br__ But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day .
__pt-br__ And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
__pt-br__ I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he &apos;s not going to do this .
__pt-br__ So we didn &apos;t do it .
__pt-br__ In the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
__pt-br__ In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .
__pt-br__ In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web .
__pt-br__ And I saw it , and I thought , yep , that &apos;s it .
__pt-br__ And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in Edinburgh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker .
__pt-br__ So that puts me in pretty illustrious company .
__pt-br__ There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles .
__pt-br__ There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
__pt-br__ And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling &apos;s Harry Potter , I guess .
__pt-br__ On the other hand , there &apos;s Marc Andreessen who wrote the world &apos;s first browser for the World Wide Web .
__pt-br__ And according to Fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
__pt-br__ But is he happy ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
__pt-br__ And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
__pt-br__ He was not a political prisoner .
__pt-br__ He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
__pt-br__ What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
__pt-br__ And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
__pt-br__ We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
__pt-br__ It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel — it is what happens most of the time .
__pt-br__ I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
__pt-br__ First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
__pt-br__ The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
__pt-br__ And the third is commitment .
__pt-br__ So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
__pt-br__ Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
__pt-br__ And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
__pt-br__ My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
__pt-br__ And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
__pt-br__ The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; inaudible name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; Khrew , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have defended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
__pt-br__ And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
__pt-br__ And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
__pt-br__ She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
__pt-br__ She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d miscarried .
__pt-br__ And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
__pt-br__ But Cambodia is not alone .
__pt-br__ I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
__pt-br__ Or is it other countries ?
__pt-br__ But it is in so many countries .
__pt-br__ In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
__pt-br__ Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
__pt-br__ And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
__pt-br__ And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
__pt-br__ A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
__pt-br__ But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
__pt-br__ For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; inaudible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mumbling
__pt-br__ and grumbling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
__pt-br__ The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
__pt-br__ I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
__pt-br__ What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
__pt-br__ And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
__pt-br__ I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . Lawyers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
__pt-br__ Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
__pt-br__ But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
__pt-br__ So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
__pt-br__ And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
__pt-br__ And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
__pt-br__ The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
__pt-br__ We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
__pt-br__ And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
__pt-br__ So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
__pt-br__ And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
__pt-br__ This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
__pt-br__ So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
__pt-br__ We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
__pt-br__ But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
__pt-br__ And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
__pt-br__ Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
__pt-br__ It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
__pt-br__ Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
__pt-br__ I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice .
__pt-br__ Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
__pt-br__ So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
__pt-br__ So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
__pt-br__ You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
__pt-br__ Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
__pt-br__ And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vishna . He &apos;s a 4-year-old boy .
__pt-br__ He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
__pt-br__ And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ You &apos;d follow that guy back to his cubicle and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my chair ? &quot; &quot; Okay , so now it &apos;s Tuesday morning and you &apos;re at the office , and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s no agenda .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
__pt-br__ In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS : Mindless Accept Syndrome .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ And a well-run meeting can yield really positive , actionable results .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
__pt-br__ There are the participants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
__pt-br__ And everybody leaves very angry .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s kind of funny .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__pt-br__ As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — ( Laughter ) Hi , who just joined ?
__pt-br__ Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
__pt-br__ And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of views every month .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
__pt-br__ &quot; This is my life . &quot;
__pt-br__ One guy wrote , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s funny because it &apos;s true .
__pt-br__ Eerily , sadly , depressingly true .
__pt-br__ It made me laugh until I cried .
__pt-br__ But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
__pt-br__ In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Which , if I remember my high school Spanish , means something like , &quot; &quot; Enough already , make it stop ! &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how No MAS works . It &apos;s very simple .
__pt-br__ First of all , the next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , click the tentative button !
__pt-br__ It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
__pt-br__ Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
__pt-br__ Then , get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting .
__pt-br__ And if we do this often enough , and we do it respectfully , people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations .
__pt-br__ Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with .
__pt-br__ People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) .
__pt-br__ And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
__pt-br__ No .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
__pt-br__ But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a ringside seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers , like these .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Presenter : Haley Van Dyck !
__pt-br__ They &apos;re literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns .
__pt-br__ And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s something even more startling happening .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s take a look inside Haley &apos;s brain for a moment .
__pt-br__ There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle .
__pt-br__ But look here , right here — a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea .
__pt-br__ And incredibly , this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
__pt-br__ But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
__pt-br__ Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
__pt-br__ Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
__pt-br__ Sir Ken Robinson — creativity is key to our kids &apos; future .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
__pt-br__ Chris Anderson : Elora Hardy — building from bamboo is beautiful .
__pt-br__ CA : Chimamanda Adichie — people are more than a single identity .
__pt-br__ ( Video ) Chimamanda Adichie : The single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re carefully linked together .
__pt-br__ Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
__pt-br__ And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
__pt-br__ So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial .
__pt-br__ For example , how does your worldview react when you see this image : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you look at me ?
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an expert , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
__pt-br__ Ideas are complex things ; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you &apos;re most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
__pt-br__ You have to give context , share examples , make it vivid .
__pt-br__ Two , give your listeners a reason to care .
__pt-br__ And the main tool to achieve that ?
__pt-br__ Stir your audience &apos;s curiosity .
__pt-br__ Use intriguing , provocative questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs explaining .
__pt-br__ If you can reveal a disconnection in someone &apos;s worldview , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
__pt-br__ And once you &apos;ve sparked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
__pt-br__ Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
__pt-br__ Now , metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listener already understands .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
__pt-br__ And I need you to be honest with the answer .
__pt-br__ If the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
__pt-br__ The audience will see right through you .
__pt-br__ Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
__pt-br__ So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
__pt-br__ I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
__pt-br__ I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
__pt-br__ So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
__pt-br__ I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
__pt-br__ And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
__pt-br__ To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
__pt-br__ One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
__pt-br__ For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
__pt-br__ This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
__pt-br__ This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
__pt-br__ This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
__pt-br__ all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
__pt-br__ So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
__pt-br__ One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
__pt-br__ You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
__pt-br__ Students lack perseverance .
__pt-br__ They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
__pt-br__ And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
__pt-br__ This is really destructive .
__pt-br__ David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
__pt-br__ He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
__pt-br__ He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
__pt-br__ You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
__pt-br__ I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
__pt-br__ It applies equally to math .
__pt-br__ Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
__pt-br__ I believe in real life .
__pt-br__ And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
__pt-br__ And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
__pt-br__ When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
__pt-br__ And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
__pt-br__ You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
__pt-br__ So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
__pt-br__ But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
__pt-br__ You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
__pt-br__ You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
__pt-br__ So I hope you can see .
__pt-br__ I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
__pt-br__ So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
__pt-br__ So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
__pt-br__ And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
__pt-br__ So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
__pt-br__ And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
__pt-br__ And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
__pt-br__ And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
__pt-br__ And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
__pt-br__ The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
__pt-br__ And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
__pt-br__ But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
__pt-br__ Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
__pt-br__ He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
__pt-br__ So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
__pt-br__ And here &apos;s how it works .
__pt-br__ I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
__pt-br__ The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
__pt-br__ First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
__pt-br__ Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
__pt-br__ And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
__pt-br__ None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
__pt-br__ Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
__pt-br__ Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
__pt-br__ So now we have a water tank .
__pt-br__ How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
__pt-br__ And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
__pt-br__ So now we have the real deal .
__pt-br__ How long will it take it to fill it up ?
__pt-br__ And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s tedious .
__pt-br__ Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
__pt-br__ And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
__pt-br__ And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
__pt-br__ But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
__pt-br__ Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
__pt-br__ We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
__pt-br__ And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
__pt-br__ And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
__pt-br__ We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
__pt-br__ But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
__pt-br__ These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
__pt-br__ This has been a lot of fun .
__pt-br__ I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
__pt-br__ And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
__pt-br__ I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
__pt-br__ I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
__pt-br__ Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
__pt-br__ I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
__pt-br__ And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
__pt-br__ And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
__pt-br__ Math makes sense of the world .
__pt-br__ Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
__pt-br__ So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
__pt-br__ We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
__pt-br__ And I believed it to be true .
__pt-br__ Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
__pt-br__ So how is it that I understand sound ?
__pt-br__ Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
__pt-br__ You people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound .
__pt-br__ I learn and mirror that behavior .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m hyper-vigilant around sound .
__pt-br__ TBD , to be decided .
__pt-br__ TBC , to be continued .
__pt-br__ TBA , to be announced .
__pt-br__ In Deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
__pt-br__ This is a sign for &quot; &quot; staff &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__pt-br__ Prior to this time , I had been working as a painter .
__pt-br__ At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ...
__pt-br__ Now sound has come into my art territory .
__pt-br__ Is it going to further distance me from art ?
__pt-br__ I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
__pt-br__ I started creating a new body of work .
__pt-br__ And when I presented this to the art community , I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received .
__pt-br__ I chose to be empowered .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .
__pt-br__ And that way , I &apos;m able to maintain relevancy in society today .
__pt-br__ And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
__pt-br__ They help me to be heard .
__pt-br__ And their voices hold value and currency .
__pt-br__ So with sound as my new art medium , I delved into the world of music .
__pt-br__ And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL .
__pt-br__ So , envision a piano .
__pt-br__ ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
__pt-br__ The same applies to music in regards to pitch , tone and volume .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m looking at you .
__pt-br__ Staring at you .
__pt-br__ Uh-oh .
__pt-br__ What are you looking at ?
__pt-br__ Aw , stop .
__pt-br__ All ... day .
__pt-br__ This is ALL-NIGHT , represented in this drawing .
__pt-br__ We have the staff across the head and the chest .
__pt-br__ Everybody , hands up .
__pt-br__ Yes , got it .
__pt-br__ And now this .
__pt-br__ This is &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__pt-br__ And again .
__pt-br__ This is &quot; &quot; enlightenment &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__pt-br__ &quot; Fall in love , &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; and &quot; &quot; enlightenment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
__pt-br__ And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
__pt-br__ Denise Kahler-Braaten : Hey , that &apos;s me .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
__pt-br__ So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
__pt-br__ Sort of an interesting thing .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
__pt-br__ And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
__pt-br__ You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
__pt-br__ In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
__pt-br__ And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
__pt-br__ I actually went to see this one .
__pt-br__ There was a lot of people there .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
__pt-br__ I was born and raised in North Korea .
__pt-br__ I was four years old .
__pt-br__ My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
__pt-br__ Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
__pt-br__ For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
__pt-br__ On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
__pt-br__ I saw my father wither away and die .
__pt-br__ In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
__pt-br__ Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
__pt-br__ It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
__pt-br__ I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
__pt-br__ My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
__pt-br__ My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
__pt-br__ But that is no way to survive .
__pt-br__ I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
__pt-br__ So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
__pt-br__ I was not uncommon .
__pt-br__ Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
__pt-br__ That hope kept me alive .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
__pt-br__ But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
__pt-br__ I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
__pt-br__ Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
__pt-br__ I was 16 years old .
__pt-br__ I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
__pt-br__ By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
__pt-br__ Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
__pt-br__ I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
__pt-br__ And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
__pt-br__ Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
__pt-br__ At one point , my father gave up on me .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
__pt-br__ But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
__pt-br__ I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
__pt-br__ I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
__pt-br__ But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
__pt-br__ And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
__pt-br__ When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
__pt-br__ I looked at him sitting next to me .
__pt-br__ He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
__pt-br__ Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
__pt-br__ I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
__pt-br__ And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
__pt-br__ I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
__pt-br__ You have to choose to believe in hope .
__pt-br__ You have to make it yourself .
__pt-br__ In North Korea , I made it myself .
__pt-br__ Hope brought me to America .
__pt-br__ But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
__pt-br__ My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
__pt-br__ I did not come here by myself .
__pt-br__ I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
__pt-br__ Many people helped me along the way to get here .
__pt-br__ They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
__pt-br__ This is my message to you .
__pt-br__ Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
__pt-br__ AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
__pt-br__ Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
__pt-br__ And I — oh , gosh .
__pt-br__ I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
__pt-br__ I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
__pt-br__ And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
__pt-br__ AH : Sure , please .
__pt-br__ JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
__pt-br__ I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
__pt-br__ How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
__pt-br__ Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
__pt-br__ That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
__pt-br__ And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
__pt-br__ The reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
__pt-br__ So for example , in the case of Ticketmaster , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
__pt-br__ CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
__pt-br__ And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
__pt-br__ So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
__pt-br__ The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
__pt-br__ But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
__pt-br__ Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
__pt-br__ This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
__pt-br__ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
__pt-br__ This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
__pt-br__ And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
__pt-br__ So let me tell you what this project started .
__pt-br__ So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
__pt-br__ When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
__pt-br__ I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
__pt-br__ But then I started feeling bad .
__pt-br__ See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
__pt-br__ And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs .
__pt-br__ So then I started feeling bad .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
__pt-br__ But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
__pt-br__ So see , here &apos;s the thing .
__pt-br__ While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
__pt-br__ Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
__pt-br__ So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
__pt-br__ Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
__pt-br__ And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
__pt-br__ So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
__pt-br__ So let me explain how this works .
__pt-br__ So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
__pt-br__ Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
__pt-br__ Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
__pt-br__ Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
__pt-br__ Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
__pt-br__ It gives you an image for every page of the book .
__pt-br__ This is an image with text for every page of the book .
__pt-br__ The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s using a technology called OCR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
__pt-br__ Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
__pt-br__ Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
__pt-br__ For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
__pt-br__ So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
__pt-br__ So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
__pt-br__ And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
__pt-br__ But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
__pt-br__ So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
__pt-br__ And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
__pt-br__ And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
__pt-br__ So this is how the system works .
__pt-br__ And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
__pt-br__ So for example , Ticketmaster .
__pt-br__ So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
__pt-br__ Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
__pt-br__ Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
__pt-br__ And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
__pt-br__ And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
__pt-br__ And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
__pt-br__ So funny things can happen .
__pt-br__ For example , we presented this word .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christians &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
__pt-br__ But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
__pt-br__ So we get this . ( Text : bad christians ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Oops . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s another really bad one .
__pt-br__ JohnEdwards.com ( Text : Damn liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
__pt-br__ Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
__pt-br__ See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
__pt-br__ So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s how it works .
__pt-br__ Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
__pt-br__ Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
__pt-br__ But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
__pt-br__ There are tens of thousands of these .
__pt-br__ Some of them are very cute . ( Text : clenched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funnier .
__pt-br__ ( Text : stoned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
__pt-br__ So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
__pt-br__ This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA : 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
__pt-br__ And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
__pt-br__ So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
__pt-br__ And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
__pt-br__ But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
__pt-br__ So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
__pt-br__ So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
__pt-br__ Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
__pt-br__ This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
__pt-br__ It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
__pt-br__ Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
__pt-br__ So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
__pt-br__ It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Severin Hacker .
__pt-br__ Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
__pt-br__ So I posed the question to my graduate student .
__pt-br__ By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
__pt-br__ So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
__pt-br__ Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
__pt-br__ First of all , translating the Web .
__pt-br__ So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
__pt-br__ A large fraction of it is in English .
__pt-br__ If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
__pt-br__ So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
__pt-br__ So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
__pt-br__ Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
__pt-br__ Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
__pt-br__ Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
__pt-br__ Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
__pt-br__ Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
__pt-br__ It makes a lot of mistakes .
__pt-br__ Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
__pt-br__ So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
__pt-br__ Actually it was a forum post .
__pt-br__ It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
__pt-br__ It was translated from Japanese into English .
__pt-br__ So I &apos;ll just let you read .
__pt-br__ This person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
__pt-br__ So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
__pt-br__ So he &apos;s just explaining something .
__pt-br__ Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
__pt-br__ ( Text : At often , the goat-time install a error is vomit . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
__pt-br__ ( Text : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the dragon ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
__pt-br__ ( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
__pt-br__ ( Text : Please apologize for your stupidity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
__pt-br__ So back to the question .
__pt-br__ So we need people to translate the whole Web .
__pt-br__ So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
__pt-br__ We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
__pt-br__ We could do that .
__pt-br__ Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
__pt-br__ For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
__pt-br__ Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
__pt-br__ If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
__pt-br__ So it would be very expensive .
__pt-br__ So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
__pt-br__ Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
__pt-br__ The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
__pt-br__ So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s a big problem .
__pt-br__ The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
__pt-br__ How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
__pt-br__ Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
__pt-br__ So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
__pt-br__ Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
__pt-br__ But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
__pt-br__ And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals , and that is language education .
__pt-br__ So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
__pt-br__ People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
__pt-br__ For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
__pt-br__ So people really , really want to learn a new language .
__pt-br__ So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Duolingo — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
__pt-br__ And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
__pt-br__ So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
__pt-br__ We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
__pt-br__ And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
__pt-br__ And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
__pt-br__ But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
__pt-br__ Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
__pt-br__ First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
__pt-br__ People really can learn a language with it .
__pt-br__ And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
__pt-br__ So people really do learn a language .
__pt-br__ And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
__pt-br__ Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
__pt-br__ As opposed to learning with made-up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
__pt-br__ So people really do learn a language .
__pt-br__ But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
__pt-br__ So let me show you one example .
__pt-br__ This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
__pt-br__ The top is the German .
__pt-br__ The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
__pt-br__ And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
__pt-br__ You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
__pt-br__ Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
__pt-br__ We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
__pt-br__ Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
__pt-br__ So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
__pt-br__ Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
__pt-br__ So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
__pt-br__ And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
__pt-br__ Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
__pt-br__ Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
__pt-br__ The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
__pt-br__ This is totally biased towards the rich .
__pt-br__ Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
__pt-br__ So this is how we could monetize this .
__pt-br__ Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
__pt-br__ But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
__pt-br__ So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
__pt-br__ So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
__pt-br__ We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
__pt-br__ We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
__pt-br__ By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
__pt-br__ So thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania .
__pt-br__ I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
__pt-br__ It was a simple machine that changed my life .
__pt-br__ Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
__pt-br__ I had never used a computer .
__pt-br__ I had never seen an Internet .
__pt-br__ On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
__pt-br__ My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )
__pt-br__ There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
__pt-br__ But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
__pt-br__ I would like to share that story today .
__pt-br__ We have seven children in my family .
__pt-br__ All sisters , excepting me .
__pt-br__ This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
__pt-br__ Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
__pt-br__ Like everyone else , we grew maize .
__pt-br__ One year our fortune turned very bad .
__pt-br__ In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
__pt-br__ Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
__pt-br__ My family ate one meal per day , at night .
__pt-br__ Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
__pt-br__ The food passes through our bodies .
__pt-br__ We drop down to nothing .
__pt-br__ In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
__pt-br__ Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
__pt-br__ I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
__pt-br__ It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
__pt-br__ I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
__pt-br__ So I went to a library .
__pt-br__ I read books , science books , especially physics .
__pt-br__ I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
__pt-br__ I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
__pt-br__ Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
__pt-br__ It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
__pt-br__ Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
__pt-br__ So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
__pt-br__ But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
__pt-br__ Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
__pt-br__ Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
__pt-br__ It was one light at first .
__pt-br__ And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
__pt-br__ Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
__pt-br__ Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
__pt-br__ I had never seen an airplane before .
__pt-br__ I had never slept in a hotel .
__pt-br__ So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
__pt-br__ So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
__pt-br__ God bless .
__pt-br__ Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
__pt-br__ I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
__pt-br__ Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
__pt-br__ You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
__pt-br__ And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
__pt-br__ If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
__pt-br__ And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
__pt-br__ We would never do that in our own countries .
__pt-br__ But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
__pt-br__ This is happening to us today .
__pt-br__ And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
__pt-br__ And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
__pt-br__ And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
__pt-br__ If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
__pt-br__ We have three main groups .
__pt-br__ We have online criminals .
__pt-br__ Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
__pt-br__ And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
__pt-br__ These guys make money .
__pt-br__ They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
__pt-br__ We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
__pt-br__ Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
__pt-br__ This is Alfred Gonzalez .
__pt-br__ This is Stephen Watt .
__pt-br__ This is Bjorn Sundin .
__pt-br__ This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
__pt-br__ These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
__pt-br__ The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
__pt-br__ Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
__pt-br__ And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
__pt-br__ In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
__pt-br__ The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
__pt-br__ Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
__pt-br__ So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
__pt-br__ And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
__pt-br__ This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
__pt-br__ DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
__pt-br__ It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
__pt-br__ Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
__pt-br__ And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
__pt-br__ And his answer was yes .
__pt-br__ So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
__pt-br__ Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
__pt-br__ They sell certificates .
__pt-br__ What do you do with certificates ?
__pt-br__ Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
__pt-br__ Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
__pt-br__ Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
__pt-br__ and issue rogue certificates .
__pt-br__ And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
__pt-br__ What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
__pt-br__ Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
__pt-br__ Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
__pt-br__ They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
__pt-br__ The company headquarters are right here .
__pt-br__ So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
__pt-br__ But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
__pt-br__ For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
__pt-br__ If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
__pt-br__ But today , it goes beyond that .
__pt-br__ They will tap your Internet connection .
__pt-br__ They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
__pt-br__ Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
__pt-br__ Why should I worry ?
__pt-br__ Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
__pt-br__ Privacy is implied .
__pt-br__ Privacy is not up for discussion .
__pt-br__ This is not a question between privacy against security .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
__pt-br__ And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
__pt-br__ And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
__pt-br__ And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
__pt-br__ We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
__pt-br__ This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
__pt-br__ Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__pt-br__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__pt-br__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__pt-br__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__pt-br__ But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
__pt-br__ Values are a certain kind of fact .
__pt-br__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__pt-br__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__pt-br__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__pt-br__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__pt-br__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__pt-br__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__pt-br__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__pt-br__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__pt-br__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__pt-br__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
__pt-br__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__pt-br__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__pt-br__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__pt-br__ Probably not .
__pt-br__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__pt-br__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__pt-br__ And morality relates to these truths .
__pt-br__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__pt-br__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__pt-br__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__pt-br__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__pt-br__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__pt-br__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__pt-br__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__pt-br__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__pt-br__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__pt-br__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__pt-br__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__pt-br__ And these await our discovery .
__pt-br__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__pt-br__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__pt-br__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__pt-br__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__pt-br__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
__pt-br__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__pt-br__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__pt-br__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__pt-br__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__pt-br__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__pt-br__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
__pt-br__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__pt-br__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__pt-br__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__pt-br__ As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
__pt-br__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__pt-br__ There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__pt-br__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
__pt-br__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__pt-br__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__pt-br__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__pt-br__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__pt-br__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__pt-br__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__pt-br__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
__pt-br__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__pt-br__ Why would we think this ?
__pt-br__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__pt-br__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__pt-br__ But it clearly admits some exceptions .
__pt-br__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__pt-br__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__pt-br__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__pt-br__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__pt-br__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__pt-br__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__pt-br__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__pt-br__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__pt-br__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
__pt-br__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__pt-br__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__pt-br__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__pt-br__ Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__pt-br__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__pt-br__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__pt-br__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__pt-br__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__pt-br__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__pt-br__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__pt-br__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
__pt-br__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__pt-br__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__pt-br__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__pt-br__ But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__pt-br__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__pt-br__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__pt-br__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__pt-br__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__pt-br__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
__pt-br__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
__pt-br__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__pt-br__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__pt-br__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__pt-br__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
__pt-br__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__pt-br__ But this is just the point .
__pt-br__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__pt-br__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__pt-br__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__pt-br__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__pt-br__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__pt-br__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__pt-br__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__pt-br__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__pt-br__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__pt-br__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__pt-br__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__pt-br__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__pt-br__ It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__pt-br__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__pt-br__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
__pt-br__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__pt-br__ Language seems to be really important here .
__pt-br__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__pt-br__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__pt-br__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__pt-br__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
__pt-br__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__pt-br__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__pt-br__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
__pt-br__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__pt-br__ But can you reconcile that ?
__pt-br__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__pt-br__ Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__pt-br__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__pt-br__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__pt-br__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__pt-br__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__pt-br__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__pt-br__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__pt-br__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__pt-br__ SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
__pt-br__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__pt-br__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__pt-br__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__pt-br__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__pt-br__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
__pt-br__ A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
__pt-br__ This one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her Broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
__pt-br__ And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
__pt-br__ And after a few moments , her therapist tries a new tack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she sings , in one descending scale , she sings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
__pt-br__ And it &apos;s a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
__pt-br__ Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug , one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
__pt-br__ Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .
__pt-br__ And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
__pt-br__ When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
__pt-br__ and how late-stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
__pt-br__ But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
__pt-br__ I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
__pt-br__ I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes , these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with disfiguring cancers .
__pt-br__ I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor , that doctor without borders .
__pt-br__ On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
__pt-br__ Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
__pt-br__ It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
__pt-br__ And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic .
__pt-br__ It was my first audition , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
__pt-br__ And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra , to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
__pt-br__ But a year later , I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician .
__pt-br__ Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard , but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s , was treated with thorazine at Bellevue , and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later .
__pt-br__ Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The Soloist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
__pt-br__ And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
__pt-br__ Playing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
__pt-br__ I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
__pt-br__ And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill .
__pt-br__ But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
__pt-br__ And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel , I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony , bringing the light of music into the very darkest places , performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row , performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane .
__pt-br__ After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
__pt-br__ Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the footlights , out of the tuxedo tails , the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
__pt-br__ Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
__pt-br__ Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
__pt-br__ The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brahms , or chamber music by Beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
__pt-br__ And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
__pt-br__ And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
__pt-br__ I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Keats , the Romantic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
__pt-br__ Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
__pt-br__ And Keats said , &quot; &quot; Beauty is truth , and truth beauty .
__pt-br__ That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
__pt-br__ I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
__pt-br__ I have not slept in weeks .
__pt-br__ Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
__pt-br__ Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
__pt-br__ So I would walk around in a daze during the day .
__pt-br__ I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
__pt-br__ In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
__pt-br__ Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
__pt-br__ My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
__pt-br__ And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
__pt-br__ But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
__pt-br__ And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
__pt-br__ Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
__pt-br__ And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
__pt-br__ This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
__pt-br__ How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
__pt-br__ And so we started talking about this .
__pt-br__ And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
__pt-br__ All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
__pt-br__ But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
__pt-br__ And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
__pt-br__ So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
__pt-br__ And the idea was to put McSweeney &apos;s — McSweeney &apos;s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
__pt-br__ It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
__pt-br__ We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
__pt-br__ So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
__pt-br__ You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
__pt-br__ So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this mural , that &apos;s a Chris Ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
__pt-br__ So we rented this space .
__pt-br__ And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
__pt-br__ You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
__pt-br__ You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
__pt-br__ It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
__pt-br__ We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look — while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
__pt-br__ And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
__pt-br__ You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
__pt-br__ A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate supply-like .
__pt-br__ Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
__pt-br__ We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
__pt-br__ Up at the top , you see the eyepatch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch , and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mitzvahs and whatever .
__pt-br__ So we opened this place . And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
__pt-br__ This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
__pt-br__ These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Practical Joking with Pirates . &quot;
__pt-br__ While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
__pt-br__ That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
__pt-br__ It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
__pt-br__ So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
__pt-br__ The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
__pt-br__ We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
__pt-br__ We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
__pt-br__ I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle .
__pt-br__ Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
__pt-br__ It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
__pt-br__ And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
__pt-br__ And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
__pt-br__ And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
__pt-br__ And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
__pt-br__ And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari , a longtime San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
__pt-br__ She took over as executive director .
__pt-br__ Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
__pt-br__ And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
__pt-br__ The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
__pt-br__ You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
__pt-br__ And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
__pt-br__ They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored .
__pt-br__ So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
__pt-br__ And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
__pt-br__ If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
__pt-br__ But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
__pt-br__ And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
__pt-br__ Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
__pt-br__ First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
__pt-br__ And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
__pt-br__ And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
__pt-br__ And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
__pt-br__ They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
__pt-br__ So there &apos;s no stigma .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
__pt-br__ These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
__pt-br__ They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at McSweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
__pt-br__ But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
__pt-br__ They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
__pt-br__ They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
__pt-br__ And that makes a happy family .
__pt-br__ A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
__pt-br__ A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
__pt-br__ So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
__pt-br__ So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
__pt-br__ And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster .
__pt-br__ And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
__pt-br__ The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
__pt-br__ So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
__pt-br__ Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
__pt-br__ So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
__pt-br__ This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
__pt-br__ You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
__pt-br__ So this is one of the books that they do .
__pt-br__ Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic . &quot;
__pt-br__ And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
__pt-br__ So then we still had more tutors to use .
__pt-br__ This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
__pt-br__ The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
__pt-br__ We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
__pt-br__ The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
__pt-br__ The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
__pt-br__ Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
__pt-br__ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
__pt-br__ We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
__pt-br__ Whoever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
__pt-br__ The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
__pt-br__ They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
__pt-br__ So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
__pt-br__ Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Everett Middle School Writers &apos; Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
__pt-br__ This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight-Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages — English and Spanish .
__pt-br__ So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
__pt-br__ I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
__pt-br__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
__pt-br__ She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
__pt-br__ She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
__pt-br__ I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
__pt-br__ We had a big party at the end .
__pt-br__ This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
__pt-br__ You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
__pt-br__ And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
__pt-br__ Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
__pt-br__ The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
__pt-br__ And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
__pt-br__ And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
__pt-br__ We sell all the student books .
__pt-br__ Where else would you put them , right ?
__pt-br__ So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money .
__pt-br__ So it was paying the rent .
__pt-br__ And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
__pt-br__ But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
__pt-br__ It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
__pt-br__ And it became a gateway to the community .
__pt-br__ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
__pt-br__ What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
__pt-br__ They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
__pt-br__ And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
__pt-br__ This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
__pt-br__ So the store actually did really well .
__pt-br__ But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
__pt-br__ It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
__pt-br__ So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
__pt-br__ So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
__pt-br__ They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
__pt-br__ They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
__pt-br__ So , knowing the crime-fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company .
__pt-br__ This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
__pt-br__ And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
__pt-br__ So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Costco for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
__pt-br__ These are all handmade .
__pt-br__ These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
__pt-br__ All the packaging is done by Sam Potts .
__pt-br__ So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
__pt-br__ This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
__pt-br__ Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
__pt-br__ Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
__pt-br__ These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
__pt-br__ This is a secret identity kit .
__pt-br__ If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Hoboken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
__pt-br__ So , this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that .
__pt-br__ So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
__pt-br__ You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
__pt-br__ It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
__pt-br__ But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
__pt-br__ All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
__pt-br__ I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
__pt-br__ And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
__pt-br__ So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
__pt-br__ This is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
__pt-br__ You can read this quote .
__pt-br__ Addicted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
__pt-br__ Came in . Got this concentrated attention .
__pt-br__ And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
__pt-br__ So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
__pt-br__ So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s now been published in five books .
__pt-br__ He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super-Has-Beens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Penguin Balboa , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
__pt-br__ And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
__pt-br__ He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
__pt-br__ So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
__pt-br__ This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers .
__pt-br__ So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-Eleven would be .
__pt-br__ Leeches . Mammoth chunks . They even have their own Slurpee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Order . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
__pt-br__ These are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pittsfield , Massachusetts ; Ink Spot in Cincinnati ; Youth Speaks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin Bat Cave in Austin ; Fighting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Roddy Doyle , this will be open in April .
__pt-br__ Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
__pt-br__ All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
__pt-br__ Profound leaps forward !
__pt-br__ And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
__pt-br__ I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
__pt-br__ I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
__pt-br__ We created a website .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
__pt-br__ We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
__pt-br__ Always let the teachers lead the way .
__pt-br__ They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
__pt-br__ There are a million ways .
__pt-br__ You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
__pt-br__ So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
__pt-br__ This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
__pt-br__ This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
__pt-br__ Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
__pt-br__ If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
__pt-br__ You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
__pt-br__ And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
__pt-br__ And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureaucratically untenable .
__pt-br__ You can do and use the skills that you have .
__pt-br__ The schools need you . The teachers need you .
__pt-br__ Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
__pt-br__ Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
__pt-br__ You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
__pt-br__ Thank you so much .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
__pt-br__ And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
__pt-br__ And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day .
__pt-br__ And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hallelujah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
__pt-br__ My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
__pt-br__ But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
__pt-br__ I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laughed .
__pt-br__ And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
__pt-br__ And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
__pt-br__ Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
__pt-br__ My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
__pt-br__ It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
__pt-br__ That ’ s a big thing in California .
__pt-br__ And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
__pt-br__ And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
__pt-br__ And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
__pt-br__ You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
__pt-br__ Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
__pt-br__ And so I argued with people about that , I argued and I argued .
__pt-br__ I called my parents up .
__pt-br__ I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
__pt-br__ They ’ re back in Philadelphia .
__pt-br__ And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mothers are like that .
__pt-br__ And so , on my 27th birthday I decided , because I argued so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
__pt-br__ And so I did .
__pt-br__ I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
__pt-br__ And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
__pt-br__ And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
__pt-br__ Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
__pt-br__ And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
__pt-br__ And then I would launch in .
__pt-br__ Well , that just ended communication .
__pt-br__ So on this first day I actually listened .
__pt-br__ And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
__pt-br__ I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
__pt-br__ I didn ’ t .
__pt-br__ And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
__pt-br__ So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
__pt-br__ Well , that lasted 17 years .
__pt-br__ Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
__pt-br__ And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
__pt-br__ I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
__pt-br__ It ’ s only 500 miles .
__pt-br__ And I went into the Registrar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
__pt-br__ I had a newspaper clipping .
__pt-br__ &quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
__pt-br__ You don ’ t … ?
__pt-br__ We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
__pt-br__ And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
__pt-br__ And my father came out , he was so proud .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor ’ s degree ?
__pt-br__ You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
__pt-br__ I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana .
__pt-br__ I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
__pt-br__ I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
__pt-br__ There are two stories in Montana .
__pt-br__ The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
__pt-br__ And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Register for one credit .
__pt-br__ You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , South America .
__pt-br__ So I did that .
__pt-br__ He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate — you ’ re matriculating , so you can use the library .
__pt-br__ And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
__pt-br__ They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
__pt-br__ But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
__pt-br__ They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
__pt-br__ And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
__pt-br__ I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
__pt-br__ I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
__pt-br__ All the students sat around and they went ...
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
__pt-br__ They had to take that class with me .
__pt-br__ Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
__pt-br__ And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
__pt-br__ and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a handsaw . &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; Well , you can ’ t clearcut with a ... &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about selective forestry . &quot;
__pt-br__ Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
__pt-br__ I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
__pt-br__ But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
__pt-br__ And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
__pt-br__ And so I went on .
__pt-br__ My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
__pt-br__ What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hunched my shoulder , I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin .
__pt-br__ I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
__pt-br__ No one was interested in oil spills .
__pt-br__ But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
__pt-br__ And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
__pt-br__ My dad came out again .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
__pt-br__ My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
__pt-br__ I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
__pt-br__ And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
__pt-br__ And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
__pt-br__ And I ’ m thanking you , and I &apos;m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
__pt-br__ And that ’ s communication .
__pt-br__ And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
__pt-br__ And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
__pt-br__ Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
__pt-br__ Well , my journey kept going on .
__pt-br__ My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
__pt-br__ I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
__pt-br__ I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
__pt-br__ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
__pt-br__ &quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
__pt-br__ How could that be , how could that be ?
__pt-br__ How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
__pt-br__ Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
__pt-br__ And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
__pt-br__ And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
__pt-br__ I started talking because I had studied environment .
__pt-br__ I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
__pt-br__ And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
__pt-br__ And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
__pt-br__ Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
__pt-br__ And so that ’ s the message that I had .
__pt-br__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
__pt-br__ This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motorized vehicles .
__pt-br__ I was walking through El Dorado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in Venezuela , and I don ’ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
__pt-br__ There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; Pasaporte , pasaporte , &quot; &quot; and with an M16 pointed at me .
__pt-br__ And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
__pt-br__ What possessed me to say this thing ?
__pt-br__ The road turned into the jungle .
__pt-br__ I didn ’ t get shot .
__pt-br__ And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Almighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
__pt-br__ It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
__pt-br__ I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
__pt-br__ The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
__pt-br__ Now how could that be ?
__pt-br__ Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
__pt-br__ But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
__pt-br__ I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador .
__pt-br__ I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
__pt-br__ And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
__pt-br__ You know , we can do it .
__pt-br__ I was going to have to change .
__pt-br__ And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
__pt-br__ I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
__pt-br__ I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
__pt-br__ But I know I needed to .
__pt-br__ I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
__pt-br__ And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
__pt-br__ And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
__pt-br__ And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
__pt-br__ We have to change now .
__pt-br__ As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists .
__pt-br__ So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
__pt-br__ And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
__pt-br__ So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
__pt-br__ Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
__pt-br__ So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the latest episode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — longest running soap opera , which is cricket .
__pt-br__ And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue .
__pt-br__ And like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s exactly what cricket has done .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20-over game .
__pt-br__ And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
__pt-br__ But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
__pt-br__ Cricket wasn &apos;t always this speed-driven generations game .
__pt-br__ There was a time when you played cricket , you played timeless test matches , when you played on till the game got over .
__pt-br__ And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March .
__pt-br__ And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town , which is a two-hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
__pt-br__ So , the match was ended in between .
__pt-br__ And one of the English batsmen said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__pt-br__ Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
__pt-br__ There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days , so you don &apos;t play on Sundays . And one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
__pt-br__ But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket : because we had about the same pace of life .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) The Mahabharata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
__pt-br__ You fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
__pt-br__ And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
__pt-br__ The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
__pt-br__ Princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers .
__pt-br__ But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
__pt-br__ Take a look : You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges — that &apos;s as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time .
__pt-br__ Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
__pt-br__ But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
__pt-br__ You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket .
__pt-br__ And then an enormous accident took place .
__pt-br__ In Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
__pt-br__ And we won this World Cup in 1983 .
__pt-br__ And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game , and we played it virtually every day .
__pt-br__ There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere .
__pt-br__ But there was another big date .
__pt-br__ 1983 was when we won the World Cup .
__pt-br__ 1991 , &apos; 92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .
__pt-br__ And so we allowed multinationals into India .
__pt-br__ We cut customs duties , we reduced import duties , and we got all the multinationals coming in , with multinational budgets , who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
__pt-br__ And there are only two vehicles in India — one real , one scripted .
__pt-br__ The scripted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cricket .
__pt-br__ And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
__pt-br__ And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over .
__pt-br__ And so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in .
__pt-br__ Television started covering cricket . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
__pt-br__ The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
__pt-br__ And then another big accident happened in our cricket .
__pt-br__ England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
__pt-br__ Thank God for them .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see .
__pt-br__ India didn &apos;t want to play the T20 World Cup .
__pt-br__ But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin .
__pt-br__ And then something very dramatic happened .
__pt-br__ We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look .
__pt-br__ ( Crowd cheering ) The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder .
__pt-br__ Announcer : And Zishan takes it ! India wins !
__pt-br__ What a match for a Twenty20 final .
__pt-br__ India , the world champions .
__pt-br__ ( Cheering ) India , T20 champions .
__pt-br__ But what a game we had , M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air , but Misbah-ul-Haq , what a player .
__pt-br__ A massive , massive success : India , the world TT champions .
__pt-br__ Harsha Bhogle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket .
__pt-br__ The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) If he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
__pt-br__ And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
__pt-br__ It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
__pt-br__ And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
__pt-br__ And thankfully for all of us , the English are very good at inventing things , and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And so England invented T20 cricket , and allowed India to hijack it .
__pt-br__ It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T20 league .
__pt-br__ Six weeks , city versus city .
__pt-br__ It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
__pt-br__ One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
__pt-br__ The other was Indian cricket .
__pt-br__ Now , suddenly we had to support city leagues .
__pt-br__ But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West .
__pt-br__ America is a home of leagues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some glitzy leagues here in India . &quot;
__pt-br__ But was India ready for it ?
__pt-br__ Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized .
__pt-br__ It was never promoted , it was never sold — it was organized .
__pt-br__ And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
__pt-br__ All of a sudden , you had that happening .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) An opening ceremony to match every other .
__pt-br__ This was an India that was buying Corvettes . This was an India that was buying Jaguar .
__pt-br__ This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand &apos;s population twice over .
__pt-br__ So , it was a different India .
__pt-br__ But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
__pt-br__ And so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .
__pt-br__ Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes .
__pt-br__ They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
__pt-br__ And so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time .
__pt-br__ And they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
__pt-br__ I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues .
__pt-br__ But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized .
__pt-br__ So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Manchester United style promotion , but very Mumbai style promotion . Take a look .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .
__pt-br__ All along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .
__pt-br__ Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot — if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they needn &apos;t go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad .
__pt-br__ This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
__pt-br__ And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
__pt-br__ So , the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago , overnight . And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X. &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Fine , you play to date X , minus one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game ,
__pt-br__ went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet — first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) Never would India have thought on this scale before .
__pt-br__ Never would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
__pt-br__ We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment .
__pt-br__ There is cricket and the movies .
__pt-br__ And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs .
__pt-br__ And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta .
__pt-br__ They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .
__pt-br__ And something very interesting happened .
__pt-br__ We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket .
__pt-br__ And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more .
__pt-br__ And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that follows — if you did well , you got a hug from Preity Zinta .
__pt-br__ So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching Preity Zinta .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd .
__pt-br__ We &apos;d all seen matches in Kolkata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Shah Rukh , with the Bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata — not for India , but for Kolkata .
__pt-br__ But take a look at this .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they &apos;d won in Kolkata .
__pt-br__ Can you imagine ?
__pt-br__ And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said ?
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta &apos;s team . &quot;
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pakistan in here .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
__pt-br__ We can play cricket together , we can be friends .
__pt-br__ So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) There was criticism too because they said , &quot; &quot; Players are being bought and sold ?
__pt-br__ Are they grain ?
__pt-br__ Are they cattle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auction , you see .
__pt-br__ How do you fix a price for a player ?
__pt-br__ And so the auction that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so-and-so player . &quot;
__pt-br__ There it is .
__pt-br__ ( Music ) Auctioneer : Going at 1,500,000 dollars . Chennai .
__pt-br__ Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars .
__pt-br__ HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day — so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
__pt-br__ The best Indian players who played every test match — every one of the internationals , the top of the line players — standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year .
__pt-br__ Now they were getting 500,000 for six days &apos; work .
__pt-br__ Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , and I &apos;m earning more than the footballers , wow . &quot; &quot; And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India .
__pt-br__ Could you have imagined that day would come ?
__pt-br__ One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
__pt-br__ That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
__pt-br__ So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .
__pt-br__ What India was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
__pt-br__ Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today .
__pt-br__ IPL became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .
__pt-br__ Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks .
__pt-br__ But we did it . You know why ?
__pt-br__ Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching — the huge consuming class — everybody came to watch the cricket .
__pt-br__ We &apos;d also made cricket the only sport in India , which is a pity , but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
__pt-br__ Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
__pt-br__ For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beggars , snake charmers , filth , Delhi belly — people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .
__pt-br__ And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
__pt-br__ Cricketers all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
__pt-br__ And that felt good , you know ?
__pt-br__ We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Delhi belly in there anymore .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules .
__pt-br__ Right so , finally , an English game that India usurped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .
__pt-br__ If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shortest form of the game .
__pt-br__ You can &apos;t take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
__pt-br__ So that &apos;s what T20 is doing .
__pt-br__ Hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cricket commentators more time in the business .
__pt-br__ Thank you very much . Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street .
__pt-br__ This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
__pt-br__ Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
__pt-br__ So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
__pt-br__ They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
__pt-br__ Blocks have names .
__pt-br__ Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
__pt-br__ All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
__pt-br__ And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
__pt-br__ The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
__pt-br__ The second house ever built is house number two .
__pt-br__ Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
__pt-br__ So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
__pt-br__ So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
__pt-br__ But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
__pt-br__ So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
__pt-br__ And this map is also accurate .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
__pt-br__ So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
__pt-br__ Domo arigato gozaimashita .
__pt-br__ So when I meet refugees , I always ask them questions .
__pt-br__ Who bombed your house ?
__pt-br__ Who killed your son ?
__pt-br__ Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
__pt-br__ How are you coping in your life in exile ?
__pt-br__ But there &apos;s one question that always seems to me to be most revealing , and that is : What did you take ?
__pt-br__ What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town , and the armed gangs were approaching your house ?
__pt-br__ A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn &apos;t hesitate when his life was in imminent danger .
__pt-br__ He took his high school diploma , and later he told me why .
__pt-br__ He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that diploma .
__pt-br__ On his way to school , he would dodge snipers .
__pt-br__ His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; Every day , I would say to him every morning , &apos; Honey , please don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he insisted , she said , &quot; I would hug him as if it were for the last time . &quot;
__pt-br__ But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all afraid , but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got terrible news .
__pt-br__ It was time to flee .
__pt-br__ They left that day , right away , in their car , Hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers .
__pt-br__ And they would cross the border into Lebanon , where they would find peace .
__pt-br__ But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony .
__pt-br__ They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field , and this is Hany &apos;s brother Ashraf , who plays outside .
__pt-br__ And that day , they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world , in a country , Lebanon , that is tiny .
__pt-br__ It only has four million citizens , and there are one million Syrian refugees living there .
__pt-br__ There &apos;s not a town , a city or a village that is not host to Syrian refugees .
__pt-br__ This is generosity and humanity that is remarkable .
__pt-br__ Think about it this way , proportionately .
__pt-br__ Six and a half million people have fled for their lives .
__pt-br__ Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries , and only a small proportion , as you see , have moved on to Europe .
__pt-br__ What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children .
__pt-br__ I took this picture of this little girl .
__pt-br__ It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan .
__pt-br__ And most troubling of all is that only 20 percent of Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon .
__pt-br__ And yet , Syrian refugee children , all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives .
__pt-br__ Why ? Because it allows them to think of their future rather than the nightmare of their past .
__pt-br__ It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred .
__pt-br__ I &apos;m reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq , and I met this girl , and I thought , &quot; &quot; She &apos;s beautiful , &quot; &quot; and I went up to her and asked her , &quot; Can I take your picture ? &quot;
__pt-br__ And she said yes , but she refused to smile .
__pt-br__ I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children , a generation isolated and frustrated .
__pt-br__ And yet , look at what they fled : utter destruction , buildings , industries , schools , roads , homes .
__pt-br__ Hany &apos;s home was also destroyed .
__pt-br__ This will need to be rebuilt by architects , by engineers , by electricians .
__pt-br__ Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge .
__pt-br__ Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return .
__pt-br__ You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state .
__pt-br__ Well far from it .
__pt-br__ With wars going on and on , the average time a refugee will spend in exile is 17 years .
__pt-br__ Hany was into his second year in limbo when I went to visit him recently , and we conducted our entire conversation in English , which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown &apos;s novels and from listening to American rap .
__pt-br__ We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf .
__pt-br__ But I &apos;ll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day .
__pt-br__ He said to me , &quot; If I am not a student , I am nothing . &quot;
__pt-br__ Hany is one of 50 million people uprooted in this world today .
__pt-br__ Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced .
__pt-br__ So while we &apos;re making sweeping progress in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes .
__pt-br__ And there are more and more victims .
__pt-br__ Every day , on average , by the end of this day , 32,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes — 32,000 people .
__pt-br__ They flee across borders like this one .
__pt-br__ We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan , and this is a typical day .
__pt-br__ Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats , risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe .
__pt-br__ This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized — most of the people drowned — and he told us , &quot; &quot; Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you , where nobody humiliates you , and where nobody kills you . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that should be the minimum .
__pt-br__ How about a place of healing , of learning , and even opportunity ?
__pt-br__ Americans and Europeans have the impression that proportionally huge numbers of refugees are coming to their country , but the reality is that 86 percent , the vast majority of refugees , are living in the developing world , in countries struggling with their own insecurity , with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty .
__pt-br__ So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees .
__pt-br__ And all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__pt-br__ But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive .
__pt-br__ We can help them thrive .
__pt-br__ We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end .
__pt-br__ Rather , as centers of excellence , where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation .
__pt-br__ It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m reminded of the terrible war in Somalia that has been raging on for 22 years .
__pt-br__ And imagine living in this camp .
__pt-br__ I visited this camp .
__pt-br__ It &apos;s in Djibouti , neighboring Somalia , and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there .
__pt-br__ It was dusty and it was terribly hot .
__pt-br__ And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children , and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter , and I went up and talked to her .
__pt-br__ And I asked her the questions that grown-ups ask kids , like , &quot; &quot; What is your favorite subject ? &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; &quot; And this is when her face turned blank , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I have no future .
__pt-br__ My schooling days are over . &quot; &quot; And I thought , there must be some misunderstanding , so I turned to my colleague and she confirmed to me there is no funding for secondary education in this camp .
__pt-br__ And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her , &quot; We will build you a school . &quot;
__pt-br__ And I also thought , what a waste .
__pt-br__ She should be and she is the future of Somalia .
__pt-br__ A boy named Jacob Atem had a different chance , but not before he experienced terribly tragedy .
__pt-br__ He watched — this is in Sudan — as his village — he was only seven years old — burned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day .
__pt-br__ But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States , and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) I spoke to him on Skype the other day , and he was in his new university in Florida pursuing his Ph.D. in public health , and he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the American public to establish a health clinic back in his village back home .
__pt-br__ So I want to take you back to Hany .
__pt-br__ When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage , he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me .
__pt-br__ My room , my books , myself , and everything that was making me smile .
__pt-br__ Oh , oh , I had so many dreams that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity .
__pt-br__ Leave them abandoned , and they risk exploitation and abuse , and leave them unskilled and uneducated , and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries .
__pt-br__ I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world .
__pt-br__ The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace , and it &apos;s the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence .
__pt-br__ Hany is at a tipping point .
__pt-br__ We would love to help him go to university and to become an engineer , but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life : tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets , food rations and a bit of medicine .
__pt-br__ University is a luxury .
__pt-br__ But leave him to languish in this muddy field , and he will become a member of a lost generation .
__pt-br__ Hany &apos;s story is a tragedy , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
__pt-br__ Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
__pt-br__ And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
__pt-br__ That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 .
__pt-br__ As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
__pt-br__ After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken &apos;s book , &quot; The Ecology of Commerce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
__pt-br__ In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
__pt-br__ And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
__pt-br__ And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
__pt-br__ Take nothing : do no harm .
__pt-br__ I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
__pt-br__ Unless somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s axiomatic . Why not us ?
__pt-br__ And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
__pt-br__ And that became the headline of a Fortune article .
__pt-br__ They went on to describe me as America &apos;s greenest CEO .
__pt-br__ From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America &apos;s greenest CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
__pt-br__ Asked later in the Canadian documentary , &quot; &quot; The Corporation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I offered that theft is a crime .
__pt-br__ And theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
__pt-br__ But I realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
__pt-br__ According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
__pt-br__ That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
__pt-br__ And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
__pt-br__ So the equation is conceptual .
__pt-br__ Still it works to help us understand the problem .
__pt-br__ So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
__pt-br__ Paul and Anne Ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , affluence and technology .
__pt-br__ I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T.
__pt-br__ Now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the denominator decreases impact .
__pt-br__ So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numerator — call it T1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it T2 — where it reduces impact ?
__pt-br__ I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics .
__pt-br__ Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
__pt-br__ Linear : take , make , waste .
__pt-br__ Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
__pt-br__ Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
__pt-br__ More carpet per man-hour .
__pt-br__ Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .
__pt-br__ In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
__pt-br__ And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
__pt-br__ And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
__pt-br__ We have measured our progress very rigorously .
__pt-br__ So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
__pt-br__ Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
__pt-br__ ( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
__pt-br__ So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
__pt-br__ This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
__pt-br__ Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
__pt-br__ The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
__pt-br__ Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
__pt-br__ Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious .
__pt-br__ Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
__pt-br__ Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
__pt-br__ We have diverted 148 million pounds — that &apos;s 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
__pt-br__ Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
__pt-br__ We call it Cool Carpet .
__pt-br__ And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
__pt-br__ Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F-L-O-R .
__pt-br__ You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
__pt-br__ It is practical , and pretty too .
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
__pt-br__ We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
__pt-br__ We call this Mission Zero .
__pt-br__ And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
__pt-br__ A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
__pt-br__ Here is the business case for sustainability .
__pt-br__ From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of Mount Sustainability .
__pt-br__ This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .
__pt-br__ And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
__pt-br__ Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
__pt-br__ Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
__pt-br__ You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
__pt-br__ And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
__pt-br__ No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
__pt-br__ Costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
__pt-br__ It is a better business model .
__pt-br__ And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
__pt-br__ There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
__pt-br__ But the marketplace was down 36 percent .
__pt-br__ We literally gained market share .
__pt-br__ We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
__pt-br__ If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
__pt-br__ I don &apos;t think so .
__pt-br__ I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 .
__pt-br__ That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
__pt-br__ But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?
__pt-br__ And what if we made A a lowercase &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
__pt-br__ You know that would reframe civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
__pt-br__ But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
__pt-br__ Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
__pt-br__ At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
__pt-br__ We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
__pt-br__ And now the challenge is in execution .
__pt-br__ And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
__pt-br__ ( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
__pt-br__ If we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
__pt-br__ And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
__pt-br__ Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
__pt-br__ Who is that person ?
__pt-br__ Not you . Not I.
__pt-br__ But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
__pt-br__ And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
__pt-br__ On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
__pt-br__ But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
__pt-br__ He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .
__pt-br__ And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
__pt-br__ Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
__pt-br__ Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
__pt-br__ Please meet &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow &apos;s child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn .
__pt-br__ A wise friend introduced us two .
__pt-br__ And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
__pt-br__ Knowing you has changed my thinking .
__pt-br__ For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you .
__pt-br__ Tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
__pt-br__ Begin , I will .
__pt-br__ The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tomorrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you .
__pt-br__ We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
__pt-br__ The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
__pt-br__ And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
__pt-br__ For you , it &apos;s your call .
__pt-br__ Thank you .
__pt-br__ ( Applause )
