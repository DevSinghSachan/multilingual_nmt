__bs__ I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
__bs__ We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes .
__bs__ The Sun burns our peripheral vision .
__bs__ We see light reflected off the Moon .
__bs__ And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies , the known universe has come to us through light , across vast eras in cosmic history .
__bs__ And with all of our modern telescopes , we &apos;ve been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe — these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang .
__bs__ And yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
__bs__ I &apos;d like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum .
__bs__ It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold .
__bs__ Now we &apos;d like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe — a sonic composition .
__bs__ And while we &apos;ve never heard the sounds from space , we really should , in the next few years , start to turn up the volume on what &apos;s going on out there .
__bs__ So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which I &apos;d like to play for you — some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
__bs__ Now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
__bs__ We can &apos;t see them directly .
__bs__ They &apos;re not brought to us with light , at least not directly .
__bs__ We can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
__bs__ They destroy stars around them .
__bs__ They churn up debris in their surroundings .
__bs__ But they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
__bs__ We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background , but we haven &apos;t yet .
__bs__ And yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
__bs__ Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein — to whom we owe so much .
__bs__ Einstein realized that if space were empty , if the universe were empty , it would be like this picture , except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .
__bs__ But if we were freely falling through the space , even without this helpful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines , undeflected straight paths through the universe .
__bs__ Einstein also realized — and this is the real meat of the matter — that if you put energy or mass in the universe , it would curve space , and a freely falling object would pass by , let &apos;s say , the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space .
__bs__ It was Einstein &apos;s great general theory of relativity .
__bs__ Now even light will be bent by those paths .
__bs__ And you can be bent so much that you &apos;re caught in orbit around the Sun , as the Earth is , or the Moon around the Earth .
__bs__ These are the natural curves in space .
__bs__ What Einstein did not realize was that , if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers — so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape — a dark shadow against the universe .
__bs__ It wasn &apos;t Einstein who realized this , it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I — joined the German army already an accomplished scientist , working on the Russian front .
__bs__ I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire , and then , in between , calculating Einstein &apos;s equations — as you do in the trenches .
__bs__ And he was reading Einstein &apos;s recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
__bs__ And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary : curves so strong that space would rain down into them , space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole .
__bs__ And even light could not escape this current .
__bs__ Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a shadow .
__bs__ Now he wrote to Einstein , and he said , &quot; &quot; As you will see , the war has been kind to me enough .
__bs__ Despite the heavy gunfire , I &apos;ve been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas . &quot; &quot; And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution , and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist .
__bs__ This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
__bs__ And he took Schwarzschild &apos;s idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week .
__bs__ But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
__bs__ He did not believe they existed in nature .
__bs__ He thought nature would protect us from their formation .
__bs__ It was decades before the term &quot; &quot; black hole &quot; &quot; was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects — in fact they &apos;re the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime .
__bs__ Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole .
__bs__ It &apos;s actually not massive enough .
__bs__ But if we did a little thought experiment — as Einstein was very fond of doing — we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers , and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit , maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun .
__bs__ And it would be self-illuminated , because now the Sun &apos;s gone , we have no other source of light — so let &apos;s make our little Earth self-illuminated .
__bs__ And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole .
__bs__ This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan , more or less .
__bs__ It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth .
__bs__ But basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
__bs__ We &apos;re talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan .
__bs__ So we move this Earth very close — 30 kilometers outside — and we notice it &apos;s perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole .
__bs__ There &apos;s a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in .
__bs__ But what &apos;s very impressive is that , from our vantage point , we can always see the Earth .
__bs__ It cannot hide behind the black hole .
__bs__ The light from the Earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
__bs__ So you can &apos;t hide anything behind a black hole .
__bs__ If this were Battlestar Galactica and you &apos;re fighting the Cylons , don &apos;t hide behind the black hole .
__bs__ They can see you .
__bs__ Now , our Sun will not collapse to a black hole — it &apos;s not massive enough — but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy .
__bs__ And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way , this is what it would look like .
__bs__ We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes .
__bs__ And if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
__bs__ It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can escape .
__bs__ But even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it &apos;s not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
__bs__ And even though , due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation , our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time , it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us , right before we were crushed to death by the black hole .
__bs__ It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it &apos;s a total death experience .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And there &apos;s no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel .
__bs__ Now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
__bs__ Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation — imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together .
__bs__ Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes — each one 10 times the mass of the Sun .
__bs__ So now we &apos;re going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across .
__bs__ They can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
__bs__ At the end of their lives , they &apos;re going around each other very near the speed of light .
__bs__ So they &apos;re crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
__bs__ Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .
__bs__ And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
__bs__ This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard .
__bs__ It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
__bs__ This was one of the groups .
__bs__ It shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
__bs__ And if you can see — it &apos;s kind of faint — but if you can see the red waves emanating out , those are the gravitational waves .
__bs__ They &apos;re literally the sounds of space ringing , and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning , quiet black hole at the end of the day .
__bs__ If you were standing near enough , your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space .
__bs__ You would literally hear the sound .
__bs__ Now of course , your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully , so you might have trouble understanding what &apos;s going on .
__bs__ But I &apos;d like to play for you the sound that we predict .
__bs__ This is from my group — a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
__bs__ Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
__bs__ The sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
__bs__ If it gets far away , it &apos;s a little too quiet .
__bs__ But it comes in like a mallet , and it literally cracks space , wobbling it like a drum .
__bs__ And we can predict what the sound will be .
__bs__ We know that , as it falls in , it gets faster and it gets louder .
__bs__ And eventually , we &apos;re going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy .
__bs__ ( Thumping ) Then it &apos;s gone .
__bs__ Now I &apos;ve never heard it that loud — it &apos;s actually more dramatic .
__bs__ At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
__bs__ It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
__bs__ This is another sound from my group .
__bs__ No , I &apos;m not showing you any images , because black holes don &apos;t leave behind helpful trails of ink , and space is not painted , showing you the curves .
__bs__ But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this , you want to get moving .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Want to get away from the sound .
__bs__ Both black holes are moving .
__bs__ Both black holes are getting closer together .
__bs__ In this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
__bs__ And then they &apos;re going to merge .
__bs__ ( Thumping ) Now it &apos;s gone .
__bs__ Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging — that it chirps up at the end .
__bs__ Now that &apos;s our prediction for what we &apos;ll see .
__bs__ Luckily we &apos;re at this safe distance in Long Beach , California .
__bs__ And surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
__bs__ And surely , the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us .
__bs__ But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
__bs__ There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth — one called LIGO — which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .
__bs__ It &apos;s a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it &apos;s going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years — to pick this up .
__bs__ There &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called LISA .
__bs__ And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes — black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun .
__bs__ In this Hubble image , we see two galaxies .
__bs__ They look like they &apos;re frozen in some embrace .
__bs__ And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core .
__bs__ But they &apos;re not frozen ; they &apos;re actually merging .
__bs__ These two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
__bs__ It &apos;s beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration .
__bs__ But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe &apos;s history , the last 15 minutes before they fall together .
__bs__ And it &apos;s not just black holes , but it &apos;s also any big disturbance in the universe — and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang .
__bs__ When that expression was coined , it was derisive — like , &quot; &quot; Oh , who would believe in a Big Bang ? &quot; &quot; But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang .
__bs__ It might make a sound .
__bs__ This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside .
__bs__ We don &apos;t ever want to do that actually . We want to be inside the universe because there &apos;s no such thing as standing outside the universe .
__bs__ So imagine you &apos;re inside the Big Bang .
__bs__ It &apos;s everywhere , it &apos;s all around you , and the space is wobbling chaotically .
__bs__ Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
__bs__ Galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habitable planet .
__bs__ And here we are frantically building these experiments , doing these calculations , writing these computer codes .
__bs__ Imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
__bs__ That song has been ringing through space for all that time .
__bs__ We weren &apos;t even here .
__bs__ It gets closer and closer — 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
__bs__ It &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
__bs__ It &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
__bs__ whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity — we &apos;ll build them , we &apos;ll turn on the machines and , bang , we &apos;ll catch it — the first song from space .
__bs__ If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up , it would sound like this .
__bs__ ( Static ) It &apos;s a terrible sound .
__bs__ It &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
__bs__ It &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
__bs__ But it &apos;s around us everywhere , presumably , if it hasn &apos;t been wiped out by some other process in the universe .
__bs__ And if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observable universe .
__bs__ So within the next few years , we &apos;ll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit , render the universe in audio .
__bs__ But if we detect those earliest moments , it &apos;ll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang , which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest , most elusive , questions .
__bs__ If we run the movie of our universe backwards , we know that there was a Big Bang in our past , and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it , but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang ?
__bs__ I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
__bs__ Will it happen again ?
__bs__ I mean , in the spirit of rising to TED &apos;s challenge to reignite wonder , we can ask questions , at least for this last minute , that honestly might evade us forever .
__bs__ But we have to ask : Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history ?
__bs__ Or , is it possible that we &apos;re just a branch off of a multiverse — each branch with its own Big Bang in its past — maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without — maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without — not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ?
__bs__ So we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
__bs__ Here &apos;s my multiverse creatures .
__bs__ Are there other creatures in the multiverse , wondering about us and wondering about their own origins ?
__bs__ And if they are , I can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
__bs__ Thank you . Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ These are grim economic times , fellow TEDsters , grim economic times indeed .
__bs__ And so , I would like to cheer you up with one of the great , albeit largely unknown , commercial success stories of the past 20 years .
__bs__ Comparable , in its own very peculiar way , to the achievements of Microsoft or Google .
__bs__ And it &apos;s an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity .
__bs__ I refer to organized crime .
__bs__ Now organized crime has been around for a very long time , I hear you say , and these would be wise words , indeed .
__bs__ But in the last two decades , it has experienced an unprecedented expansion , now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world &apos;s GDP .
__bs__ I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy , or McMafia , for short .
__bs__ So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ?
__bs__ Well , of course , there is globalization , technology , communications , all that stuff , which we &apos;ll talk about a little bit later .
__bs__ But first , I would like to take you back to this event : the collapse of communism .
__bs__ All across Eastern Europe , a most momentous episode in our post-war history .
__bs__ Now it &apos;s time for full disclosure .
__bs__ This event meant a great deal to me personally .
__bs__ I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe , like Solidarity in Poland , when I was in my teens .
__bs__ I then started writing about Eastern Europe , and eventually I became the BBC &apos;s chief correspondent for the region , which is what I was doing in 1989 .
__bs__ And so when 425 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments , I was ecstatic , but I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall .
__bs__ It wasn &apos;t long , for example , before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia .
__bs__ And amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in Eastern Europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there .
__bs__ Obviously there were characters like this .
__bs__ But there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe .
__bs__ Like this character . Remember these guys ?
__bs__ They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling , every four years in the Olympics , and they were the great celebrities of communism , with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it .
__bs__ They used to get great apartments in the center of town , casual sex on tap , and they could travel to the West very freely , which was a great luxury at the time .
__bs__ It may come as a surprise , but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe .
__bs__ Or as I like to call them , they are the midwives of capitalism .
__bs__ Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover .
__bs__ Now in Bulgaria — this photograph was taken in Bulgaria — when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe , it wasn &apos;t just communism ; it was the state that collapsed as well .
__bs__ That means your police force wasn &apos;t working .
__bs__ The court system wasn &apos;t functioning properly .
__bs__ So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored ?
__bs__ Well , he would turn to people who were called , rather prosaically by sociologists , privatized law enforcement agencies .
__bs__ We prefer to know them as the mafia .
__bs__ And in Bulgaria , the mafia was soon joined with 14,000 people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991 .
__bs__ Now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks and killing people .
__bs__ But that &apos;s what happened all over Eastern Europe .
__bs__ Now , when I was working in the 1990s , I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia .
__bs__ And I couldn &apos;t help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities , the paramilitary organizations , were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates .
__bs__ And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise .
__bs__ And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen , by talking to victims , by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services .
__bs__ But above all else , by talking to the gangsters themselves .
__bs__ And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start .
__bs__ Why ? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing , but also , as they say in the retail trade , it &apos;s location , location , location .
__bs__ And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world .
__bs__ Heroin , cocaine , women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals .
__bs__ And where were they heading ?
__bs__ The European Union , which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization , transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history , eventually comprising some 500 million people .
__bs__ And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes , sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers .
__bs__ Now , organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business .
__bs__ It has zones of production , like Afghanistan and Columbia .
__bs__ It has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans .
__bs__ And then , of course , it has zones of consumption , like the European Union , Japan and of course , the United States .
__bs__ The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed .
__bs__ Take Mexico , for example .
__bs__ Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade .
__bs__ But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo ?
__bs__ Since 1998 , five million people have died there .
__bs__ It &apos;s not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers , but it &apos;s the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War .
__bs__ And why is it ? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region .
__bs__ In the year 2000 , 80 percent of the world &apos;s coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo .
__bs__ Now , coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone , in almost every laptop and games console .
__bs__ The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons , and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets .
__bs__ And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime .
__bs__ Now , let me show you some of my friends in action , caught conveniently on film by the Italian police , and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes .
__bs__ Now , cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap .
__bs__ The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world .
__bs__ So if you can smuggle them into the E.U. , there are very handsome profits to be made , and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups .
__bs__ This boat is worth one million Euros when it &apos;s new .
__bs__ And it &apos;s the fastest thing on European waters .
__bs__ From 1994 , for seven years , 20 of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic , from Montenegro to Italy , every single night .
__bs__ And as a consequence of this trade , Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue .
__bs__ And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals .
__bs__ Now Italian police , when this trade started , had just two boats which could go at the same speed .
__bs__ And this is very important , because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas .
__bs__ Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution , and if the police intervened , they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning , rather than chasing the bad guys .
__bs__ So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys .
__bs__ And the answer is six vessels .
__bs__ And remember , 20 of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night .
__bs__ So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ?
__bs__ Well , this is where we come to globalization , because that was not just the deregulation of global trade .
__bs__ It was the liberalization of international financial markets .
__bs__ And boy , did that make it easy for the money launderers .
__bs__ The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre .
__bs__ In the 1990s , we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business , and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering .
__bs__ And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked .
__bs__ But at the heart of this , is the offshore banking network .
__bs__ Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade , and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime , money laundering , you have to get rid of them .
__bs__ On a positive note , we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities .
__bs__ And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation , regulation , effective regulation , I say , let &apos;s take a look at Bernie Madoff , who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail .
__bs__ Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars .
__bs__ That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates , but he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street , and no regulator picked up on it .
__bs__ So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street or in the city of London , fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering ?
__bs__ Well I can tell you , it &apos;s quite a few of them .
__bs__ Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now .
__bs__ And that is narcotics . Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning .
__bs__ This one , however , is in central British Columbia where I photographed it .
__bs__ It &apos;s one of the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.
__bs__ which ensure that over five percent of the province &apos;s GDP is accounted for by this trade .
__bs__ Now , I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera , of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it , of course , down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C. Bud , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s marketed as organic , which of course goes down very well in California .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , even by the police &apos;s admission , this makes not a dent in the profits , really , of the major exporters .
__bs__ Since the beginning of globalization , the global narcotics market has expanded enormously .
__bs__ There has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces .
__bs__ This , however , may all be about to change , because something very strange is going on .
__bs__ The United Nations recognized earlier this — it was last month actually — that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs .
__bs__ Interestingly , the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down , because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs .
__bs__ Now that is a game changer , because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world .
__bs__ When that happens , it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West .
__bs__ The drugs policy which we &apos;ve had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink , in my opinion .
__bs__ Now , the recession .
__bs__ Well , organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession .
__bs__ Not surprising , the most opportunistic industry in the whole world .
__bs__ And it has no rules to its regulatory system .
__bs__ Except , of course , it has two business risks : arrest by law enforcement , which is , frankly , the least of their worries , and competition from other groups , i.e. a bullet in the back of the head .
__bs__ What they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve shifted their operations .
__bs__ People don &apos;t smoke as much dope , or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession .
__bs__ And so instead , they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way , but above all , two sectors , and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime .
__bs__ And it &apos;s been terribly successful .
__bs__ I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle .
__bs__ Or perhaps I should say , more accurately , Señor Pringle .
__bs__ I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal .
__bs__ We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in São Paulo , together .
__bs__ Hooked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank .
__bs__ It &apos;s really not that difficult .
__bs__ And it &apos;s actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it &apos;s not so much the technology .
__bs__ The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering .
__bs__ Or to use the technical term for it , there &apos;s one born every minute .
__bs__ You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest .
__bs__ And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this , of course , the quickest way to a person &apos;s wallet is through the promise of sex and love .
__bs__ I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus , one of the very great worldwide viruses that came .
__bs__ I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out , because the first person I received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine .
__bs__ Now , she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time , but love was not amongst them .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox , I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection .
__bs__ So , cybercrime , do watch out for it .
__bs__ One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing is the Internet is assisting these guys .
__bs__ These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense .
__bs__ Now , Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection .
__bs__ But over the past year or so , researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what &apos;s happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance .
__bs__ And they fear that the reason why it &apos;s developing a resistance is because Cambodians can &apos;t afford the drugs on the commercial market , and so they buy it from the Internet .
__bs__ And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient .
__bs__ Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance .
__bs__ The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives .
__bs__ You don &apos;t have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime .
__bs__ They affect our bank accounts .
__bs__ They affect our communications , our pension funds .
__bs__ They even affect the food that we eat and our governments .
__bs__ This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York .
__bs__ There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century .
__bs__ This is a mighty industry , and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes .
__bs__ It is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously .
__bs__ It &apos;s been a privilege talking to you .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ And you don &apos;t have sex .
__bs__ &#91; And &#93; then a Plank in Reason , broke , and I fell down and down — and hit a World , at every plunge , and Finished knowing — then — &quot; &quot; We know depression through metaphors .
__bs__ Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language , Goya in an image .
__bs__ In 1991 , I had a series of losses .
__bs__ You know it &apos;s ridiculous while you &apos;re experiencing it .
__bs__ And then the anxiety set in .
__bs__ The next day I started with the medications and the therapy .
__bs__ And the other was that I had access to good treatment .
__bs__ Depression is the flaw in love .
__bs__ What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive ?
__bs__ But the truth lies .
__bs__ I became obsessed with that sentence : &quot; But the truth lies . &quot;
__bs__ And then she said , &quot; &quot; You know , my husband would never understand this .
__bs__ Depression is so exhausting .
__bs__ I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM .
__bs__ They didn &apos;t include drumming or music to get people &apos;s blood going .
__bs__ He was constantly depressed .
__bs__ Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week .
__bs__ Then he would feel okay for a week .
__bs__ Then he would have a week of going downhill .
__bs__ And he had the cingulotomy , and it was incredibly successful .
__bs__ He &apos;s now a friend of mine .
__bs__ I &apos;m alive and grateful .
__bs__ One of them , Lolly , came in , and this is what she said the day she came in .
__bs__ My husband has been telling me I &apos;m stupid , I &apos;m ugly .
__bs__ Those are the things that I feel sad about now .
__bs__ And I said to myself , well , what is the conclusion ?
__bs__ How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through ?
__bs__ To most of you , this is a device to buy , sell , play games , watch videos .
__bs__ I think it might be a lifeline .
__bs__ I think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin .
__bs__ I can help you with those later .
__bs__ But the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids .
__bs__ It might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
__bs__ Texting has a 100 percent open rate .
__bs__ We &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
__bs__ We &apos;ve been getting text messages back like these .
__bs__ He told me not to tell anyone .
__bs__ And yeah , we &apos;re there .
__bs__ I will not forget the day we got that text message .
__bs__ And so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline .
__bs__ Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
__bs__ Kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there &apos;s nowhere else to turn that they &apos;re sending them to us .
__bs__ So think about it , a text hotline ; it &apos;s pretty powerful .
__bs__ No one hears you in a stall , you &apos;re just texting quietly .
__bs__ It &apos;s real time .
__bs__ We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
__bs__ But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
__bs__ I want to prevent this shit from happening .
__bs__ There &apos;s something in New York City .
__bs__ And they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
__bs__ There is no census on bullying and dating abuse and eating disorders and cutting and rape — no census .
__bs__ Or maybe there &apos;s some anecdotal evidence .
__bs__ Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
__bs__ You could inform legislation .
__bs__ You could inform school policy .
__bs__ You could say to a principal , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re having a problem every Thursday at three o &apos;clock .
__bs__ Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
__bs__ I &apos;ve always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit .
__bs__ And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 27 .
__bs__ That &apos;s when I started writing songs , and even then I only played them for myself .
__bs__ Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
__bs__ But after a couple of years , just writing songs wasn &apos;t enough .
__bs__ I had all these stories and ideas , and I wanted to share them with people , but physiologically , I couldn &apos;t do it .
__bs__ I had this irrational fear .
__bs__ So on the week of my 30th birthday , I decided I was going to go to this local open mic , and put this fear behind me .
__bs__ Well , when I got there , it was packed .
__bs__ There were like 20 people there .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And they all looked angry .
__bs__ But I took a deep breath , and I signed up to play , and I felt pretty good .
__bs__ Pretty good , until about 10 minutes before my turn , when my whole body rebelled , and this wave of anxiety just washed over me .
__bs__ Now , when you experience fear , your sympathetic nervous system kicks in .
__bs__ So you have a rush of adrenaline , your heart rate increases , your breathing gets faster .
__bs__ Next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion . ( Laughter ) So your mouth gets dry , and blood is routed away from your extremities , so your fingers don &apos;t work anymore .
__bs__ Your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your Spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy . ( Laughter ) That condition is not conducive to performing folk music . ( Laughter )
__bs__ I mean , your nervous system is an idiot .
__bs__ Really ? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution , and it still can &apos;t tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) I have never been more terrified — until now .
__bs__ And this is not the good kind of vibrato , like an opera singer has , this is my whole body just convulsing with fear .
__bs__ I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
__bs__ I &apos;m embarrassed , the audience is clearly uncomfortable , they &apos;re focused on my discomfort .
__bs__ It was so bad .
__bs__ But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
__bs__ And something good did happen — I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for .
__bs__ And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this nervousness .
__bs__ That night I promised myself : I would go back every week until I wasn &apos;t nervous anymore .
__bs__ And that &apos;s when I had an epiphany .
__bs__ So I started writing a song about having stage fright .
__bs__ And then accounting for things like my shaky voice , and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal , because I was nervous .
__bs__ And eventually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to play the stage fright song at all .
__bs__ Except for when I was really nervous , like now . ( Laughter ) Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you ?
__bs__ ( Applause ) Can I have a sip of water ?
__bs__ ( Music ) Thank you .
__bs__ ♫ I &apos;m not joking , you know , ♫ ♫ this stage fright is real . ♫ ♫ And if I &apos;m up here trembling and singing , ♫ ♫ well , you &apos;ll know how I feel . ♫ ♫ And the mistake I &apos;d be making , ♫ ♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking . ♫ ♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me , ♫ ♫ well , you don &apos;t have to be . ♫ ♫ Well , maybe just a little bit . ♫ ( Laughter ) ♫ And maybe I &apos;ll try to imagine you all without clothes . ♫ ♫ But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows . ♫
__bs__ ♫ Not to discuss this at length , ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength . ♫ ♫ So frankly , I wish that you all would get dressed , ♫ ♫ I mean , you &apos;re not even really naked . ♫ ♫ And I &apos;m the one with the problem . ♫ ♫ And you tell me , don &apos;t worry so much , you &apos;ll be great . ♫ ♫ But I &apos;m the one living with me ♫ ♫ and I know how I get . ♫ ♫ Your advice is gentle but late . ♫ ♫ If not just a bit patronizing . ♫ ♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn &apos;t help me when I sing . ♫

__bs__ Why does the universe exist ?
__bs__ Why is there — Okay . Okay . ( Laughter ) This is a cosmic mystery . Be solemn .
__bs__ Why is there a world , why are we in it , and why is there something rather than nothing at all ?
__bs__ I mean , this is the super ultimate &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; question ?
__bs__ So I &apos;m going to talk about the mystery of existence , the puzzle of existence , where we are now in addressing it , and why you should care , and I hope you do care .
__bs__ The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that those who don &apos;t wonder about the contingency of their existence , of the contingency of the world &apos;s existence , are mentally deficient .
__bs__ That &apos;s a little harsh , but still . ( Laughter ) So this has been called the most sublime and awesome mystery , the deepest and most far-reaching question man can pose .
__bs__ It &apos;s obsessed great thinkers .
__bs__ Ludwig Wittgenstein , perhaps the greatest philosopher of the 20th century , was astonished that there should be a world at all .
__bs__ He wrote in his &quot; &quot; Tractatus , &quot; &quot; Proposition 4.66 , &quot; &quot; It is not how things are in the world that is the mystical , it &apos;s that the world exists . &quot; &quot; And if you don &apos;t like taking your epigrams from a philosopher , try a scientist .
__bs__ John Archibald Wheeler , one of the great physicists of the 20th century , the teacher of Richard Feynman , the coiner of the term &quot; &quot; black hole , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I want to know how come the quantum , how come the universe , how come existence ? &quot; &quot; And my friend Martin Amis — sorry that I &apos;ll be doing a lot of name-dropping in this talk , so get used to it — my dear friend Martin Amis once said that we &apos;re about five Einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from .
__bs__ And I &apos;ve no doubt there are five Einsteins in the audience tonight .
__bs__ Any Einsteins ? Show of hands ? No ? No ? No ?
__bs__ No Einsteins ? Okay .
__bs__ So this question , why is there something rather than nothing , this sublime question , was posed rather late in intellectual history .
__bs__ It was towards the end of the 17th century , the philosopher Leibniz who asked it , a very smart guy , Leibniz , who invented the calculus independently of Isaac Newton , at about the same time , but for Leibniz , who asked why is there something rather than nothing , this was not a great mystery .
__bs__ He either was or pretended to be an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook , and he said it &apos;s obvious why the world exists : because God created it .
__bs__ And God created , indeed , out of nothing at all .
__bs__ That &apos;s how powerful God is .
__bs__ He doesn &apos;t need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of .
__bs__ He can make it out of sheer nothingness , creation ex nihilo .
__bs__ And by the way , this is what most Americans today believe .
__bs__ There is no mystery of existence for them .
__bs__ God made it .
__bs__ So let &apos;s put this in an equation .
__bs__ I don &apos;t have any slides so I &apos;m going to mime my visuals , so use your imaginations .
__bs__ So it &apos;s God + nothing = the world .
__bs__ Okay ? Now that &apos;s the equation .
__bs__ And so maybe you don &apos;t believe in God .
__bs__ Maybe you &apos;re a scientific atheist or an unscientific atheist , and you don &apos;t believe in God , and you &apos;re not happy with it .
__bs__ By the way , even if we have this equation , God + nothing = the world , there &apos;s already a problem : Why does God exist ?
__bs__ God doesn &apos;t exist by logic alone unless you believe the ontological argument , and I hope you don &apos;t , because it &apos;s not a good argument .
__bs__ So it &apos;s conceivable , if God were to exist , he might wonder , I &apos;m eternal , I &apos;m all-powerful , but where did I come from ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Whence then am I ?
__bs__ God speaks in a more formal English .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And so one theory is that God was so bored with pondering the puzzle of His own existence that He created the world just to distract himself .
__bs__ But anyway , let &apos;s forget about God .
__bs__ Take God out of the equation : We have _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + nothing = the world .
__bs__ Now , if you &apos;re a Buddhist , you might want to stop right there , because essentially what you &apos;ve got is nothing = the world , and by symmetry of identity , that means the world = nothing . Okay ?
__bs__ And to a Buddhist , the world is just a whole lot of nothing .
__bs__ It &apos;s just a big cosmic vacuity .
__bs__ And we think there &apos;s a lot of something out there but that &apos;s because we &apos;re enslaved by our desires .
__bs__ If we let our desires melt away , we &apos;ll see the world for what it truly is , a vacuity , nothingness , and we &apos;ll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead . ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s the Buddhist thinking .
__bs__ But I &apos;m a Westerner , and I &apos;m still concerned with the puzzle of existence , so I &apos;ve got _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + — this is going to get serious in a minute , so — _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + nothing = the world .
__bs__ What are we going to put in that blank ?
__bs__ Well , how about science ?
__bs__ Science is our best guide to the nature of reality , and the most fundamental science is physics .
__bs__ That tells us what naked reality really is , that reveals what I call TAUFOTU , the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe .
__bs__ So maybe physics can fill this blank , and indeed , since about the late 1960s or around 1970 , physicists have purported to give a purely scientific explanation of how a universe like ours could have popped into existence out of sheer nothingness , a quantum fluctuation out of the void .
__bs__ Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists , more recently Alex Vilenkin , and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine , Lawrence Krauss , who wrote a book called &quot; A Universe from Nothing , &quot; and Lawrence thinks that he &apos;s given — he &apos;s a militant atheist , by the way , so he &apos;s gotten God out of the picture .
__bs__ The laws of quantum field theory , the state-of-the-art physics , can show how out of sheer nothingness , no space , no time , no matter , nothing , a little nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence , and then , by the miracle of inflation , blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos we see around us .
__bs__ Okay , this is a really ingenious scenario .
__bs__ It &apos;s very speculative . It &apos;s fascinating .
__bs__ But I &apos;ve got a big problem with it , and the problem is this : It &apos;s a pseudo-religious point of view .
__bs__ Now , Lawrence thinks he &apos;s an atheist , but he &apos;s still in thrall to a religious worldview .
__bs__ He sees physical laws as being like divine commands .
__bs__ The laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux , &quot; &quot; Let there be light . &quot; &quot; The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss , that it &apos;s pregnant with being .
__bs__ They can call a world into existence out of nothing .
__bs__ But that &apos;s a very primitive view of what a physical law is , right ?
__bs__ We know that physical laws are actually generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities in the world .
__bs__ They don &apos;t exist outside the world .
__bs__ They don &apos;t have any ontic cloud of their own .
__bs__ They can &apos;t call a world into existence out of nothingness .
__bs__ That &apos;s a very primitive view of what a scientific law is .
__bs__ And if you don &apos;t believe me on this , listen to Stephen Hawking , who himself put forward a model of the cosmos that was self-contained , didn &apos;t require any outside cause , any creator , and after proposing this , Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled .
__bs__ He said , this model is just equations .
__bs__ What breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe ?
__bs__ He was puzzled by this , so equations themselves can &apos;t do the magic , can &apos;t resolve the puzzle of existence .
__bs__ And besides , even if the laws could do that , why this set of laws ?
__bs__ Why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth ?
__bs__ Why not a completely different set of laws ?
__bs__ There are many , many mathematically consistent sets of laws .
__bs__ Why not no laws at all ? Why not sheer nothingness ?
__bs__ So this is a problem , believe it or not , that reflective physicists really think a lot about , and at this point they tend to go metaphysical , say , well , maybe the set of laws that describes our universe , it &apos;s just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality , but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality , and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist , they &apos;re all out there .
__bs__ We just see a little tiny part of reality that &apos;s described by the laws of quantum field theory , but there are many , many other worlds , parts of reality that are described by vastly different theories that are different from ours in ways we can &apos;t imagine , that are inconceivably exotic .
__bs__ Steven Weinberg , the father of the standard model of particle physics , has actually flirted with this idea himself , that all possible realities actually exist .
__bs__ Also , a younger physicist , Max Tegmark , who believes that all mathematical structures exist , and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence , so we have this vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility .
__bs__ Now , in taking this metaphysical way out , these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to Plato .
__bs__ It &apos;s the principle of plenitude or fecundity , or the great chain of being , that reality is actually as full as possible .
__bs__ It &apos;s as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be .
__bs__ So we have these two extremes now .
__bs__ We have sheer nothingness on one side , and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme : the fullest possible reality , nothingness , the simplest possible reality .
__bs__ Now what &apos;s in between these two extremes ?
__bs__ There are all kinds of intermediate realities that include some things and leave out others .
__bs__ So one of these intermediate realities is , say , the most mathematically elegant reality , that leaves out the inelegant bits , the ugly asymmetries and so forth .
__bs__ Now , there are some physicists who will tell you that we &apos;re actually living in the most elegant reality .
__bs__ I think that Brian Greene is in the audience , and he has written a book called &quot; &quot; The Elegant Universe . &quot; &quot; He claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant .
__bs__ Don &apos;t believe him . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a pious hope , I wish it were true , but I think the other day he admitted to me it &apos;s really an ugly universe .
__bs__ It &apos;s stupidly constructed , it &apos;s got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles , and what the hell is dark energy ?
__bs__ It &apos;s a stick and bubble gum contraption .
__bs__ It &apos;s not an elegant universe . ( Laughter ) And then there &apos;s the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense .
__bs__ You should get solemn now , because a world in which sentient beings don &apos;t suffer needlessly , in which there aren &apos;t things like childhood cancer or the Holocaust .
__bs__ This is an ethical conception .
__bs__ Anyway , so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality , various special realities .
__bs__ Nothingness is special . It &apos;s the simplest .
__bs__ Then there &apos;s the most elegant possible reality .
__bs__ That &apos;s special .
__bs__ The fullest possible reality , that &apos;s special .
__bs__ But what are we leaving out here ?
__bs__ There &apos;s also just the crummy , generic realities that aren &apos;t special in any way , that are sort of random .
__bs__ They &apos;re infinitely removed from nothingness , but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness .
__bs__ They &apos;re a mixture of chaos and order , of mathematical elegance and ugliness .
__bs__ So I would describe these realities as an infinite , mediocre , incomplete mess , a generic reality , a kind of cosmic junk shot .
__bs__ And these realities , is there a deity in any of these realities ?
__bs__ Maybe , but the deity isn &apos;t perfect like the Judeo-Christian deity .
__bs__ The deity isn &apos;t all-good and all-powerful .
__bs__ It might be instead 100 percent malevolent but only 80 percent effective , which pretty much describes the world we see around us , I think . ( Laughter ) So I would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence is that the reality we exist in is one of these generic realities .
__bs__ Reality has to turn out some way .
__bs__ It can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between .
__bs__ So if it has some special feature , like being really elegant or really full or really simple , like nothingness , that would require an explanation .
__bs__ But if it &apos;s just one of these random , generic realities , there &apos;s no further explanation for it .
__bs__ And indeed , I would say that &apos;s the reality we live in .
__bs__ That &apos;s what science is telling us .
__bs__ At the beginning of the week , we got the exciting information that the theory of inflation , which predicts a big , infinite , messy , arbitrary , pointless reality , it &apos;s like a big frothing champagne coming out of a bottle endlessly , a vast universe , mostly a wasteland with little pockets of charm and order and peace , this has been confirmed , this inflationary scenario , by the observations made by radio telescopes in Antarctica that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves from just before the Big Bang .
__bs__ I &apos;m sure you all know about this .
__bs__ So anyway , I think there &apos;s some evidence that this really is the reality that we &apos;re stuck with .
__bs__ Now , why should you care ?
__bs__ Well — ( Laughter ) — the question , &quot; &quot; Why does the world exist ? &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the cosmic question , it sort of rhymes with a more intimate question : Why do I exist ? Why do you exist ?
__bs__ you know , our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable , because there &apos;s an enormous number of genetically possible humans , if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth , and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you there are about 10 to the 10,000th possible humans , genetically .
__bs__ That &apos;s between a googol and a googolplex .
__bs__ And the number of the actual humans that have existed is 100 billion , maybe 50 billion , an infinitesimal fraction , so all of us , we &apos;ve won this amazing cosmic lottery .
__bs__ We &apos;re here . Okay .
__bs__ So what kind of reality do we want to live in ?
__bs__ Do we want to live in a special reality ?
__bs__ What if we were living in the most elegant possible reality ?
__bs__ Imagine the existential pressure on us to live up to that , to be elegant , not to pull down the tone of it .
__bs__ Or , what if we were living in the fullest possible reality ?
__bs__ Well then our existence would be guaranteed , because every possible thing exists in that reality , but our choices would be meaningless .
__bs__ If I really struggle morally and agonize and I decide to do the right thing , what difference does it make , because there are an infinite number of versions of me also doing the right thing and an infinite number doing the wrong thing .
__bs__ So my choices are meaningless .
__bs__ So we don &apos;t want to live in that special reality .
__bs__ And as for the special reality of nothingness , we wouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
__bs__ So I think living in a generic reality that &apos;s mediocre , there are nasty bits and nice bits and we could make the nice bits bigger and the nasty bits smaller and that gives us a kind of purpose in life .
__bs__ The universe is absurd , but we can still construct a purpose , and that &apos;s a pretty good one , and the overall mediocrity of reality kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity we all feel in the core of our being .
__bs__ And I know you feel it .
__bs__ I know you &apos;re all special , but you &apos;re still kind of secretly mediocre , don &apos;t you think ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So anyway , you may say , this puzzle , the mystery of existence , it &apos;s just silly mystery-mongering .
__bs__ You &apos;re not astonished at the existence of the universe and you &apos;re in good company .
__bs__ Bertrand Russell said , &quot; I should say the universe is just there , and that &apos;s all . &quot;
__bs__ Just a brute fact .
__bs__ And my professor at Columbia , Sidney Morgenbesser , a great philosophical wag , when I said to him , &quot; &quot; Professor Morgenbesser , why is there something rather than nothing ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , even if there was nothing , you still wouldn &apos;t be satisfied . &quot; &quot; So — ( Laughter ) — okay .
__bs__ So you &apos;re not astonished . I don &apos;t care .
__bs__ But I will tell you something to conclude that I guarantee you will astonish you , because it &apos;s astonished all of the brilliant , wonderful people I &apos;ve met at this TED conference , when I &apos;ve told them , and it &apos;s this : Never in my life have I had a cell phone .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
__bs__ And we see , truly , in some Muslim communities , that tradition .
__bs__ The résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé , which are the skills you bring to the marketplace .
__bs__ The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy , which are deeper : who are you , in your depth , what is the nature of your relationships , are you bold , loving , dependable , consistency ?
__bs__ Adam I is the worldly , ambitious , external side of our nature .
__bs__ Adam II is the humble side of our nature .
__bs__ Adam II wants not only to do good but to be good , to live in a way internally that honors God , creation and our possibilities .
__bs__ Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world .
__bs__ Adam I savors accomplishment .
__bs__ Adam II savors inner consistency and strength .
__bs__ Adam I asks how things work .
__bs__ Adam II asks why we &apos;re here .
__bs__ We live in perpetual self-confrontation between the external success and the internal value .
__bs__ And the tricky thing , I &apos;d say , about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics .
__bs__ The external logic is an economic logic : input leads to output , risk leads to reward .
__bs__ The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and often an inverse logic .
__bs__ You have to give to receive .
__bs__ You have to surrender to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself .
__bs__ In order to fulfill yourself , you have to forget yourself .
__bs__ In order to find yourself , you have to lose yourself .
__bs__ We happen to live in a society that favors Adam I , and often neglects Adam II .
__bs__ You &apos;re not earning the sort of eulogy you want , you hope someone will give to you .
__bs__ You don &apos;t have the depth of conviction .
__bs__ You don &apos;t have an emotional sonorousness .
__bs__ You don &apos;t have commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit .
__bs__ Through history , people have gone back into their own pasts , sometimes to a precious time in their life , to their childhood , and often , the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame , some sin committed , some act of selfishness , an act of omission , of shallowness , the sin of anger , the sin of self-pity , trying to be a people-pleaser , a lack of courage .
__bs__ Adam I is built by building on your strengths .
__bs__ Adam II is built by fighting your weaknesses .
__bs__ And we &apos;re often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves , in that we &apos;re not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it , how to confront it , and how to combat it .
__bs__ We live in a culture with an Adam I mentality where we &apos;re inarticulate about Adam II .
__bs__ Finally , Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation , the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life , this way : &quot; &quot; Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime ; therefore we must be saved by hope .
__bs__ Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history ; therefore we must be saved by faith .
__bs__ Nothing we do , however virtuous , can be accomplished alone ; therefore we must be saved by love .
__bs__ Therefore we must be saved by that final form of love , which is forgiveness . ” Thanks .

__bs__ This is a photograph by the artist Michael Najjar , and it &apos;s real , in the sense that he went there to Argentina to take the photo .
__bs__ But it &apos;s also a fiction . There &apos;s a lot of work that went into it after that .
__bs__ And what he &apos;s done is he &apos;s actually reshaped , digitally , all of the contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index .
__bs__ So what you see , that precipice , that high precipice with the valley , is the 2008 financial crisis .
__bs__ The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there .
__bs__ I don &apos;t know where we are now .
__bs__ This is the Hang Seng index for Hong Kong .
__bs__ And similar topography .
__bs__ I wonder why .
__bs__ And this is art . This is metaphor .
__bs__ But I think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth , and it &apos;s with those teeth that I want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math — not just financial math , but math in general .
__bs__ That its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it — the world around us and the world inside us .
__bs__ And it &apos;s specifically algorithms , which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .
__bs__ They acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again , and they ossify and calcify , and they become real .
__bs__ And I was thinking about this , of all places , on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago , because I happened to be seated next to a Hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the Cold War for physicists in Hungary .
__bs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; So what were you doing ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well we were mostly breaking stealth . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good job . That &apos;s interesting .
__bs__ How does that work ? &quot; &quot; And to understand that , you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works .
__bs__ And so — this is an over-simplification — but basically , it &apos;s not like you can just pass a radar signal right through 156 tons of steel in the sky .
__bs__ It &apos;s not just going to disappear .
__bs__ But if you can take this big , massive thing , and you could turn it into a million little things — something like a flock of birds — well then the radar that &apos;s looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky .
__bs__ And if you &apos;re a radar , that &apos;s a really bad job .
__bs__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s if you &apos;re a radar .
__bs__ So we didn &apos;t use a radar ; we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals , electronic communication .
__bs__ And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication , we thought , &apos; Probably has something to do with the Americans . &apos; &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah .
__bs__ That &apos;s good .
__bs__ So you &apos;ve effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research .
__bs__ What &apos;s your act two ?
__bs__ What do you do when you grow up ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; Well , financial services . &quot;
__bs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh . &quot; &quot; Because those had been in the news lately .
__bs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; How does that work ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now , and I &apos;m one of them . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the black box for Wall Street ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s funny you ask that , because it &apos;s actually called black box trading .
__bs__ And it &apos;s also sometimes called algo trading , algorithmic trading . &quot; &quot; And algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the United States Air Force had , which is that they &apos;re moving these positions — whether it &apos;s Proctor &amp; Gamble or Accenture , whatever — they &apos;re moving a million shares of something through the market .
__bs__ And if they do that all at once , it &apos;s like playing poker and going all in right away .
__bs__ You just tip your hand .
__bs__ And so they have to find a way — and they use algorithms to do this — to break up that big thing into a million little transactions .
__bs__ And the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what &apos;s actually happening in the market .
__bs__ So if you need to have some image of what &apos;s happening in the stock market right now , what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide , and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act .
__bs__ And all of that &apos;s great , and it &apos;s fine .
__bs__ And that &apos;s 70 percent of the United States stock market , 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension , your mortgage .
__bs__ And what could go wrong ?
__bs__ What could go wrong is that a year ago , nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes , and they called it the Flash Crash of 2 : 45 .
__bs__ All of a sudden , nine percent just goes away , and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it , nobody asked for it .
__bs__ Nobody had any control over what was actually happening .
__bs__ All they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said , &quot; &quot; Stop . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the thing , is that we &apos;re writing things , we &apos;re writing these things that we can no longer read .
__bs__ And we &apos;ve rendered something illegible , and we &apos;ve lost the sense of what &apos;s actually happening in this world that we &apos;ve made .
__bs__ And we &apos;re starting to make our way .
__bs__ There &apos;s a company in Boston called Nanex , and they use math and magic and I don &apos;t know what , and they reach into all the market data and they find , actually sometimes , some of these algorithms .
__bs__ And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .
__bs__ And they do what we &apos;ve always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don &apos;t understand — which is that they give them a name and a story .
__bs__ So this is one that they found , they called the Knife , the Carnival , the Boston Shuffler , Twilight .
__bs__ And the gag is that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market .
__bs__ You can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them .
__bs__ You can find it here : this book about flies that you may have been looking at on Amazon .
__bs__ You may have noticed it when its price started at 1.7 million dollars .
__bs__ It &apos;s out of print — still ...
__bs__ ( Laughter ) If you had bought it at 1.7 , it would have been a bargain .
__bs__ A few hours later , it had gone up to 23.6 million dollars , plus shipping and handling .
__bs__ And the question is : Nobody was buying or selling anything ; what was happening ?
__bs__ And you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street .
__bs__ And when you see this kind of behavior , what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict , algorithms locked in loops with each other , without any human oversight , without any adult supervision to say , &quot; &quot; Actually , 1.7 million is plenty . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And as with Amazon , so it is with Netflix .
__bs__ And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years .
__bs__ They started with Cinematch , and they &apos;ve tried a bunch of others — there &apos;s Dinosaur Planet ; there &apos;s Gravity .
__bs__ They &apos;re using Pragmatic Chaos now .
__bs__ Pragmatic Chaos is , like all of Netflix algorithms , trying to do the same thing .
__bs__ It &apos;s trying to get a grasp on you , on the firmware inside the human skull , so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next — which is a very , very difficult problem .
__bs__ But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don &apos;t really quite have it down , it doesn &apos;t take away from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has .
__bs__ Pragmatic Chaos , like all Netflix algorithms , determines , in the end , 60 percent of what movies end up being rented .
__bs__ So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies .
__bs__ But what if you could rate those movies before they get made ?
__bs__ Wouldn &apos;t that be handy ?
__bs__ Well , a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood , and they have &quot; &quot; story algorithms &quot; &quot; — a company called Epagogix .
__bs__ And you can run your script through there , and they can tell you , quantifiably , that that &apos;s a 30 million dollar movie or a 200 million dollar movie .
__bs__ And the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t Google .
__bs__ This isn &apos;t information .
__bs__ These aren &apos;t financial stats ; this is culture .
__bs__ And what you see here , or what you don &apos;t really see normally , is that these are the physics of culture .
__bs__ And if these algorithms , like the algorithms on Wall Street , just crashed one day and went awry , how would we know ?
__bs__ What would it look like ?
__bs__ And they &apos;re in your house . They &apos;re in your house .
__bs__ These are two algorithms competing for your living room .
__bs__ These are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means .
__bs__ And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them , and they &apos;re sort of like secret architects in your bedroom .
__bs__ And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far-fetched .
__bs__ It &apos;s super-real and it &apos;s happening around you .
__bs__ You feel it most when you &apos;re in a sealed metal box , a new-style elevator ; they &apos;re called destination-control elevators .
__bs__ These are the ones where you have to press what floor you &apos;re going to go to before you get in the elevator .
__bs__ And it uses what &apos;s called a bin-packing algorithm .
__bs__ So none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want .
__bs__ Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two , and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five .
__bs__ And the problem with that is that people freak out .
__bs__ People panic .
__bs__ And you see why . You see why .
__bs__ It &apos;s because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation , like the buttons .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Like the things that people use .
__bs__ All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says , &quot; &quot; Stop . &quot; &quot; And this is what we &apos;re designing for .
__bs__ We &apos;re designing for this machine dialect .
__bs__ And how far can you take that ? How far can you take it ?
__bs__ You can take it really , really far .
__bs__ So let me take it back to Wall Street .
__bs__ Because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else , which is speed .
__bs__ And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds .
__bs__ And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are , it takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse .
__bs__ But if you &apos;re a Wall Street algorithm and you &apos;re five microseconds behind , you &apos;re a loser .
__bs__ So if you were an algorithm , you &apos;d look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper — throwing out all the furniture , all the infrastructure for human use , and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in — all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet .
__bs__ And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system .
__bs__ And of course , it is , but it &apos;s distributed from places .
__bs__ In New York , this is where it &apos;s distributed from : the Carrier Hotel located on Hudson Street .
__bs__ And this is really where the wires come right up into the city .
__bs__ And the reality is that the further away you are from that , you &apos;re a few microseconds behind every time .
__bs__ These guys down on Wall Street , Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation , they &apos;re eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel .
__bs__ And that &apos;s going to keep happening .
__bs__ We &apos;re going to keep hollowing them out , because you , inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar , none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the Boston Shuffler could .
__bs__ But if you zoom out , if you zoom out , you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago that &apos;s been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks .
__bs__ This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse — just for these algorithms , just for the Carnival and the Knife .
__bs__ And when you think about this , that we &apos;re running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster , all for a communications framework that no human will ever know , that &apos;s a kind of manifest destiny ; and we &apos;ll always look for a new frontier .
__bs__ Unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
__bs__ This is just theoretical .
__bs__ This is some mathematicians at MIT .
__bs__ And the truth is I don &apos;t really understand a lot of what they &apos;re talking about .
__bs__ It involves light cones and quantum entanglement , and I don &apos;t really understand any of that .
__bs__ But I can read this map , and what this map says is that , if you &apos;re trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are , that &apos;s where people are , where the cities are , you &apos;re going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively .
__bs__ And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean .
__bs__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do : we &apos;ll build bubbles or something , or platforms .
__bs__ We &apos;ll actually part the water to pull money out of the air , because it &apos;s a bright future if you &apos;re an algorithm .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting actually .
__bs__ It &apos;s what the money motivates , that we &apos;re actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency .
__bs__ And in that light , you go back and you look at Michael Najjar &apos;s photographs , and you realize that they &apos;re not metaphor , they &apos;re prophecy .
__bs__ They &apos;re prophecy for the kind of seismic , terrestrial effects of the math that we &apos;re making .
__bs__ And the landscape was always made by this sort of weird , uneasy collaboration between nature and man .
__bs__ But now there &apos;s this third co-evolutionary force : algorithms — the Boston Shuffler , the Carnival .
__bs__ And we will have to understand those as nature , and in a way , they are .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ And that is that all of us want to be happy .
__bs__ In this , we are all together .
__bs__ How we imagine our happiness , that differs from one another , but it &apos;s already a lot that we have all in common , that we want to be happy .
__bs__ Now my topic is gratefulness .
__bs__ Many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy .
__bs__ When you are happy , you are grateful .
__bs__ But think again .
__bs__ And we all know people who have lots of misfortune , misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have , and they are deeply happy .
__bs__ They radiate happiness . You are surprised .
__bs__ Why ? Because they are grateful .
__bs__ So it is not happiness that makes us grateful .
__bs__ It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
__bs__ Now , we can ask , what do we really mean by gratefulness ?
__bs__ I appeal to your own experience .
__bs__ We all know from experience how it goes .
__bs__ We experience something that &apos;s valuable to us .
__bs__ And it &apos;s really given .
__bs__ These two things have to come together .
__bs__ It has to be something valuable , and it &apos;s a real gift .
__bs__ And when these two things come together , something that &apos;s really valuable to me and I realize it &apos;s freely given , then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart , happiness spontaneously rises in my heart .
__bs__ That &apos;s how gratefulness happens .
__bs__ We cannot only have grateful experiences .
__bs__ We can be people who live gratefully .
__bs__ Grateful living , that is the thing .
__bs__ It &apos;s a gift . You haven &apos;t earned it .
__bs__ You haven &apos;t brought it about in any way .
__bs__ If we didn &apos;t have this present moment , we wouldn &apos;t have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
__bs__ Now , we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity .
__bs__ Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands .
__bs__ Moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift .
__bs__ Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
__bs__ Certainly not .
__bs__ It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
__bs__ Learning patience , for instance .
__bs__ We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint , but is more like a marathon .
__bs__ That takes patience . That &apos;s difficult .
__bs__ It may be to stand up for your opinion , to stand up for your conviction .
__bs__ That &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
__bs__ They make something out of life .
__bs__ That &apos;s the wonderful richness of life .
__bs__ So how can we find a method that will harness this ?
__bs__ Stop .
__bs__ We rush through life . We don &apos;t stop .
__bs__ We miss the opportunity because we don &apos;t stop .
__bs__ We have to stop .
__bs__ In Africa where I was , I didn &apos;t have drinkable water .
__bs__ Every time I turned on the faucet , I was overwhelmed .
__bs__ Every time I clicked on the light , I was so grateful .
__bs__ But after a while , this wears off .
__bs__ So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet , and every time I turned it on , water .
__bs__ So leave it up to your own imagination .
__bs__ You open your ears . You open your nose .
__bs__ Stop , look , and then go , and really do something .
__bs__ Mostly it &apos;s the opportunity to enjoy , but sometimes it &apos;s something more difficult .
__bs__ The future of the world will be a network , not a pyramid turned upside down .
__bs__ A grateful world is a world of joyful people .
__bs__ We have a network for grateful living , and it has mushroomed .
__bs__ We couldn &apos;t understand why it mushroomed .
__bs__ We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ So as a fashion designer , I &apos;ve always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
__bs__ But then I met a biologist , and now I think of materials like this — green tea , sugar , a few microbes and a little time .
__bs__ I &apos;m essentially using a kombucha recipe , which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria , yeasts and other micro-organisms , which spin cellulose in a fermentation process .
__bs__ Over time , these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface .
__bs__ So we start by brewing the tea .
__bs__ I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time , and then while it &apos;s still hot , add a couple of kilos of sugar .
__bs__ We stir this in until it &apos;s completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .
__bs__ We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
__bs__ And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
__bs__ And along with that , some acetic acid .
__bs__ And once you get this process going , you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid .
__bs__ We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
__bs__ And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it .
__bs__ And actually , in hot weather , I can just grow it outside .
__bs__ So this is my mini fabric farm .
__bs__ After about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
__bs__ So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing .
__bs__ And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid .
__bs__ So they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
__bs__ And they &apos;re sticking together , forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface .
__bs__ After about two to three weeks , we &apos;re looking at something which is about an inch in thickness .
__bs__ So the bath on the left is after five days , and on the right , after 10 .
__bs__ And this is a static culture .
__bs__ You don &apos;t have to do anything to it ; you just literally watch it grow .
__bs__ It doesn &apos;t need light .
__bs__ And when it &apos;s ready to harvest , you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold , soapy water .
__bs__ At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
__bs__ It &apos;s over 90 percent water , so we need to let that evaporate .
__bs__ So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
__bs__ Again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
__bs__ And as it &apos;s drying , it &apos;s compressing , so what you &apos;re left with , depending on the recipe , is something that &apos;s either like a really light-weight , transparent paper , or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather .
__bs__ And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally , or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape .
__bs__ And as it evaporates , it will knit itself together , forming seams .
__bs__ So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea .
__bs__ I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which intrigues me .
__bs__ Since it &apos;s organic , I &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
__bs__ I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation .
__bs__ Using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning .
__bs__ And using indigo , make it anti-microbial .
__bs__ And in fact , cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark .
__bs__ And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose , it just takes one , and a really short one at that .
__bs__ What I can &apos;t yet do is make it water-resistant .
__bs__ So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today , I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water .
__bs__ The dress would get really heavy , and eventually the seams would probably fall apart — leaving me feeling rather naked .
__bs__ Possibly a good performance piece , but definitely not ideal for everyday wear .
__bs__ What I &apos;m looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need .
__bs__ So what I want to do is say to a future bug , &quot; &quot; Spin me a thread .
__bs__ Align it in this direction .
__bs__ Make it hydrophobic .
__bs__ And while you &apos;re at it , just form it around this 3D shape . &quot; &quot; Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing , and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels , possibly even replacement bone tissue .
__bs__ But with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire .
__bs__ Obviously , as a designer , that &apos;s really exciting because then I start to think , wow , we could actually imagine growing consumable products .
__bs__ What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency .
__bs__ So we only grow what we need .
__bs__ There &apos;s no waste .
__bs__ And in fact , we could make it from a waste stream — so for example , a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant .
__bs__ Finally , at the end of use , we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings .
__bs__ What I &apos;m not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
__bs__ But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .
__bs__ Ultimately , maybe it won &apos;t even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact .
__bs__ We could , for example , imagine growing a lamp , a chair , a car or maybe even a house .
__bs__ So I guess what my question to you is : in the future , what would you choose to grow ?
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Suzanne , just a curiosity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random . ( Suzanne Lee : No . ) This is one of the jackets you grew ?
__bs__ SL : Yes , it is .
__bs__ It &apos;s probably — part of the project &apos;s still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s absorbing my sweat , and it &apos;s feeding on it .
__bs__ BG : Okay , so we &apos;ll let you go and save it , and rescue it .
__bs__ Suzanne Lee . ( SL : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__bs__ I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs , but not the cyborgs that you think .
__bs__ You &apos;re not RoboCop , and you &apos;re not Terminator , but you &apos;re cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices .
__bs__ So what &apos;s a good definition for cyborg ?
__bs__ Well , traditional definition is &quot; &quot; an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments . &quot; &quot; That came from a 1960 paper on space travel , because , if you think about it , space is pretty awkward .
__bs__ People aren &apos;t supposed to be there .
__bs__ But humans are curious , and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next .
__bs__ So let &apos;s look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
__bs__ Somebody goes to another country , says , &quot; &quot; How fascinating these people are , how interesting their tools are , how curious their culture is . &quot; &quot; And then they write a paper , and maybe a few other anthropologists read it , and we think it &apos;s very exotic .
__bs__ Well , what &apos;s happening is that we &apos;ve suddenly found a new species .
__bs__ I , as a cyborg anthropologist , have suddenly said , &quot; &quot; Oh , wow . Now suddenly we &apos;re a new form of Homo sapiens , and look at these fascinating cultures , and look at these curious rituals that everybody &apos;s doing around this technology .
__bs__ They &apos;re clicking on things and staring at screens . &quot; &quot; Now there &apos;s a reason why I study this , versus traditional anthropology .
__bs__ And the reason is that tool use , in the beginning — for thousands and thousands of years , everything has been a physical modification of self .
__bs__ It has helped us to extend our physical selves , go faster , hit things harder , and there &apos;s been a limit on that .
__bs__ But now what we &apos;re looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
__bs__ And the other thing that happens is that we &apos;re all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology .
__bs__ We can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get heavier , and then we can take anything out .
__bs__ What does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
__bs__ Well , if you print it out , it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you &apos;re carrying around all the time .
__bs__ And if you actually lose that information , it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind , that you suddenly feel like something &apos;s missing , except you aren &apos;t able to see it , so it feels like a very strange emotion .
__bs__ The other thing that happens is that you have a second self .
__bs__ Whether you like it or not , you &apos;re starting to show up online , and people are interacting with your second self when you &apos;re not there .
__bs__ And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open , which is basically your Facebook wall , so that people don &apos;t write on it in the middle of the night — because it &apos;s very much the equivalent .
__bs__ And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
__bs__ You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life .
__bs__ So , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
__bs__ And the problem is that a lot of people now , especially adolescents , have to go through two adolescences .
__bs__ They have to go through their primary one , that &apos;s already awkward , and then they go through their second self &apos;s adolescence , and that &apos;s even more awkward because there &apos;s an actual history of what they &apos;ve gone through online .
__bs__ And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now , and so it &apos;s very awkward , and it &apos;s very difficult for them to do those things .
__bs__ So when I was little , my dad would sit me down at night and he would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to teach you about time and space in the future . &quot;
__bs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Great . &quot; &quot; And he said one day , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the shortest distance between two points ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a straight line . You told me that yesterday . &quot; &quot; I thought I was very clever .
__bs__ He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . Here &apos;s a better way . &quot; &quot; He took a piece of paper , drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched .
__bs__ And he said , &quot; &quot; That is the shortest distance between two points . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you just bend time and space , it takes an awful lot of energy , and that &apos;s just how you do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , okay . &quot; &quot; And so , when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years , I was thinking at night , &quot; &quot; I want to be the first person to create a wormhole , to make things accelerate faster .
__bs__ And I want to make a time machine . &quot; &quot; I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders .
__bs__ But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn &apos;t just get adopted because it works .
__bs__ It gets adopted because people use it and it &apos;s made for humans .
__bs__ So I started studying anthropology .
__bs__ And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones , I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets .
__bs__ They weren &apos;t physically transporting themselves ; they were mentally transporting themselves .
__bs__ They would click on a button , and they would be connected as A to B immediately .
__bs__ And I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , wow . I found it . This is great . &quot; &quot; So over time , time and space have compressed because of this .
__bs__ You can stand on one side of the world , whisper something and be heard on the other .
__bs__ One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use .
__bs__ Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time .
__bs__ And because of that , you start to dig around for your external memories — where did you leave them ?
__bs__ So now we &apos;re all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we &apos;ve lost on our external brains that we &apos;re carrying around in our pockets .
__bs__ And that incites a sort of panic architecture — &quot; Oh no , where &apos;s this thing ? &quot;
__bs__ We &apos;re all &quot; &quot; I Love Lucy &quot; &quot; on a great assembly line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
__bs__ And so what happens is , when we bring all that into the social space , we end up checking our phones all the time .
__bs__ So we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
__bs__ It &apos;s not that we &apos;re always connected to everybody , but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want .
__bs__ And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone , the room would be very crowded .
__bs__ These are the people that you have access to right now , in general — all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
__bs__ And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
__bs__ One I &apos;m really worried about is that people aren &apos;t taking time for mental reflection anymore , and that they aren &apos;t slowing down and stopping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces , paleontology and panic architecture .
__bs__ They &apos;re not just sitting there .
__bs__ And really , when you have no external input , that is a time when there is a creation of self , when you can do long-term planning , when you can try and figure out who you really are .
__bs__ And then , once you do that , you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way , instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in — and oh , I have to do this , and I have to do this , and I have to do this .
__bs__ And so this is very important .
__bs__ I &apos;m really worried that , especially kids today , they &apos;re not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
__bs__ So if you think about it , the world hasn &apos;t stopped either .
__bs__ It has its own external prosthetic devices , and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other .
__bs__ But when you actually visualize it , all the connections that we &apos;re doing right now — this is an image of the mapping of the Internet — it doesn &apos;t look technological .
__bs__ It actually looks very organic .
__bs__ This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we &apos;ve connected in this way .
__bs__ And it &apos;s not that machines are taking over .
__bs__ It &apos;s that they &apos;re helping us to be more human , helping us to connect with each other .
__bs__ The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives .
__bs__ And really , it ends up being more human than technology , because we &apos;re co-creating each other all the time .
__bs__ And so this is the important point that I like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connection — it &apos;s just done in a different way .
__bs__ We &apos;re just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other , regardless of geography .
__bs__ So that &apos;s why I study cyborg anthropology .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us .
__bs__ This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality , increasingly grim reality , and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology , and that &apos;s very understandable .
__bs__ Now , this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population , rising towards 10 billion people , land that is turning to desert , and , of course , climate change .
__bs__ Now there &apos;s no question about it at all : we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology .
__bs__ But fossil fuels , carbon — coal and gas — are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change .
__bs__ Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
__bs__ There &apos;s no other cause .
__bs__ And I intend to focus on most of the world &apos;s land that is turning to desert .
__bs__ But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine .
__bs__ We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year .
__bs__ On those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground .
__bs__ No matter what you do , nature covers it up so quickly .
__bs__ And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness , and that is where desertification is occurring .
__bs__ Fortunately , with space technology now , we can look at it from space , and when we do , you can see the proportions fairly well .
__bs__ Generally , what you see in green is not desertifying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth .
__bs__ About two thirds , I would guess , of the world is desertifying .
__bs__ I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters — that &apos;s an inch of rain — was falling .
__bs__ Think of it in terms of drums of water , each containing 200 liters .
__bs__ Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day .
__bs__ The next day , the land looked like this .
__bs__ Where had that water gone ?
__bs__ Some of it ran off as flooding , but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again , exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered .
__bs__ Now , because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter , when we damage soils , you give off carbon .
__bs__ Carbon goes back to the atmosphere .
__bs__ Now you &apos;re told over and over , repeatedly , that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world , and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence .
__bs__ But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them , you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you &apos;ve just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae , leading to increased runoff and evaporation .
__bs__ That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form .
__bs__ Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock , mostly cattle , sheep and goats , overgrazing the plants , leaving the soil bare and giving off methane .
__bs__ Almost everybody knows this , from nobel laureates to golf caddies , or was taught it , as I was .
__bs__ Now , the environments like you see here , dusty environments in Africa where I grew up , and I loved wildlife , and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing .
__bs__ And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs .
__bs__ Well , I have news for you .
__bs__ We were once just as certain that the world was flat .
__bs__ We were wrong then , and we are wrong again .
__bs__ And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery .
__bs__ When I was a young man , a young biologist in Africa , I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks .
__bs__ Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum-beating people to protect the animals , than the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed .
__bs__ Now , no livestock were involved , but suspecting that we had too many elephants now , I did the research and I proved we had too many , and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain .
__bs__ Now , that was a terrible decision for me to have to make , and it was political dynamite , frankly .
__bs__ So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research .
__bs__ They did . They agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage .
__bs__ And it got worse , not better .
__bs__ Loving elephants as I do , that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life , and I will carry that to my grave .
__bs__ One good thing did come out of it .
__bs__ It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions .
__bs__ When I came to the United States , I got a shock , to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa .
__bs__ And there &apos;d been no livestock on this land for over 70 years .
__bs__ And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural .
__bs__ So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification , but I found the opposite , as we see on this research station , where this grassland that was green in 1961 , by 2002 had changed to that situation .
__bs__ And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to &quot; &quot; unknown processes . &quot; &quot; Clearly , we have never understood what is causing desertification , which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally .
__bs__ We have never understood it .
__bs__ Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here , and I promise you , you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it &apos;s just covered with litter , plant litter .
__bs__ You have changed the microclimate .
__bs__ Now , by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world &apos;s land , you are changing macroclimate .
__bs__ But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago ?
__bs__ Why has it accelerated lately ?
__bs__ We had no understanding of that .
__bs__ What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world , the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals , and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators .
__bs__ Now , the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds , and the larger the herd , the safer the individuals .
__bs__ Now , large herds dung and urinate all over their own food , and they have to keep moving , and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants , while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil , as we see where a herd has passed .
__bs__ This picture is a typical seasonal grassland .
__bs__ It has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry season .
__bs__ And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season .
__bs__ Now , all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season , and if it doesn &apos;t , the grassland and the soil begin to die .
__bs__ Now , if it does not decay biologically , it shifts to oxidation , which is a very slow process , and this smothers and kills grasses , leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil , releasing carbon .
__bs__ To prevent that , we have traditionally used fire .
__bs__ But fire also leaves the soil bare , releasing carbon , and worse than that , burning one hectare of grassland gives off more , and more damaging , pollutants than 6,000 cars .
__bs__ And we are burning in Africa , every single year , more than one billion hectares of grasslands , and almost nobody is talking about it .
__bs__ We justify the burning , as scientists , because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow .
__bs__ Now , looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry , what could we do to keep that healthy ?
__bs__ And bear in mind , I &apos;m talking of most of the world &apos;s land now .
__bs__ Okay ? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change .
__bs__ We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change .
__bs__ What are we going to do ?
__bs__ There is only one option , I &apos;ll repeat to you , only one option left to climatologists and scientists , and that is to do the unthinkable , and to use livestock , bunched and moving , as a proxy for former herds and predators , and mimic nature .
__bs__ There is no other alternative left to mankind .
__bs__ So let &apos;s do that .
__bs__ So on this bit of grassland , we &apos;ll do it , but just in the foreground .
__bs__ We &apos;ll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature , and we &apos;ve done so , and look at that .
__bs__ All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung , urine and litter or mulch , as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand , and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain , to store carbon , and to break down methane .
__bs__ And we did that , without using fire to damage the soil , and the plants are free to grow .
__bs__ When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , I was faced with a real dilemma .
__bs__ How were we to do it ?
__bs__ We &apos;d had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals , but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world .
__bs__ Then we &apos;d had 100 years of modern rain science , and that had accelerated desertification , as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States , and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government .
__bs__ Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals , and humans , over thousands of years , had never been able to deal with nature &apos;s complexity .
__bs__ But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this .
__bs__ So rather than reinvent the wheel , I began studying other professions to see if anybody had .
__bs__ And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need , and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing , a planning process , and that does address all of nature &apos;s complexity and our social , environmental , economic complexity .
__bs__ Today , we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds , plan their grazing to mimic nature , and where we have them hold their animals overnight — we run them in a predator-friendly manner , because we have a lot of lands , and so on — and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields , we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well .
__bs__ Let &apos;s look at some results .
__bs__ This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe .
__bs__ It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year , and it &apos;s going into the long dry season .
__bs__ But as you can see , all of that rain , almost of all it , has evaporated from the soil surface .
__bs__ Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended , and we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid .
__bs__ Now let &apos;s go to our land nearby on the same day , with the same rainfall , and look at that .
__bs__ Our river is flowing and healthy and clean .
__bs__ It &apos;s fine .
__bs__ The production of grass , shrubs , trees , wildlife , everything is now more productive , and we have virtually no fear of dry years .
__bs__ And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent , planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants , buffalo , giraffe and other animals that we have .
__bs__ But before we began , our land looked like that .
__bs__ This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got .
__bs__ Okay ? Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature .
__bs__ This was another site where it had been bare and eroding , and at the base of the marked small tree , we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil . Okay ?
__bs__ And again , watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature .
__bs__ And there are fallen trees in there now , because the better land is now attracting elephants , etc .
__bs__ This land in Mexico was in terrible condition , and I &apos;ve had to mark the hill because the change is so profound .
__bs__ ( Applause ) I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland , and thankfully , now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future .
__bs__ And look at the amazing change in this one , where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature , and once more , we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying .
__bs__ The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here .
__bs__ The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher , and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers .
__bs__ They put 25,000 sheep in one flock , really mimicking nature now with planned grazing , and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
__bs__ We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture .
__bs__ Ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals .
__bs__ I remind you that I am talking about most of the world &apos;s land here that controls our fate , including the most violent region of the world , where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land .
__bs__ What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , I believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels .
__bs__ But worse than that , it is causing hunger , poverty , violence , social breakdown and war , and as I am talking to you , millions of men , women and children are suffering and dying .
__bs__ And if this continues , we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing , even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels .
__bs__ I believe I &apos;ve shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this .
__bs__ We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents , and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that , for illustrative purposes , if we do what I am showing you here , we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years , and if we just do that on about half the world &apos;s grasslands that I &apos;ve shown you , we can take us back to pre-industrial levels , while feeding people .
__bs__ I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet , for your children , and their children , and all of humanity .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , Chris .
__bs__ Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have , and I &apos;m sure everyone here has , A ) a hundred questions , B ) wants to hug you .
__bs__ I &apos;m just going to ask you one quick question .
__bs__ When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals , it &apos;s desert . What do they eat ? How does that part work ?
__bs__ How do you start ?
__bs__ Allan Savory : Well , we have done this for a long time , and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation , where it &apos;s 100 percent bare .
__bs__ But many years ago , we took the worst land in Zimbabwe , where I offered a £ 5 note in a hundred-mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred-mile drive , and on that , we trebled the stocking rate , the number of animals , in the first year with no feeding , just by the movement , mimicking nature , and using a sigmoid curve , that principle .
__bs__ It &apos;s a little bit technical to explain here , but just that .
__bs__ CA : Well , I would love to — I mean , this such an interesting and important idea .
__bs__ The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and — I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS : Wonderful .
__bs__ CA : That is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
__bs__ Thank you so much.AS : Well , thank you . Thank you . Thank you , Chris .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m going to talk about religion .
__bs__ But it &apos;s a broad and very delicate subject , so I have to limit myself .
__bs__ And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) This is a very serious talk .
__bs__ So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful .
__bs__ It &apos;s when the young couple whisper , &quot; Tonight we are going to make a baby . &quot;
__bs__ My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman .
__bs__ This is indeed important , because everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet .
__bs__ And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this — three billion in 1960 , seven billion just last year — and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies , and it may continue like this .
__bs__ To what extent are these people right ?
__bs__ When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world , and today , 2000 , there &apos;s almost two billion .
__bs__ What has happened since , and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century ?
__bs__ This is a quiz . What do you think ?
__bs__ Do you think it will decrease to one billion ?
__bs__ Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century ?
__bs__ Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years , or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there ?
__bs__ I will tell you by the end of my speech .
__bs__ But now , what does religion have to do with it ?
__bs__ When you want to classify religion , it &apos;s more difficult than you think .
__bs__ You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this .
__bs__ It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion , but that &apos;s not detailed enough .
__bs__ So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia , we found this map .
__bs__ But that subdivides Christianity , Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups , which was too detailed .
__bs__ Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map , and it looks like this .
__bs__ Each country &apos;s a bubble .
__bs__ The size is the population — big China , big India here .
__bs__ And the color now is the majority religion .
__bs__ It &apos;s the religion where more than 50 percent of the people say that they belong .
__bs__ It &apos;s Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries .
__bs__ Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East , Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia .
__bs__ That &apos;s where we find Islamic majority .
__bs__ And Christian majority religions , we see in these countries . They are blue .
__bs__ And that is most countries in America and Europe , many countries in Africa and a few in Asia .
__bs__ The white here are countries which cannot be classified , because one religion does not reach 50 percent or there is doubt about the data or there &apos;s some other reason .
__bs__ So we were careful with that .
__bs__ So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot .
__bs__ This is in 1960 .
__bs__ And now I show the number of babies per woman here : two , four or six — many babies , few babies .
__bs__ And here the income per person in comparable dollars .
__bs__ The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies .
__bs__ So low income here , high income there .
__bs__ And indeed in 1960 , you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies .
__bs__ The exception was Japan .
__bs__ Japan here was regarded as an exception .
__bs__ Otherwise it was only Christian countries .
__bs__ But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
__bs__ But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa .
__bs__ And countries with Islam as the majority religion , all of them almost had six to seven children per woman , irregardless of the income level .
__bs__ And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level .
__bs__ Now let &apos;s see what has happened in the world .
__bs__ I start the world , and here we go .
__bs__ Now 1962 — can you see they &apos;re getting a little richer , but the number of babies per woman is falling ?
__bs__ Look at China . They &apos;re falling fairly fast .
__bs__ And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range .
__bs__ And when we enter into this century , you &apos;ll find more than half of mankind down here .
__bs__ And by 2010 , we are actually 80 percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman .
__bs__ ( Applause ) It &apos;s a quite amazing development which has happened . ( Applause )
__bs__ And these are countries from United States here , with $ 40,000 per capita , France , Russia , Iran , Mexico , Turkey , Algeria , Indonesia , India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam , which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States and the same amount of babies per woman .
__bs__ I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries .
__bs__ We get that from the census data .
__bs__ It &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
__bs__ So what we can conclude is you don &apos;t have to get rich to have few children .
__bs__ It has happened across the world .
__bs__ And then when we look at religions , we can see that the Eastern religions , indeed there &apos;s not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children .
__bs__ Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity , you see countries all the way .
__bs__ But there &apos;s no major difference .
__bs__ There &apos;s no major difference between these religions .
__bs__ There is a difference with income .
__bs__ The countries which have many babies per woman here , they have quite low income .
__bs__ Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa .
__bs__ But there are also countries here like Guatemala , like Papua New Guinea , like Yemen and Afghanistan .
__bs__ Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo , which have suffered severe conflicts , that they don &apos;t have fast population growth .
__bs__ It &apos;s the other way around .
__bs__ In the world today , it &apos;s the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth .
__bs__ Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child .
__bs__ These countries have six children per woman .
__bs__ They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman .
__bs__ But 30 years from now , Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million .
__bs__ Congo will go from 60 to 120 .
__bs__ That &apos;s where we have the fast population growth .
__bs__ And many think that these countries are stagnant , but they are not .
__bs__ Let me compare Senegal , a Muslim dominated country , with a Christian dominated country , Ghana .
__bs__ I take them backwards here to their independence , when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s .
__bs__ Just look what they have done .
__bs__ It &apos;s an amazing improvement , from seven children per woman , they &apos;ve gone all the way down to between four and five .
__bs__ It &apos;s a tremendous improvement .
__bs__ So what does it take ?
__bs__ Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries .
__bs__ You need to have children to survive .
__bs__ You need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family .
__bs__ You need to have access to some family planning .
__bs__ And you need the fourth factor , which perhaps is the most important factor .
__bs__ But let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar .
__bs__ Here we have Qatar today , and there we have Bangladesh today .
__bs__ If I take these countries back to the years of their independence , which is almost the same year — &apos; 71 , &apos; 72 — it &apos;s a quite amazing development which had happened .
__bs__ Look at Bangladesh and Qatar .
__bs__ With so different incomes , it &apos;s almost the same drop in number of babies per woman .
__bs__ And what is the reason in Qatar ?
__bs__ Well I do as I always do .
__bs__ I went to the statistical authority of Qatar , to their webpage — It &apos;s a very good webpage . I recommend it — and I looked up — oh yeah , you can have lots of fun here — and provided free of charge , I found Qatar &apos;s social trends .
__bs__ Very interesting . Lots to read .
__bs__ I found fertility at birth , and I looked at total fertility rate per woman .
__bs__ These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar , and they say the most important factors are : &quot; &quot; Increased age at first marriage , increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force . &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t agree more . Science couldn &apos;t agree more .
__bs__ This is a country that indeed has gone through a very , very interesting modernization .
__bs__ So what it is , is these four : Children should survive , children shouldn &apos;t be needed for work , women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible .
__bs__ Now look again at this .
__bs__ The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia — it &apos;s 2.4 today .
__bs__ There are countries up here which are very poor .
__bs__ And that &apos;s where family planning , better child survival is needed .
__bs__ I strongly recommend Melinda Gates &apos; last TEDTalk .
__bs__ And here , down , there are many countries which are less than two children per woman .
__bs__ So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz , it &apos;s two .
__bs__ We have reached peak child .
__bs__ The number of children is not growing any longer in the world .
__bs__ We are still debating peak oil , but we have definitely reached peak child .
__bs__ And the world population will stop growing .
__bs__ The United Nations Population Division has said it will stop growing at 10 billion .
__bs__ But why do they grow if the number of children doesn &apos;t grow ?
__bs__ Well I will show you here .
__bs__ I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came .
__bs__ They are quite useful for educational purposes .
__bs__ Each card box is one billion people .
__bs__ And there are two billion children in the world .
__bs__ There are two billion young people between 15 and 30 .
__bs__ These are rounded numbers .
__bs__ Then there is one billion between 30 and 45 , almost one between 45 and 60 .
__bs__ And then it &apos;s my box .
__bs__ This is me : 60-plus .
__bs__ We are here on top .
__bs__ So what will happen now is what we call &quot; &quot; the big fill-up . &quot; &quot; You can see that it &apos;s like three billion missing here .
__bs__ They are not missing because they &apos;ve died ; they were never born .
__bs__ Because before 1980 , there were much fewer people born than there were during the last 30 years .
__bs__ So what will happen now is quite straightforward .
__bs__ The old , sadly , we will die .
__bs__ The rest of you , you will grow older and you will get two billion children .
__bs__ Then the old will die .
__bs__ The rest will grow older and get two billion children .
__bs__ And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
__bs__ ( Applause ) This is the great fill-up .
__bs__ It &apos;s inevitable .
__bs__ And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children ?
__bs__ Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman .
__bs__ All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
__bs__ And we will be just 10 billion in this world , if the poorest people get out of poverty , their children survive , they get access to family planning .
__bs__ That is needed .
__bs__ But it &apos;s inevitable that we will be two to three billion more .
__bs__ So when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future , for human beings on this planet , you have to plan for 10 billion .
__bs__ Thank you very much .

__bs__ Two years ago , I was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of Islamic art in Europe .
__bs__ The curator had only one condition : I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork .
__bs__ Now , as an artist , a woman , an Arab , or a human being living in the world in 2010 , I only had one thing to say : I wanted to say no .
__bs__ And in Arabic , to say &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; we say &quot; &quot; no , and a thousand times no . &quot; &quot; So I decided to look for a thousand different noes .
__bs__ on everything ever produced under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years , from Spain to the borders of China .
__bs__ I collected my findings in a book , placed them chronologically , stating the name , the patron , the medium and the date .
__bs__ Now , the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation , which stood three by seven meters , in Munich , Germany , in September of 2010 .
__bs__ Now , in January , 2011 , the revolution started , and life stopped for 18 days , and on the 12th of February , we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo , believing that the revolution had succeeded .
__bs__ Nine months later I found myself spraying messages in Tahrir Square . The reason for this act was this image that I saw in my newsfeed .
__bs__ I did not feel that I could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street .
__bs__ So I took one &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; off a tombstone from the Islamic Museum in Cairo , and I added a message to it : &quot; no to military rule . &quot;
__bs__ And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo .
__bs__ But that led to a series of no , coming out of the book like ammunition , and adding messages to them , and I started spraying them on the walls .
__bs__ So I &apos;ll be sharing some of these noes with you .
__bs__ No to a new Pharaoh , because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator .
__bs__ No to violence : Ramy Essam came to Tahrir on the second day of the revolution , and he sat there with this guitar , singing .
__bs__ One month after Mubarak stepped down , this was his reward .
__bs__ No to blinding heroes . Ahmed Harara lost his right eye on the 28th of January , and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November , by two different snipers .
__bs__ No to killing , in this case no to killing men of religion , because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot on December 16th , during a demonstration , leaving behind three orphans and a widow .
__bs__ No to burning books . The Institute of Egypt was burned on December 17th , a huge cultural loss .
__bs__ No to stripping the people , and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street , and the footprint reads , &quot; Long live a peaceful revolution , &quot; because we will never retaliate with violence .
__bs__ No to barrier walls . On February 5th , concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters .
__bs__ Now , speaking of walls , I want to share with you the story of one wall in Cairo .
__bs__ A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall . It &apos;s one to one .
__bs__ In front of this tank there &apos;s a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head . To any passerby , there &apos;s no problem with this visual .
__bs__ After acts of violence , another artist came , painted blood , protesters being run over by the tank , demonstrators , and a message that read , &quot; &quot; Starting tomorrow , I wear the new face , the face of every martyr . I exist . &quot; &quot; Authority comes , paints the wall white , leaves the tank and adds a message : &quot; Army and people , one hand . Egypt for Egyptians . &quot;
__bs__ Another artist comes , paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank .
__bs__ Authority comes , paints the wall white , leaves the tank , leaves the suit , and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster .
__bs__ So I come with my stencils , and I spray them on the suit , on the tank , and on the whole wall , and this is how it stands today until further notice . ( Laughter ) Now , I want to leave you with a final no .
__bs__ I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in Tahrir , and I decided to take a no of Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo .
__bs__ The message reads , &#91; Arabic &#93; &quot; You can crush the flowers , but you can &apos;t delay spring . &quot;
__bs__ Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Shukran . ( Applause )
__bs__ So why do we learn mathematics ?
__bs__ Essentially , for three reasons : calculation , application , and last , and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it , inspiration .
__bs__ Mathematics is the science of patterns , and we study it to learn how to think logically , critically and creatively , but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated , and when our students ask , &quot; Why are we learning this ? &quot;
__bs__ then they often hear that they &apos;ll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test .
__bs__ But wouldn &apos;t it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind ?
__bs__ Now , I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen , so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers , the Fibonacci numbers . ( Applause ) Yeah ! I already have Fibonacci fans here .
__bs__ That &apos;s great .
__bs__ Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
__bs__ From the standpoint of calculation , they &apos;re as easy to understand as one plus one , which is two .
__bs__ Then one plus two is three , two plus three is five , three plus five is eight , and so on .
__bs__ Indeed , the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa , and these numbers appear in his book &quot; &quot; Liber Abaci , &quot; &quot; which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today .
__bs__ In terms of applications , Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often .
__bs__ The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number , or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well .
__bs__ In fact , there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers , but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display .
__bs__ Let me show you one of my favorites .
__bs__ Suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ? ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers .
__bs__ So one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on .
__bs__ Now , it &apos;s no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers , you get the next Fibonacci number . Right ?
__bs__ That &apos;s how they &apos;re created .
__bs__ But you wouldn &apos;t expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together .
__bs__ But check this out .
__bs__ One plus one gives us two , and one plus four gives us five .
__bs__ And four plus nine is 13 , nine plus 25 is 34 , and yes , the pattern continues .
__bs__ In fact , here &apos;s another one .
__bs__ Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers .
__bs__ Let &apos;s see what we get there .
__bs__ So one plus one plus four is six .
__bs__ Add nine to that , we get 15 .
__bs__ Add 25 , we get 40 .
__bs__ Add 64 , we get 104 .
__bs__ Now look at those numbers .
__bs__ Those are not Fibonacci numbers , but if you look at them closely , you &apos;ll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them .
__bs__ Do you see it ? I &apos;ll show it to you .
__bs__ Six is two times three , 15 is three times five , 40 is five times eight , two , three , five , eight , who do we appreciate ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Fibonacci ! Of course .
__bs__ Now , as much fun as it is to discover these patterns , it &apos;s even more satisfying to understand why they are true .
__bs__ Let &apos;s look at that last equation .
__bs__ Why should the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 ?
__bs__ I &apos;ll show you by drawing a simple picture .
__bs__ We &apos;ll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square .
__bs__ Together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
__bs__ Beneath that , I &apos;ll put a two-by-two square , and next to that , a three-by-three square , beneath that , a five-by-five square , and then an eight-by-eight square , creating one giant rectangle , right ?
__bs__ Now let me ask you a simple question : what is the area of the rectangle ?
__bs__ Well , on the one hand , it &apos;s the sum of the areas of the squares inside it , right ?
__bs__ Just as we created it .
__bs__ It &apos;s one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared . Right ?
__bs__ That &apos;s the area .
__bs__ On the other hand , because it &apos;s a rectangle , the area is equal to its height times its base , and the height is clearly eight , and the base is five plus eight , which is the next Fibonacci number , 13 . Right ?
__bs__ So the area is also eight times 13 .
__bs__ Since we &apos;ve correctly calculated the area two different ways , they have to be the same number , and that &apos;s why the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 .
__bs__ Now , if we continue this process , we &apos;ll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21 , 21 by 34 , and so on .
__bs__ Now check this out .
__bs__ If you divide 13 by eight , you get 1.625 .
__bs__ And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number , then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618 , known to many people as the Golden Ratio , a number which has fascinated mathematicians , scientists and artists for centuries .
__bs__ Now , I show all this to you because , like so much of mathematics , there &apos;s a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools .
__bs__ We spend lots of time learning about calculation , but let &apos;s not forget about application , including , perhaps , the most important application of all , learning how to think .
__bs__ If I could summarize this in one sentence , it would be this : Mathematics is not just solving for x , it &apos;s also figuring out why .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ So I &apos;m a neurosurgeon .
__bs__ And like most of my colleagues , I have to deal , every day , with human tragedies .
__bs__ I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident .
__bs__ And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body , the brain has very little ability for self-repair .
__bs__ And after a major injury of your central nervous system , the patients often remain with a severe handicap .
__bs__ And that &apos;s probably the reason why I &apos;ve chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon .
__bs__ What is a functional neurosurgeon ?
__bs__ It &apos;s a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies .
__bs__ You &apos;ve certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation , where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function .
__bs__ It &apos;s really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , with severe tremor , with severe pain .
__bs__ However , neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair .
__bs__ And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain .
__bs__ I think that we are approaching this dream .
__bs__ And I would like to show you that we are very close to this .
__bs__ And that with a little bit of help , the brain is able to help itself .
__bs__ So the story started 15 years ago .
__bs__ At that time , I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room .
__bs__ I often had to take care of patients with head trauma .
__bs__ You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he &apos;s increasing his intracranial pressure .
__bs__ And in order to save his life , you have to decrease this intracranial pressure .
__bs__ And to do that , you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain .
__bs__ So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain , we decided with Jean-François Brunet , who is a colleague of mine , a biologist , to study them .
__bs__ What do I mean by that ?
__bs__ We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue .
__bs__ It &apos;s not an easy task .
__bs__ Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family .
__bs__ So you need to find the right nutrients , the warmth , the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive .
__bs__ So that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
__bs__ And after many attempts , Jean-François did it .
__bs__ And that &apos;s what he saw under his microscope .
__bs__ And that was , for us , a major surprise .
__bs__ Why ?
__bs__ Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture , with large green cells surrounding small , immature cells .
__bs__ And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells , able to turn into any type of cell of the body .
__bs__ The adult brain has stem cells , but they &apos;re very rare and they &apos;re located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain .
__bs__ So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater .
__bs__ And there was another intriguing observation : Regular stem cells are very active cells — cells that divide , divide , divide very quickly .
__bs__ And they never die , they &apos;re immortal cells .
__bs__ But these cells behave differently .
__bs__ They divide slowly , and after a few weeks of culture , they even died .
__bs__ So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently .
__bs__ And it took us a long time to understand where they came from .
__bs__ They come from these cells .
__bs__ These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells .
__bs__ All of you have them in your brain .
__bs__ They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells .
__bs__ They have a very important role during the development stage .
__bs__ When you were fetuses , they helped your brain to fold itself .
__bs__ But why do they stay in your head ?
__bs__ This , we don &apos;t know .
__bs__ We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions .
__bs__ But it &apos;s not so sure .
__bs__ But there is one clear thing — that from these cells , we got our stem cell culture .
__bs__ And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain .
__bs__ And we had to prove this .
__bs__ So to prove it , we decided to design an experimental paradigm .
__bs__ The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain , and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab .
__bs__ And then label them , to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain .
__bs__ And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual .
__bs__ We call these autologous grafts — autografts .
__bs__ So the first question we had , &quot; &quot; What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain , and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain ? &quot; &quot; Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller , we worked with monkeys .
__bs__ So in the first-case scenario , we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken from the brain , they go back home , the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
__bs__ In the second-case scenario , we performed the lesion , we re-implanted exactly the same cells , and in this case , the cells remained — and they became mature neurons .
__bs__ And that &apos;s the image of what we could observe under the microscope .
__bs__ Those are the cells that were re-implanted .
__bs__ And the proof they carry , these little spots , those are the cells that we &apos;ve labeled in vitro , when they were in culture .
__bs__ But we could not stop here , of course .
__bs__ Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion ?
__bs__ So for that , we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task .
__bs__ They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray .
__bs__ They were very good at it .
__bs__ And when they had reached a plateau of performance , we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion .
__bs__ So the monkeys were plegic , they could not move their hand anymore .
__bs__ And exactly the same as humans would do , they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent , exactly the same as after a stroke .
__bs__ Patients are completely plegic , and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism , they recover to a certain extent , exactly the same for the monkey .
__bs__ So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery , we implanted his own cells .
__bs__ So on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered .
__bs__ He &apos;s at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion .
__bs__ He &apos;s not so accurate , not so quick .
__bs__ And look now when we re-implant the cells : Two months after re-implantation , the same individual .
__bs__ ( Applause ) It was also very exciting results for us , I tell you .
__bs__ Since that time , we &apos;ve understood much more about these cells .
__bs__ We know that we can cryopreserve them , we can use them later on .
__bs__ We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models , like Parkinson &apos;s disease , for example .
__bs__ But our dream is still to implant them in humans .
__bs__ And I really hope that I &apos;ll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Bruno Giussani : Jocelyne , this is amazing , and I &apos;m sure that right now , there are several dozen people in the audience , possibly even a majority , who are thinking , &quot; &quot; I know somebody who can use this . &quot; &quot; I do , in any case .
__bs__ And of course the question is , what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials ?
__bs__ Jocelyne Bloch : The biggest obstacles are regulations . ( Laughs ) So , from these exciting results , you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials .
__bs__ BG : Which is understandable , the brain is delicate , etc .
__bs__ JB : Yes , it is , but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it , you know ?
__bs__ BG : If you project yourself — having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials , if you project yourself out in time , how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available ?
__bs__ JB : So , it &apos;s very difficult to say .
__bs__ It depends , first , on the approval of the trial .
__bs__ Will the regulation allow us to do it soon ?
__bs__ And then , you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients .
__bs__ So it takes , already , a long time to select the patients , do the treatment and evaluate if it &apos;s useful to do this kind of treatment .
__bs__ And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial .
__bs__ You have to really prove first that it &apos;s useful before offering this treatment up for everybody .
__bs__ BG : And safe , of course . JB : Of course .
__bs__ BG : Jocelyne , thank you for coming to TED and sharing this .
__bs__ BG : Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Three and a half years ago , I made one of the best decisions of my life .
__bs__ As my New Year &apos;s resolution , I gave up dieting , stopped worrying about my weight , and learned to eat mindfully .
__bs__ Now I eat whenever I &apos;m hungry , and I &apos;ve lost 10 pounds .
__bs__ This was me at age 13 , when I started my first diet .
__bs__ I look at that picture now , and I think , you did not need a diet , you needed a fashion consult .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But I thought I needed to lose weight , and when I gained it back , of course I blamed myself .
__bs__ And for the next three decades , I was on and off various diets .
__bs__ No matter what I tried , the weight I &apos;d lost always came back .
__bs__ I &apos;m sure many of you know the feeling .
__bs__ As a neuroscientist , I wondered , why is this so hard ?
__bs__ What most people don &apos;t realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain , mostly without your awareness .
__bs__ Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes , and that is a good thing , because your conscious mind — how do we put this politely ? — it &apos;s easily distracted .
__bs__ It &apos;s good that you don &apos;t have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie .
__bs__ You don &apos;t forget how to walk because you &apos;re thinking about what to have for dinner .
__bs__ Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh , no matter what you consciously believe .
__bs__ This is called your set point , but that &apos;s a misleading term , because it &apos;s actually a range of about 10 or 15 pounds .
__bs__ You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range , but it &apos;s much , much harder to stay outside of it .
__bs__ The hypothalamus , the part of the brain that regulates body weight , there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight , more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it , and the system works like a thermostat , responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger , activity and metabolism , to keep your weight stable as conditions change .
__bs__ That &apos;s what a thermostat does , right ?
__bs__ It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside .
__bs__ Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter , but that &apos;s not going to change the setting on the thermostat , which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up .
__bs__ Your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
__bs__ If you lose a lot of weight , your brain reacts as if you were starving , and whether you started out fat or thin , your brain &apos;s response is exactly the same .
__bs__ We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not , but it can &apos;t .
__bs__ If you do lose a lot of weight , you become hungry , and your muscles burn less energy .
__bs__ Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
__bs__ That &apos;s a lot of food .
__bs__ This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin .
__bs__ Over the course of human history , starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating .
__bs__ This may explain a very sad fact : Set points can go up , but they rarely go down .
__bs__ Now , if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair , this is the kind of thing she was talking about .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Successful dieting doesn &apos;t lower your set point .
__bs__ Even after you &apos;ve kept the weight off for as long as seven years , your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back .
__bs__ If that weight loss had been due to a long famine , that would be a sensible response .
__bs__ In our modern world of drive-thru burgers , it &apos;s not working out so well for many of us .
__bs__ That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available , and it &apos;s also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity .
__bs__ Sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
__bs__ If you stay at a high weight for too long , probably a matter of years for most of us , your brain may decide that that &apos;s the new normal .
__bs__ Psychologists classify eaters into two groups , those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower , like most dieters .
__bs__ Let &apos;s call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters .
__bs__ The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight , and they spend less time thinking about food .
__bs__ Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising , super-sizing , and the all-you-can-eat buffet .
__bs__ And a small indulgence , like eating one scoop of ice cream , is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters .
__bs__ Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
__bs__ Several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders .
__bs__ The other factor , by the way , those of you who are parents , was being teased by family members about their weight .
__bs__ So don &apos;t do that .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) I left almost all my graphs at home , but I couldn &apos;t resist throwing in just this one , because I &apos;m a geek , and that &apos;s how I roll . ( Laughter )
__bs__ This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14-year period based on four healthy habits : eating enough fruits and vegetables , exercise three times a week , not smoking , and drinking in moderation .
__bs__ Let &apos;s start by looking at the normal weight people in the study .
__bs__ The height of the bars is the risk of death , and those zero , one , two , three , four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had .
__bs__ And as you &apos;d expect , the healthier the lifestyle , the less likely people were to die during the study .
__bs__ Now let &apos;s look at what happens in overweight people .
__bs__ The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death .
__bs__ Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range .
__bs__ For obese people with no healthy habits , the risk is very high , seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study .
__bs__ But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too .
__bs__ Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
__bs__ Five years after a diet , most people have regained the weight .
__bs__ Forty percent of them have gained even more .
__bs__ If I &apos;ve convinced you that dieting might be a problem , the next question is , what do you do about it ?
__bs__ And my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
__bs__ I &apos;m not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga .
__bs__ I &apos;m talking about mindful eating : learning to understand your body &apos;s signals so that you eat when you &apos;re hungry and stop when you &apos;re full , because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you &apos;re not hungry .
__bs__ How do you do it ?
__bs__ Give yourself permission to eat as much as you want , and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good .
__bs__ It took about a year for me to learn this , but it &apos;s really been worth it .
__bs__ I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life .
__bs__ I often don &apos;t think about it .
__bs__ I forget we have chocolate in the house .
__bs__ It &apos;s like aliens have taken over my brain .
__bs__ It &apos;s just completely different .
__bs__ I should say that this approach to eating probably won &apos;t make you lose weight unless you often eat when you &apos;re not hungry , but doctors don &apos;t know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people , and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss .
__bs__ Let &apos;s face it : If diets worked , we &apos;d all be thin already .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results ?
__bs__ Diets may seem harmless , but they actually do a lot of collateral damage .
__bs__ At worst , they ruin lives : Weight obsession leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
__bs__ In the U.S. , we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls say they &apos;ve been on a diet .
__bs__ Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale .
__bs__ Even at its best , dieting is a waste of time and energy .
__bs__ It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project , and because willpower is limited , any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else .
__bs__ Let me leave you with one last thought .
__bs__ What if we told all those dieting girls that it &apos;s okay to eat when they &apos;re hungry ?
__bs__ What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it ?
__bs__ I think most of them would be happier and healthier , and as adults , many of them would probably be thinner .
__bs__ I wish someone had told me that back when I was 13 .
__bs__ Thanks .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ This is a work in process , based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine .
__bs__ ( Music ) ( Video ) Narrator : On this planet , 1.6 billion people don &apos;t have access to electricity , refrigeration or stored fuels .
__bs__ This is a problem .
__bs__ It impacts : the spread of disease , the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life .
__bs__ So here &apos;s the plan : inexpensive refrigeration that doesn &apos;t use electricity , propane , gas , kerosene or consumables .
__bs__ Time for some thermodynamics .
__bs__ And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator .
__bs__ Adam Grosser : So 29 years ago , I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
__bs__ It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
__bs__ It was a lot like the Stirling engine : it was cool , but you didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
__bs__ And it was invented in 1858 , by this guy Ferdinand Carre , but he couldn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
__bs__ This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928 , and it was a really neat idea , and I &apos;ll get to why it didn &apos;t work , but here &apos;s how it works .
__bs__ There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
__bs__ One has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser .
__bs__ You heat up one side , the hot side .
__bs__ The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
__bs__ You let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
__bs__ So , it was a great idea that didn &apos;t work at all : it blew up .
__bs__ Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
__bs__ It topped 400 psi . The ammonia was toxic . It sprayed everywhere .
__bs__ But it was kind of an interesting thought .
__bs__ So , the great thing about 2006 is there &apos;s a lot of really great computational work you can do .
__bs__ So , we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved — a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
__bs__ We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
__bs__ We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures .
__bs__ Brought in a team from the U.K. — there &apos;s a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the U.K. — and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
__bs__ So , this is the way it works .
__bs__ You put it on a cooking fire .
__bs__ Most people have cooking fires in the world , whether it &apos;s camel dung or wood .
__bs__ It heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
__bs__ Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours .
__bs__ It looks like this . This is the fifth prototype . It &apos;s not quite done .
__bs__ Weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
__bs__ You put it into a 15-liter vessel , about three gallons , and it &apos;ll cool it down to just above freezing — three degrees above freezing — for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment . It &apos;s really cheap .
__bs__ We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
__bs__ And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
__bs__ Thank you .

__bs__ Hello , my name is Thomas Heatherwick .
__bs__ I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings .
__bs__ When I was growing up , I was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale .
__bs__ And I was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications I was seeing felt soulless and cold .
__bs__ And there on the smaller scale , the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument , was a materiality and a soulfulness .
__bs__ And this influenced me .
__bs__ The first building I built was 20 years ago .
__bs__ And since , in the last 20 years , I &apos;ve developed a studio in London .
__bs__ Sorry , this was my mother , by the way , in her bead shop in London .
__bs__ I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that .
__bs__ I &apos;m just going to show , for people who don &apos;t know my studio &apos;s work , a few projects that we &apos;ve worked on .
__bs__ This is a hospital building .
__bs__ This is a shop for a bag company .
__bs__ This is studios for artists .
__bs__ This is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball .
__bs__ And this is a window display .
__bs__ And this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St. Paul &apos;s Cathedral in London .
__bs__ And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk .
__bs__ And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain .
__bs__ And just very quickly , something we &apos;ve been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again .
__bs__ Because the original Routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with , which had this open platform at the back — in fact , I think all our Routemasters are here in California now actually .
__bs__ But they aren &apos;t in London .
__bs__ And so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
__bs__ And if the bus is going to stop and it &apos;s three yards away from the bus stop , you &apos;re just a prisoner .
__bs__ But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform .
__bs__ So we &apos;ve been working with Transport for London , and that organization hasn &apos;t actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years .
__bs__ And so we &apos;ve been very lucky to have a chance to work .
__bs__ The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
__bs__ So it &apos;s got hybrid drive .
__bs__ And we &apos;ve been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics .
__bs__ I was going to show four main projects .
__bs__ And this is a project for a bridge .
__bs__ And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
__bs__ And openings seemed — everyone loves opening bridges , but it &apos;s quite a basic thing .
__bs__ I think we all kind of stand and watch .
__bs__ But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed — I &apos;m slightly squeamish — but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball .
__bs__ And as he was diving , someone had stamped on his knee , and it had broken like this .
__bs__ And then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn &apos;t help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken .
__bs__ And so this is in Paddington in London .
__bs__ And it &apos;s a very boring bridge , as you can see .
__bs__ It &apos;s just steel and timber .
__bs__ But instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
__bs__ ( Applause ) So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other . ( Applause )
__bs__ We actually had to halve its speed , because everyone was too scared when we first did it .
__bs__ So that &apos;s it speeded up .
__bs__ A project that we &apos;ve been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station — so a power station that uses organic waste material .
__bs__ In the news , the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time .
__bs__ And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power .
__bs__ But recently , any annual report of a power company doesn &apos;t have a power station on it .
__bs__ It has a child running through a field , or something like that .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station , our condition was that we would work with them and that , whatever we did , we were not just going to decorate a normal power station .
__bs__ And instead , we had to learn — we kind of forced them to teach us .
__bs__ And so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren &apos;t being capitalized on .
__bs__ That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn &apos;t necessarily the most efficient way that they could work .
__bs__ So we looked at how we could compose all those elements — instead of just litter , create one composition .
__bs__ And what we found — this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain .
__bs__ It was voted the worst place in Britain to live .
__bs__ And there are 2,000 new homes being built next to this power station .
__bs__ So it felt this has a social dimension .
__bs__ It has a symbolic importance .
__bs__ And we should be proud of where our power is coming from , rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of .
__bs__ So we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
__bs__ And it has to be — I &apos;m trying to get my — 250 feet high .
__bs__ So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in , and using the spare soil that &apos;s there on the site , we could make a power station that was silent as well .
__bs__ Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .
__bs__ And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this .
__bs__ The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station .
__bs__ It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a power park .
__bs__ So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area , and use that height that we have to have for its function .
__bs__ In Shanghai , we were invited to build — well we weren &apos;t invited ; what am I talking about .
__bs__ We won the competition , and it was painful to get there .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion .
__bs__ And an expo is a totally bonkers thing .
__bs__ There &apos;s 250 pavilions .
__bs__ It &apos;s the world &apos;s biggest ever expo that had ever happened .
__bs__ So there are up to a million people there everyday .
__bs__ And 250 countries all competing .
__bs__ And the British government saying , &quot; You need to be in the top five . &quot;
__bs__ And so that became the governmental goal — is , how do you stand out in this chaos , which is an expo of stimulus ?
__bs__ So our sense was we had to do one thing , and only one thing , instead of trying to have everything .
__bs__ And so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn &apos;t do a cheesy advert for Britain .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But the thing that was true , the expo was about the future of cities , and particularly the Victorians pioneered integrating nature into the cities .
__bs__ And the world &apos;s first public park of modern times was in Britain .
__bs__ And the world &apos;s first major botanical institution is in London , and they have this extraordinary project where they &apos;ve been collecting 25 percent of all the world &apos;s plant species .
__bs__ So we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
__bs__ And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful , and I &apos;ve never met anyone who says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like trees . &quot; &quot; And the same with flowers .
__bs__ I &apos;ve never met anyone who says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like flowers . &quot; &quot; But we realized that seeds — there &apos;s been this very serious project happening — but that seeds — at these major botanical gardens , seeds aren &apos;t on show .
__bs__ But you just have to go to a garden center , and they &apos;re in little paper packets .
__bs__ But this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
__bs__ So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds , some kind of seed cathedral .
__bs__ But how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
__bs__ And the film &quot; &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; &quot; actually really helped us .
__bs__ Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious , rather than looking like nuts .
__bs__ So the challenge was , how are we going to bring light and expose these things ?
__bs__ We didn &apos;t want to make a separate building and have separate content .
__bs__ So we were trying to think , how could we make a whole thing emanate .
__bs__ By the way , we had half the budget of the other Western nations .
__bs__ So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch .
__bs__ And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .
__bs__ ( Video ) Voice Over : The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop .
__bs__ Song : ♫ We &apos;ve got the Mop Tops , the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫ ♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫ ♫ They &apos;re the Mop Tops ♫ Thomas Heatherwick : Okay , you get the idea .
__bs__ So the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us , and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box , very simple box element , and make it a building that could move in the wind .
__bs__ So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows .
__bs__ And inside , the daylight — each one is an optic and it brings light into the center .
__bs__ And by night , artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside .
__bs__ And to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
__bs__ Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch , we focused it on this one element .
__bs__ And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else , and focus our energy on that .
__bs__ And so the rest of the site was a public space .
__bs__ And with a million people there a day , it just felt like offering some public space .
__bs__ We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini-me version of the seed cathedral , so that , even if you &apos;re partially-sighted , that it was kind of crunchy and soft , that piece of landscape that you see there .
__bs__ And then , you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur — in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral , in effect , we &apos;ve shaved it .
__bs__ And inside there &apos;s nothing ; there &apos;s no famous actor &apos;s voice ; there &apos;s no projections ; there &apos;s no televisions ; there &apos;s no color changing .
__bs__ There &apos;s just silence and a cool temperature .
__bs__ And if a cloud goes past , you can see a cloud on the tips where it &apos;s letting the light through .
__bs__ This is the only project that we &apos;ve done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) A key thing was how people would interact .
__bs__ I mean , in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo .
__bs__ And I just wanted to show you .
__bs__ The British government — any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
__bs__ And there was a lot of terror .
__bs__ But there was an underlying support .
__bs__ And so there was a moment when suddenly — actually , the next thing .
__bs__ This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment , who was our client , with the Chinese children , using the landscape .
__bs__ ( Video ) Children : One , two , three , go .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) TH : I &apos;m sorry about my stupid voice there . ( Laughter )
__bs__ So finally , texture is something .
__bs__ In the projects we &apos;ve been working on , these slick buildings , where they might be a fancy shape , but the materiality feels the same , is something that we &apos;ve been trying to research really , and explore alternatives .
__bs__ And the project that we &apos;re building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer .
__bs__ And it &apos;s in a piece of land that &apos;s this site .
__bs__ And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that , if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city , they would give them more gross floor area , buildable .
__bs__ So there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city .
__bs__ And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower , and you squeeze a few trees around the edge , and you see cars parked .
__bs__ It &apos;s actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience , and the rest of it is just for postcards .
__bs__ The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this .
__bs__ So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom , we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer .
__bs__ And by linking these together , we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest , instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings .
__bs__ ( Applause ) So we &apos;re building these buildings .
__bs__ They &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
__bs__ They &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
__bs__ But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape , rather than engulf it .
__bs__ And that &apos;s my final slide .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__bs__ June Cohen : So thank you . Thank you , Thomas . You &apos;re a delight .
__bs__ Since we have an extra minute here , I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds , which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building .
__bs__ TH : These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure .
__bs__ So there were 66,000 of these .
__bs__ This optic was 22 feet long .
__bs__ And so the daylight was just coming — it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed .
__bs__ Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy .
__bs__ Because it &apos;s quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway , but if you say you &apos;re going to drill 66,000 holes in it — we had quite a time .
__bs__ There was one person in the contractors who was the right size — and it wasn &apos;t a child — who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building .
__bs__ JC : Thank you , Thomas .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Pull the knot .
__bs__ It &apos;s easy to forget that last night , one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity .
__bs__ One billion people .
__bs__ Two and a half billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels or clean heating fuels .
__bs__ Those are the problems in the developing world .
__bs__ And it &apos;s easy for us not to be empathetic with those people who seem so distanced from us .
__bs__ But even in our own world , the developed world , we see the tension of stagnant economies impacting the lives of people around us .
__bs__ We see it in whole pieces of the economy , where the people involved have lost hope about the future and despair about the present .
__bs__ We see that in the Brexit vote .
__bs__ We see that in the Sanders / Trump campaigns in my own country .
__bs__ But even in countries as recently turning the corner towards being in the developed world , in China , we see the difficulty that President Xi has as he begins to un-employ so many people in his coal and mining industries who see no future for themselves .
__bs__ As we as a society figure out how to manage the problems of the developed world and the problems of the developing world , we have to look at how we move forward and manage the environmental impact of those decisions .
__bs__ We &apos;ve been working on this problem for 25 years , since Rio , the Kyoto Protocols .
__bs__ Our most recent move is the Paris treaty , and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world .
__bs__ I think we can be very hopeful that those agreements , which are bottom-up agreements , where nations have said what they think they can do , are genuine and forthcoming for the vast majority of the parties .
__bs__ The unfortunate thing is that now , as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield , the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear .
__bs__ This is the United States Energy Information Agency &apos;s assessment of what will happen if the countries implement the climate commitments that they &apos;ve made in Paris between now and 2040 .
__bs__ It shows basically CO2 emissions around the world over the next 30 years .
__bs__ There are three things that you need to look at and appreciate .
__bs__ One , CO2 emissions are expected to continue to grow for the next 30 years .
__bs__ In order to control climate , CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero because it &apos;s the cumulative emissions that drive heating on the planet .
__bs__ This should tell you that we are losing the race to fossil fuels .
__bs__ The second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries , from China , from India , from the rest of the world , which includes South Africa and Indonesia and Brazil , as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted in the developed world .
__bs__ The final thing that you should notice is that each year , about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet &apos;s atmosphere , and then diffusing into the ocean and into the land .
__bs__ That &apos;s on top of the 550 gigatons that are in place today .
__bs__ At the end of 30 years , we will have put 850 gigatons of carbon into the air , and that probably goes a long way towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase in global mean surface temperatures , locking in ocean acidification and locking in sea level rise .
__bs__ Now , this is a projection made by men by the actions of society , and it &apos;s ours to change , not to accept .
__bs__ But the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate .
__bs__ Different nations make different energy choices .
__bs__ It &apos;s a function of their natural resources .
__bs__ It &apos;s a function of their climate .
__bs__ It &apos;s a function of the development path that they &apos;ve followed as a society .
__bs__ It &apos;s a function of where on the surface of the planet they are .
__bs__ Are they where it &apos;s dark a lot of the time , or are they at the mid-latitudes ?
__bs__ Many , many , many things go into the choices of countries , and they each make a different choice .
__bs__ The overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate is the choice that China has made .
__bs__ China has made the choice , and will make the choice , to run on coal .
__bs__ The United States has an alternative .
__bs__ It can run on natural gas as a result of the inventions of fracking and shale gas , which we have here .
__bs__ They provide an alternative .
__bs__ The OECD Europe has a choice .
__bs__ It has renewables that it can afford to deploy in Germany because it &apos;s rich enough to afford to do it .
__bs__ The French and the British show interest in nuclear power .
__bs__ Eastern Europe , still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal , and with natural gas that comes from Russia , with all of its entanglements .
__bs__ China has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe .
__bs__ If you look at China , and you ask yourself why has coal been important to it , you have to remember what China &apos;s done .
__bs__ China brought people to power , not power to people .
__bs__ It didn &apos;t do rural electrification .
__bs__ It urbanized .
__bs__ It urbanized by taking low-cost labor and low-cost energy , creating export industries that could fund a tremendous amount of growth .
__bs__ If we look at China &apos;s path , all of us know that prosperity in China has dramatically increased .
__bs__ In 1980 , 80 percent of China &apos;s population lived below the extreme poverty level , below the level of having $ 1.90 per person per day .
__bs__ By the year 2000 , only 20 percent of China &apos;s population lived below the extreme poverty level — a remarkable feat , admittedly , with some costs in civil liberties that would be tough to accept in the Western world .
__bs__ But the impact of all that wealth allowed people to get massively better nutrition .
__bs__ It allowed water pipes to be placed .
__bs__ It allowed sewage pipes to be placed , dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases , at the cost of some outdoor air pollution .
__bs__ But in 1980 , and even today , the number one killer in China is indoor air pollution , because people do not have access to clean cooking and heating fuels .
__bs__ In fact , in 2040 , it &apos;s still estimated that 200 million people in China will not have access to clean cooking fuels .
__bs__ They have a remarkable path to follow .
__bs__ India also needs to meet the needs of its own people , and it &apos;s going to do that by burning coal .
__bs__ When we look at the EIA &apos;s projections of coal burning in India , India will supply nearly four times as much of its energy from coal as it will from renewables .
__bs__ It &apos;s not because they don &apos;t know the alternatives ; it &apos;s because rich countries can do what they choose , poor countries do what they must .
__bs__ So what can we do to stop coal &apos;s emissions in time ?
__bs__ What can we do that changes this forecast that &apos;s in front of us ?
__bs__ Because it &apos;s a forecast that we can change if we have the will to do it .
__bs__ First of all , we have to think about the magnitude of the problem .
__bs__ Between now and 2040 , 800 to 1,600 new coal plants are going to be built around the world .
__bs__ This week , between one and three one-gigawatt coal plants are being turned on around the world .
__bs__ That &apos;s happening regardless of what we want , because the people that rule their countries , assessing the interests of their citizens , have decided it &apos;s in the interest of their citizens to do that .
__bs__ And that &apos;s going to happen unless they have a better alternative .
__bs__ And every 100 of those plants will use up between one percent and three percent of the Earth &apos;s climate budget .
__bs__ So every day that you go home thinking that you should do something about global warming , at the end of that week , remember : somebody fired up a coal plant that &apos;s going to run for 50 years and take away your ability to change it .
__bs__ What we &apos;ve forgotten is something that Vinod Khosla used to talk about , a man of Indian ethnicity but an American venture capitalist .
__bs__ And he said , back in the early 2000s , that if you needed to get China and India off of fossil fuels , you had to create a technology that passed the &quot; &quot; Chindia test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chindia &quot; &quot; being the appending of the two words .
__bs__ It had to be first of all viable , meaning that technically , they could implement it in their country , and that it would be accepted by the people in the country .
__bs__ Two , it had to be a technology that was scalable , that it could deliver the same benefits on the same timetable as fossil fuels , so that they can enjoy the kind of life , again , that we take for granted .
__bs__ And third , it had to be cost-effective without subsidy or without mandate .
__bs__ It had to stand on its own two feet ; it could not be maintained for that many people if in fact , those countries had to go begging or had some foreign country say , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t trade with you , &quot; &quot; in order to get the technology shift to occur .
__bs__ If you look at the Chindia test , we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test .
__bs__ That &apos;s what the EIA forecast tells us .
__bs__ China &apos;s building 800 gigawatts of coal , 400 gigawatts of hydro , about 200 gigawatts of nuclear , and on an energy-equivalent basis , adjusting for intermittency , about 100 gigawatts of renewables .
__bs__ 800 gigawatts of coal .
__bs__ They &apos;re doing that , knowing the costs better than any other country , knowing the need better than any other country .
__bs__ But that &apos;s what they &apos;re aiming for in 2040 unless we give them a better choice .
__bs__ To give them a better choice , it &apos;s going to have to meet the Chindia test .
__bs__ If you look at all the alternatives that are out there , there are really two that come near to meeting it .
__bs__ First is this area of new nuclear that I &apos;ll talk about in just a second .
__bs__ It &apos;s a new generation of nuclear plants that are on the drawing boards around the world , and the people who are developing these say we can get them in position to demo by 2025 and to scale by 2030 , if you will just let us .
__bs__ The second alternative that could be there in time is utility-scale solar backed up with natural gas , which we can use today , versus the batteries which are still under development .
__bs__ So what &apos;s holding new nuclear back ?
__bs__ Outdated regulations and yesterday &apos;s mindsets .
__bs__ We have not used our latest scientific thinking on radiological health to think how we communicate with the public and govern the testing of new nuclear reactors .
__bs__ We have new scientific knowledge that we need to use in order to improve the way we regulate nuclear industry .
__bs__ The second thing is we &apos;ve got a mindset that it takes 25 years and 2 to 5 billion dollars to develop a nuclear power plant .
__bs__ That comes from the historical , military mindset of the places nuclear power came from .
__bs__ These new nuclear ventures are saying that they can deliver power for 5 cents a kilowatt hour ; they can deliver it for 100 gigawatts a year ; they can demo it by 2025 ; and they can deliver it in scale by 2030 , if only we give them a chance .
__bs__ Right now , we &apos;re basically waiting for a miracle .
__bs__ What we need is a choice .
__bs__ If they can &apos;t make it safe , if they can &apos;t make it cheap , it should not be deployed .
__bs__ But what I want you to do is not carry an idea forward , but write your leaders , write the head of the NGOs you support , and tell them to give you the choice , not the past .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I &apos;m about to tell you of practical value , let me ask you please to raise your hands : Who here is either over 65 years old or hopes to live past age 65 or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past 65 , raise your hands please . ( Laughter ) Okay . You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value . ( Laughter ) The rest of you won &apos;t find my talk personally relevant , but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to talk about growing older in traditional societies .
__bs__ This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book , which compares traditional , small , tribal societies with our large , modern societies , with respect to many topics such as bringing up children , growing older , health , dealing with danger , settling disputes , religion and speaking more than one language .
__bs__ Those tribal societies , which constituted all human societies for most of human history , are far more diverse than are our modern , recent , big societies .
__bs__ All big societies that have governments , and where most people are strangers to each other , are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies .
__bs__ Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society .
__bs__ They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn .
__bs__ Tribal societies shouldn &apos;t be scorned as primitive and miserable , but also they shouldn &apos;t be romanticized as happy and peaceful .
__bs__ When we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves .
__bs__ Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends .
__bs__ Nevertheless , the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies , from much worse to much better than in our modern societies .
__bs__ At the worst extreme , many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways : by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die , or by abandoning them when the group moves , or by encouraging older people to commit suicide , or by killing older people .
__bs__ In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
__bs__ It happens mainly under two conditions .
__bs__ One is in nomadic , hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can &apos;t walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions .
__bs__ The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments , such as the Arctic or deserts , where there are periodic food shortages , and occasionally there just isn &apos;t enough food to keep everyone alive .
__bs__ Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able-bodied adults and for children .
__bs__ To us Americans , it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father , but what could those traditional societies do differently ?
__bs__ They face a cruel situation of no choice .
__bs__ Their old people had to do it to their own parents , and the old people know what now is going to happen to them .
__bs__ At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly , the happy extreme , are the New Guinea farming societies where I &apos;ve been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years , and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world .
__bs__ In those societies , older people are cared for .
__bs__ They are fed . They remain valuable .
__bs__ And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children , relatives and lifelong friends .
__bs__ There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people .
__bs__ The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society &apos;s values .
__bs__ First , as regards usefulness , older people continue to perform useful services .
__bs__ One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food .
__bs__ Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren .
__bs__ Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools , weapons , baskets , pots and textiles .
__bs__ In fact , they &apos;re usually the people who are best at it .
__bs__ Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances .
__bs__ Finally , older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern , literate societies , where our sources of information are books and the Internet .
__bs__ In contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
__bs__ It &apos;s their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience .
__bs__ Those , then , are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies .
__bs__ Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society &apos;s treatment of the elderly .
__bs__ The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society &apos;s cultural values .
__bs__ For example , there &apos;s particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia , associated with Confucius &apos; doctrine of filial piety , which means obedience , respect and support for elderly parents .
__bs__ Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S.
__bs__ Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
__bs__ They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
__bs__ Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources .
__bs__ That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited , for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant , or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients , American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them , even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them .
__bs__ There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S.
__bs__ One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work , so older people who are no longer working aren &apos;t respected .
__bs__ Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
__bs__ Still a third reason is our American cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements .
__bs__ Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people , even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer .
__bs__ Just think , what &apos;s the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old ? Never .
__bs__ Instead , the only American ads featuring white-haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning .
__bs__ Well , what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies ?
__bs__ There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse .
__bs__ Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives , much better health in our old age , and much better recreational opportunities .
__bs__ Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people .
__bs__ Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past .
__bs__ That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people , and that each old person has less individual value .
__bs__ Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age , because older people , their children , and their friends , all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives .
__bs__ We Americans move on the average every five years .
__bs__ Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth .
__bs__ Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce , carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work .
__bs__ Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies .
__bs__ Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge .
__bs__ When we want some information , we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask .
__bs__ The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old , but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later .
__bs__ And conversely , we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society .
__bs__ For example , as a 15-year-old , I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I &apos;m quick at manipulating a slide rule .
__bs__ Today , though , those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator .
__bs__ Conversely , I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
__bs__ My family &apos;s first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered : an on-off switch , a volume knob , and a channel selector knob .
__bs__ Today , just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house , I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me .
__bs__ I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons .
__bs__ What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S. , and to make better use of their value ?
__bs__ That &apos;s a huge problem .
__bs__ In my remaining four minutes today , I can offer just a few suggestions .
__bs__ One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
__bs__ Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers , grandparents offer superior , motivated , experienced child care .
__bs__ They &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
__bs__ They usually love their grandchildren , and are eager to spend time with them .
__bs__ Unlike other caregivers , grandparents don &apos;t quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby .
__bs__ A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology .
__bs__ At the same time , older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change , but that could come back .
__bs__ For example , only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs .
__bs__ Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older Americans do .
__bs__ Unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
__bs__ Even if they don &apos;t come back , we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like .
__bs__ Older people have that experience .
__bs__ Younger people don &apos;t .
__bs__ The remaining value of older people that I &apos;ll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do , there are other things that they can do better than younger people .
__bs__ A challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing .
__bs__ Some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
__bs__ Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina , ambition , and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation , such as figuring out the structure of DNA , best left to scientists under the age of 30 .
__bs__ Conversely , valuable attributes that increase with age include experience , understanding of people and human relationships , ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way , and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases , such as economics and comparative history , best left to scholars over the age of 60 .
__bs__ Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising , administering , advising , strategizing , teaching , synthesizing , and devising long-term plans .
__bs__ I &apos;ve seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s , 70s , 80s and 90s , who are still active as investment managers , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
__bs__ In short , many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern , big societies .
__bs__ Paradoxically nowadays , when we have more elderly people than ever before , living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before , old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before .
__bs__ The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society .
__bs__ We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies .
__bs__ But what &apos;s true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well .
__bs__ Of course , I &apos;m not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle .
__bs__ There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small , traditional societies .
__bs__ To mention just a few examples , our lives are longer , materially much richer , and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies .
__bs__ But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies , and perhaps to be learned from them .
__bs__ Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives , although materially poorer .
__bs__ Their children are more self-confident , more independent , and more socially skilled than are our children .
__bs__ They think more realistically about dangers than we do .
__bs__ They almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today .
__bs__ Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases , and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them .
__bs__ Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
__bs__ I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies .
__bs__ Thank you .

__bs__ Erez Lieberman Aiden : Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words .
__bs__ But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So we assembled a team of experts , spanning Harvard , MIT , The American Heritage Dictionary , The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors , the Google .
__bs__ And we cogitated about this for about four years .
__bs__ And we came to a startling conclusion .
__bs__ Ladies and gentlemen , a picture is not worth a thousand words .
__bs__ In fact , we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
__bs__ Jean-Baptiste Michel : So how did we get to this conclusion ?
__bs__ So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history : change over time .
__bs__ So many books actually have been written over the years .
__bs__ So we were thinking , well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .
__bs__ Now of course , if there &apos;s a scale for how awesome that is , that has to rank extremely , extremely high .
__bs__ Now the problem is there &apos;s an X-axis for that , which is the practical axis .
__bs__ This is very , very low .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Now people tend to use an alternative approach , which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully .
__bs__ This is extremely practical , but not so awesome .
__bs__ What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space .
__bs__ So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach .
__bs__ They have digitized millions of books .
__bs__ So what that means is , one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button .
__bs__ That &apos;s very practical and extremely awesome .
__bs__ ELA : Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from .
__bs__ Since time immemorial , there have been authors .
__bs__ These authors have been striving to write books .
__bs__ And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago .
__bs__ Since then , the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions , publishing books .
__bs__ Now if those books are not lost to history , then they are somewhere in a library , and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google , which has scanned 15 million books to date .
__bs__ Now when Google digitizes a book , they put it into a really nice format .
__bs__ Now we &apos;ve got the data , plus we have metadata .
__bs__ We have information about things like where was it published , who was the author , when was it published .
__bs__ And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that &apos;s not the highest quality data .
__bs__ What we &apos;re left with is a collection of five million books , 500 billion words , a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome — a text which , when written out , would stretch from here to the Moon and back 10 times over — a veritable shard of our cultural genome .
__bs__ Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ...
__bs__ ( Laughter ) was what any self-respecting researchers would have done .
__bs__ We took a page out of XKCD , and we said , &quot; &quot; Stand back .
__bs__ We &apos;re going to try science . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) JM : Now of course , we were thinking , well let &apos;s just first put the data out there for people to do science to it .
__bs__ Now we &apos;re thinking , what data can we release ?
__bs__ Well of course , you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books .
__bs__ Now Google , and Jon Orwant in particular , told us a little equation that we should learn .
__bs__ So you have five million , that is , five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit .
__bs__ So , although that would be really , really awesome , again , that &apos;s extremely , extremely impractical .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
__bs__ We said , well instead of releasing the full text , we &apos;re going to release statistics about the books .
__bs__ So take for instance &quot; &quot; A gleam of happiness . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s four words ; we call that a four-gram .
__bs__ We &apos;re going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram appeared in books in 1801 , 1802 , 1803 , all the way up to 2008 .
__bs__ That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time .
__bs__ We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books , and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing .
__bs__ ELA : So those two billion lines , we call them two billion n-grams .
__bs__ What do they tell us ?
__bs__ Well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends .
__bs__ Let me give you an example .
__bs__ Let &apos;s suppose that I am thriving , then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did .
__bs__ And so I might say , &quot; &quot; Yesterday , I throve . &quot; &quot; Alternatively , I could say , &quot; &quot; Yesterday , I thrived . &quot; &quot; Well which one should I use ?
__bs__ How to know ?
__bs__ As of about six months ago , the state of the art in this field is that you would , for instance , go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair , and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Steve , you &apos;re an expert on the irregular verbs .
__bs__ What should I do ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;d tell you , &quot; &quot; Well most people say thrived , but some people say throve . &quot; &quot; And you also knew , more or less , that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair , ( Laughter ) &quot; Tom , what should I say ? &quot;
__bs__ He &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Well , in my day , most people throve , but some thrived . &quot; &quot; So now what I &apos;m just going to show you is raw data .
__bs__ Two rows from this table of two billion entries .
__bs__ What you &apos;re seeing is year by year frequency of &quot; &quot; thrived &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; throve &quot; &quot; over time .
__bs__ Now this is just two out of two billion rows .
__bs__ So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) JM : Now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
__bs__ For instance , this one .
__bs__ If you just take influenza , you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe .
__bs__ ELA : If you were not yet convinced , sea levels are rising , so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature .
__bs__ JM : You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram , and that &apos;s to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead , although you might agree that he might need a better publicist .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ELA : You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing .
__bs__ For instance , let me tell you the history of the year 1950 .
__bs__ Pretty much for the vast majority of history , no one gave a damn about 1950 .
__bs__ In 1700 , in 1800 , in 1900 , no one cared .
__bs__ Through the 30s and 40s , no one cared .
__bs__ Suddenly , in the mid-40s , there started to be a buzz .
__bs__ People realized that 1950 was going to happen , and it could be big .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 . ( Laughter )
__bs__ People were walking around obsessed .
__bs__ They couldn &apos;t stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 , all the things they were planning to do in 1950 , all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 .
__bs__ In fact , 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter , people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened , in &apos; 51 , &apos; 52 , &apos; 53 .
__bs__ Finally in 1954 , someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And just like that , the bubble burst . ( Laughter )
__bs__ And the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record , with a little twist , because now we &apos;ve got these nice charts .
__bs__ And because we have these nice charts , we can measure things .
__bs__ We can say , &quot; &quot; Well how fast does the bubble burst ? &quot; &quot; And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely .
__bs__ Equations were derived , graphs were produced , and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year .
__bs__ We are losing interest in the past more rapidly .
__bs__ JM : Now a little piece of career advice .
__bs__ So for those of you who seek to be famous , we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures , authors , actors and so on .
__bs__ So if you want to become famous early on , you should be an actor , because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s — you &apos;re still young , it &apos;s really great .
__bs__ Now if you can wait a little bit , you should be an author , because then you rise to very great heights , like Mark Twain , for instance : extremely famous .
__bs__ But if you want to reach the very top , you should delay gratification and , of course , become a politician .
__bs__ So here you will become famous by the end of your 50s , and become very , very famous afterward .
__bs__ So scientists also tend to get famous when they &apos;re much older .
__bs__ Like for instance , biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors .
__bs__ One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) If you do that , you might think , &quot; &quot; Oh great . I &apos;m going to do my best work when I &apos;m in my 20s . &quot; &quot; But guess what , nobody will really care . ( Laughter )
__bs__ ELA : There are more sobering notes among the n-grams .
__bs__ For instance , here &apos;s the trajectory of Marc Chagall , an artist born in 1887 .
__bs__ And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
__bs__ He gets more and more and more famous , except if you look in German .
__bs__ If you look in German , you see something completely bizarre , something you pretty much never see , which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets , going through a nadir between 1933 and 1945 , before rebounding afterward .
__bs__ And of course , what we &apos;re seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany .
__bs__ Now these signals are actually so strong that we don &apos;t need to know that someone was censored .
__bs__ We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing .
__bs__ Here &apos;s a simple way to do it .
__bs__ Well , a reasonable expectation is that somebody &apos;s fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after .
__bs__ So that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
__bs__ And we compare that to the fame that we observe .
__bs__ And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index .
__bs__ If the suppression index is very , very , very small , then you very well might be being suppressed .
__bs__ If it &apos;s very large , maybe you &apos;re benefiting from propaganda .
__bs__ JM : Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations .
__bs__ So for instance , here — this suppression index is for 5,000 people picked in English books where there &apos;s no known suppression — it would be like this , basically tightly centered on one .
__bs__ What you expect is basically what you observe .
__bs__ This is distribution as seen in Germany — very different , it &apos;s shifted to the left .
__bs__ People talked about it twice less as it should have been .
__bs__ But much more importantly , the distribution is much wider .
__bs__ There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been .
__bs__ But then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda .
__bs__ This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record .
__bs__ ELA : So culturomics is what we call this method .
__bs__ It &apos;s kind of like genomics .
__bs__ Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome .
__bs__ Culturomics is similar .
__bs__ It &apos;s the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .
__bs__ Here , instead of through the lens of a genome , through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record .
__bs__ The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it .
__bs__ Why can everyone do it ?
__bs__ Everyone can do it because three guys , Jon Orwant , Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google , saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer , and they said , &quot; &quot; This is so fun .
__bs__ We have to make this available for people . &quot; &quot; So in two weeks flat — the two weeks before our paper came out — they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public .
__bs__ And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you &apos;re interested in and see its n-gram immediately — also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears .
__bs__ JM : Now this was used over a million times on the first day , and this is really the best of all the queries .
__bs__ So people want to be their best , put their best foot forward .
__bs__ But it turns out in the 18th century , people didn &apos;t really care about that at all .
__bs__ They didn &apos;t want to be their best , they wanted to be their beft .
__bs__ So what happened is , of course , this is just a mistake .
__bs__ It &apos;s not that strove for mediocrity , it &apos;s just that the S used to be written differently , kind of like an F.
__bs__ Now of course , Google didn &apos;t pick this up at the time , so we reported this in the science article that we wrote .
__bs__ But it turns out this is just a reminder that , although this is a lot of fun , when you interpret these graphs , you have to be very careful , and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences .
__bs__ ELA : People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Actually , we &apos;re not going to have to talk , we &apos;re just going to show you all the slides and remain silent .
__bs__ This person was interested in the history of frustration .
__bs__ There &apos;s various types of frustration .
__bs__ If you stub your toe , that &apos;s a one A &quot; &quot; argh . &quot; &quot; If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass , that &apos;s an eight A &quot; &quot; aaaaaaaargh . &quot; &quot; This person studies all the &quot; &quot; arghs , &quot; &quot; from one through eight A &apos;s .
__bs__ And it turns out that the less-frequent &quot; &quot; arghs &quot; &quot; are , of course , the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating — except , oddly , in the early 80s .
__bs__ We think that might have something to do with Reagan .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) JM : There are many usages of this data , but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized .
__bs__ Google has started to digitize 15 million books .
__bs__ That &apos;s 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published .
__bs__ It &apos;s a sizable chunk of human culture .
__bs__ There &apos;s much more in culture : there &apos;s manuscripts , there newspapers , there &apos;s things that are not text , like art and paintings .
__bs__ These all happen to be on our computers , on computers across the world .
__bs__ And when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ What do you call the leader of a republican country ?
__bs__ We have a global health challenge in our hands today , and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly , takes far too long , and it fails more often than it succeeds .
__bs__ It really just isn &apos;t working , and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them , and diseases are going untreated .
__bs__ We seem to be spending more and more money .
__bs__ So for every billion dollars we spend in R &amp; D , we &apos;re getting less drugs approved into the market .
__bs__ More money , less drugs . Hmm .
__bs__ So what &apos;s going on here ?
__bs__ Well , there &apos;s a multitude of factors at play , but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work , whether it has efficacy , or whether it &apos;s going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials , are failing us . They &apos;re not predicting what &apos;s going to happen in humans .
__bs__ And we have two main tools available at our disposal .
__bs__ They are cells in dishes and animal testing .
__bs__ Now let &apos;s talk about the first one , cells in dishes .
__bs__ So , cells are happily functioning in our bodies .
__bs__ We take them and rip them out of their native environment , throw them in one of these dishes , and expect them to work .
__bs__ Guess what . They don &apos;t .
__bs__ They don &apos;t like that environment because it &apos;s nothing like what they have in the body .
__bs__ What about animal testing ?
__bs__ Well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
__bs__ They teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
__bs__ We learn more about the biology itself .
__bs__ However , more often than not , animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they &apos;re treated with a particular drug .
__bs__ So we need better tools .
__bs__ We need human cells , but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body .
__bs__ Our bodies are dynamic environments .
__bs__ We &apos;re in constant motion .
__bs__ Our cells experience that .
__bs__ They &apos;re in dynamic environments in our body .
__bs__ They &apos;re under constant mechanical forces .
__bs__ So if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies , we need to become cell architects .
__bs__ We need to design , build and engineer a home away from home for the cells .
__bs__ And at the Wyss Institute , we &apos;ve done just that .
__bs__ We call it an organ-on-a-chip .
__bs__ And I have one right here .
__bs__ It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ? But it &apos;s pretty incredible .
__bs__ Right here in my hand is a breathing , living human lung on a chip .
__bs__ And it &apos;s not just beautiful .
__bs__ It can do a tremendous amount of things .
__bs__ We have living cells in that little chip , cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types .
__bs__ There &apos;s been many people trying to grow cells in the lab .
__bs__ They &apos;ve tried many different approaches .
__bs__ They &apos;ve even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab .
__bs__ We &apos;re not trying to do that here .
__bs__ We &apos;re simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry , the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies .
__bs__ So how does it work ? Let me show you .
__bs__ We use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment .
__bs__ We have three fluidic channels .
__bs__ In the center , we have a porous , flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from , say , our lungs , and then underneath , they had capillary cells , the cells in our blood vessels .
__bs__ And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane , so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe .
__bs__ And they experience them how they did in the body .
__bs__ There &apos;s air flowing through the top channel , and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel .
__bs__ Now the chip is really beautiful , but what can we do with it ?
__bs__ We can get incredible functionality inside these little chips .
__bs__ Let me show you .
__bs__ We could , for example , mimic infection , where we add bacterial cells into the lung .
__bs__ then we can add human white blood cells .
__bs__ White blood cells are our body &apos;s defense against bacterial invaders , and when they sense this inflammation due to infection , they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria .
__bs__ Well now you &apos;re going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip .
__bs__ We &apos;ve labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through , and when they detect that infection , they begin to stick .
__bs__ They stick , and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel .
__bs__ And you can see here , we can actually visualize a single white blood cell .
__bs__ It sticks , it wiggles its way through between the cell layers , through the pore , comes out on the other side of the membrane , and right there , it &apos;s going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green .
__bs__ In that tiny chip , you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection .
__bs__ It &apos;s the way we respond to — an immune response .
__bs__ It &apos;s pretty exciting .
__bs__ Now I want to share this picture with you , not just because it &apos;s so beautiful , but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips .
__bs__ It tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs , actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung .
__bs__ These structures are called cilia , and they actually move the mucus out of the lung .
__bs__ Yeah . Mucus . Yuck .
__bs__ But mucus is actually very important .
__bs__ Mucus traps particulates , viruses , potential allergens , and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out .
__bs__ When they get damaged , say , by cigarette smoke for example , they don &apos;t work properly , and they can &apos;t clear that mucus out .
__bs__ And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis .
__bs__ Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis .
__bs__ But now , with the functionality that we get in these chips , we can begin to look for potential new treatments .
__bs__ We didn &apos;t stop with the lung on a chip .
__bs__ We have a gut on a chip .
__bs__ You can see one right here .
__bs__ And we &apos;ve put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip , and they &apos;re under constant peristaltic motion , this trickling flow through the cells , and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine .
__bs__ Now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome .
__bs__ This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals .
__bs__ It &apos;s really debilitating , and there aren &apos;t really many good treatments for it .
__bs__ Now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs .
__bs__ Now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them .
__bs__ There &apos;s fluid flowing across these cells , so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip .
__bs__ Now we &apos;re really getting excited .
__bs__ We &apos;re not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips , but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what &apos;s going to happen in humans .
__bs__ For example , now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug .
__bs__ Those of you like me who have asthma , when you take your inhaler , we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs , how it enters the body , how it might affect , say , your heart .
__bs__ Does it change the beating of your heart ?
__bs__ Does it have a toxicity ?
__bs__ Does it get cleared by the liver ?
__bs__ Is it metabolized in the liver ?
__bs__ Is it excreted in your kidneys ?
__bs__ We can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug .
__bs__ This could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry , but a whole host of different industries , including the cosmetics industry .
__bs__ We can potentially use the skin on a chip that we &apos;re currently developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you &apos;re using are actually safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing .
__bs__ We could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
__bs__ We could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure .
__bs__ We could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as SARS .
__bs__ Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future .
__bs__ Right now , the average participant in a clinical trial is that : average .
__bs__ Tends to be middle aged , tends to be female .
__bs__ You won &apos;t find many clinical trials in which children are involved , yet every day , we give children medications , and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults .
__bs__ Children are not adults .
__bs__ They may not respond in the same way adults do .
__bs__ There are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at-risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction .
__bs__ Now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations , put them on chips , and create populations on a chip .
__bs__ This could really change the way we do clinical trials .
__bs__ And this is the team and the people that are doing this .
__bs__ We have engineers , we have cell biologists , we have clinicians , all working together .
__bs__ We &apos;re really seeing something quite incredible at the Wyss Institute .
__bs__ It &apos;s really a convergence of disciplines , where biology is influencing the way we design , the way we engineer , the way we build .
__bs__ It &apos;s pretty exciting .
__bs__ We &apos;re establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing .
__bs__ They &apos;re going to help us make , instead of one of these , millions of these chips , so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible .
__bs__ And this is key to the potential of that technology .
__bs__ Now let me show you our instrument .
__bs__ This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab , and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we &apos;re going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together .
__bs__ It does something else that &apos;s very important .
__bs__ It creates an easy user interface .
__bs__ So a cell biologist like me can come in , take a chip , put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there , put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D. , and away you go .
__bs__ Plug and play . Easy .
__bs__ Now , let &apos;s imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip , or your stem cells and put them on a chip .
__bs__ It would be a personalized chip just for you .
__bs__ Now all of us in here are individuals , and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs .
__bs__ I myself , a couple of years back , had a really bad headache , just couldn &apos;t shake it , thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll try something different . &quot; &quot; I took some Advil . Fifteen minutes later , I was on my way to the emergency room with a full-blown asthma attack .
__bs__ Now , obviously it wasn &apos;t fatal , but unfortunately , some of these adverse drug reactions can be fatal .
__bs__ So how do we prevent them ?
__bs__ Well , we could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip , having Danielle on a chip , having you on a chip .
__bs__ Personalized medicine . Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ What &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
__bs__ And why did you do it ?
__bs__ I know what the most dangerous thing is that I &apos;ve ever done because NASA does the math .
__bs__ You go into , at the Kennedy Space Center , the suit-up room , the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in , that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon .
__bs__ The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed , almost holding hands , looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger .
__bs__ We ride the elevator up and we crawl in , on your hands and knees into the spaceship , one at a time , and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back .
__bs__ In the astronaut business — the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle ; it &apos;s the most complicated flying machine ever built .
__bs__ And in the astronaut business , we have a saying , which is , there is no problem so bad that you can &apos;t make it worse .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And so you &apos;re very conscious in the cockpit ; you &apos;re thinking about all of the things that you might have to do , all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through .
__bs__ And as the time gets closer and closer , this excitement is building .
__bs__ ( Space shuttle taking off ) Chris Hadfield : It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things .
__bs__ You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself .
__bs__ It &apos;s shaking you so hard you can &apos;t focus on the instruments in front of you .
__bs__ After two minutes , those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines , the hydrogen and oxygen , and it &apos;s as if you &apos;re in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you &apos;ve never accelerated .
__bs__ It feels like someone &apos;s pouring cement on you or something .
__bs__ Until finally , after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so , we are finally at exactly the right altitude , exactly the right speed , the right direction , the engine shut off , and we &apos;re weightless .
__bs__ And we &apos;re alive .
__bs__ It &apos;s an amazing experience .
__bs__ But why would we take that risk ?
__bs__ Why would you do something that dangerous ?
__bs__ In my case the answer is fairly straightforward .
__bs__ I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do .
__bs__ But the real question is , how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it ?
__bs__ How do you deal with fear versus danger ?
__bs__ And you see , because of the speed , a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year .
__bs__ And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk .
__bs__ It &apos;s an entirely different perspective , you &apos;re not looking up at the universe , you and the Earth are going through the universe together .
__bs__ And you &apos;re holding on with one hand , looking at the world turn beside you .
__bs__ It &apos;s roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you .
__bs__ And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything , it &apos;s unfathomable blackness , with a texture you feel like you could stick your hand into .
__bs__ and you are holding on with one hand , one link to the other seven billion people .
__bs__ Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn &apos;t figure out why my eye wasn &apos;t working .
__bs__ I was thinking , what do I do next ?
__bs__ So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually , the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes &quot; &quot; goosh &quot; &quot; into your other eye , and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship .
__bs__ So what &apos;s the scariest thing you &apos;ve ever done ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Maybe it &apos;s spiders .
__bs__ A lot of people are afraid of spiders .
__bs__ And how do you know ?
__bs__ And so a spider lands on you , and you go through this great , spasmy attack because spiders are scary .
__bs__ But then you could say , well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not ?
__bs__ And if you &apos;re in Canada , because of the cold winters here in B.C. , there &apos;s about 720 , 730 different types of spiders and there &apos;s one — one — that is venomous , and its venom isn &apos;t even fatal , it &apos;s just kind of like a nasty sting .
__bs__ The danger is entirely different than the fear .
__bs__ How do you get around it , though ?
__bs__ How do you change your behavior ?
__bs__ It &apos;s just a little bit of fluffy stuff . It &apos;s not a big deal .
__bs__ And the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly .
__bs__ And you can apply this to anything .
__bs__ If you &apos;re outside on a spacewalk and you &apos;re blinded , your natural reaction would be to panic , I think .
__bs__ It would make you nervous and worried .
__bs__ But we had considered all the venom , and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs .
__bs__ We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times .
__bs__ And not just underwater , but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it &apos;s realistic .
__bs__ So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk , it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time .
__bs__ And even if you &apos;re blinded , your natural , panicky reaction doesn &apos;t happen .
__bs__ I could find my own way back .
__bs__ It &apos;s not nearly as big a deal .
__bs__ We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside , Jeff got some cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes , and it turned out it was just the anti-fog , sort of a mixture of oil and soap , that got in my eye .
__bs__ What is the real thing that you should be afraid of ?
__bs__ You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge , just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear .
__bs__ You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened .
__bs__ It &apos;s time to come home at the end .
__bs__ Three of us climb in , and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere .
__bs__ These two parts here actually melt , we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere .
__bs__ The only part that survives is the little bullet that we &apos;re riding in , and it falls into the atmosphere , and in essence you are riding a meteorite home , and riding meteorites is scary , and it ought to be .
__bs__ So in fact , when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz , we weren &apos;t screaming , we were laughing ; it was fun .
__bs__ So we came back , we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz , in Kazakhstan .
__bs__ Touchdown — 3 : 14 and 48 seconds , a.m. Central Time .
__bs__ And then eventually the Russians reach in , drag you out , plunk you into a chair , and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience .
__bs__ You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy , which were impossible and dauntingly scary , dauntingly terrifying , and put them into practice , and figured out a way to reprogram yourself , to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise .
__bs__ Just to finish , they asked me to play that guitar .
__bs__ I know this song , and it &apos;s really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself , but it &apos;s also , I think , a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe , we are people , and we &apos;re taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place .
__bs__ ( Music ) ♫ This is Major Tom to ground control ♫ ♫ I &apos;ve left forevermore ♫ ♫ And I &apos;m floating in a most peculiar way ♫ ♫ And the stars look very different today ♫ ♫ For here am I floating in the tin can ♫ ♫ A last glimpse of the world ♫ ♫ Planet Earth is blue and there &apos;s so much left to do ♫ ( Music ) Fear not .

__bs__ It takes guts to stand out like that .

__bs__ Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
__bs__ And what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Anyone ?
__bs__ How about a moderate amount of stress ?
__bs__ Yeah . Me too .
__bs__ But that is not my confession .
__bs__ It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
__bs__ But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change yours .
__bs__ Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress .
__bs__ When you change your mind about stress , you can change your body &apos;s response to stress .
__bs__ It &apos;s called the social stress test .
__bs__ And unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it .
__bs__ That guy made a mistake .
__bs__ And normally , we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren &apos;t coping very well with the pressure .
__bs__ It &apos;s getting more oxygen to your brain .
__bs__ And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance , well , they were less stressed out , less anxious , more confident , but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed .
__bs__ It &apos;s not really healthy to be in this state all the time .
__bs__ It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage .
__bs__ I no longer want to get rid of your stress .
__bs__ I want to make you better at stress .
__bs__ And we just did a little intervention .
__bs__ Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from , so we are going to do one more intervention .
__bs__ It even has its own cute nickname , the cuddle hormone , because it &apos;s released when you hug someone .
__bs__ But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in .
__bs__ It fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
__bs__ Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family .
__bs__ It enhances your empathy .
__bs__ It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
__bs__ But here &apos;s what most people don &apos;t understand about oxytocin .
__bs__ It &apos;s a stress hormone .
__bs__ Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response .
__bs__ It &apos;s as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound .
__bs__ Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other .
__bs__ Okay , so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier ?
__bs__ It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
__bs__ It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress .
__bs__ But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart .
__bs__ So when you reach out to others under stress , either to seek support or to help someone else , you release more of this hormone , your stress response becomes healthier , and you actually recover faster from stress .
__bs__ Okay , so the bad news first : For every major stressful life experience , like financial difficulties or family crisis , that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent .
__bs__ People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying .
__bs__ Stress gives us access to our hearts .
__bs__ And when you choose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty profound statement .
__bs__ You &apos;re saying that you can trust yourself to handle life &apos;s challenges .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : This is kind of amazing , what you &apos;re telling us .
__bs__ Metaphor lives a secret life all around us .
__bs__ We utter about six metaphors a minute .
__bs__ Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others , how we communicate , learn , discover and invent .
__bs__ But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words .
__bs__ Now , to assist me in explaining this , I &apos;ve enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers , the reigning king of the metaphorians , a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor .
__bs__ I am , of course , referring to none other than Elvis Presley .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Now , &quot; &quot; All Shook Up &quot; &quot; is a great love song .
__bs__ It &apos;s also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract — ideas , emotions , feelings , concepts , thoughts — we inevitably resort to metaphor .
__bs__ In &quot; &quot; All Shook Up , &quot; &quot; a touch is not a touch , but a chill .
__bs__ Lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
__bs__ She is not she , but a buttercup .
__bs__ And love is not love , but being all shook up .
__bs__ In this , Elvis is following Aristotle &apos;s classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else .
__bs__ This is the mathematics of metaphor .
__bs__ And fortunately it &apos;s very simple .
__bs__ X equals Y.
__bs__ ( Laughter ) This formula works wherever metaphor is present .
__bs__ Elvis uses it , but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from &quot; &quot; Romeo and Juliet : &quot; &quot; Juliet is the sun .
__bs__ Now , here , Shakespeare gives the thing , Juliet , a name that belongs to something else , the sun .
__bs__ But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else , we give it a whole network of analogies too .
__bs__ We mix and match what we know about the metaphor &apos;s source , in this case the sun , with what we know about its target , Juliet .
__bs__ And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like .
__bs__ So , how do we make and understand metaphors ?
__bs__ This might look familiar .
__bs__ The first step is pattern recognition .
__bs__ Look at this image . What do you see ?
__bs__ Three wayward Pac-Men , and three pointy brackets are actually present .
__bs__ What we see , however , are two overlapping triangles .
__bs__ Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns ; it is the creation of patterns .
__bs__ Second step , conceptual synesthesia .
__bs__ Now , synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well , such as colored hearing .
__bs__ People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters .
__bs__ We all have synesthetic abilities .
__bs__ This is the Bouba / Kiki test .
__bs__ What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba , and which is called Kiki .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) If you are like 98 percent of other people , you will identify the round , amoeboid shape as Bouba , and the sharp , spiky one as Kiki .
__bs__ Can we do a quick show of hands ?
__bs__ Does that correspond ?
__bs__ Okay , I think 99.9 would about cover it .
__bs__ Why do we do that ?
__bs__ Because we instinctively find , or create , a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba , and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki .
__bs__ And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic .
__bs__ Silence is sweet .
__bs__ Neckties are loud .
__bs__ Sexually attractive people are hot .
__bs__ Sexually unattractive people leave us cold .
__bs__ Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia , in which we understand one concept in the context of another .
__bs__ Third step is cognitive dissonance .
__bs__ This is the Stroop test .
__bs__ What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed .
__bs__ You can take the test now .
__bs__ If you &apos;re like most people , you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink .
__bs__ The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer .
__bs__ Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well .
__bs__ The participants had to identify , as quickly as possible , the literally false sentences .
__bs__ They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences .
__bs__ Why ? Because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either .
__bs__ One of the sentences was , &quot; &quot; Some jobs are jails . &quot; &quot; Now , unless you &apos;re a prison guard , the sentence &quot; &quot; Some jobs are jails &quot; &quot; is literally false .
__bs__ Sadly , it &apos;s metaphorically true .
__bs__ And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false .
__bs__ Metaphor matters because it &apos;s around us every day , all the time .
__bs__ Metaphor matters because it creates expectations .
__bs__ Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news .
__bs__ Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing , as in , &quot; &quot; The NASDAQ climbed higher . &quot; &quot; Object metaphors describe price movements as non-living things , as in , &quot; &quot; The Dow fell like a brick . &quot; &quot; Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries , and then predict the next day &apos;s price trend .
__bs__ Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue .
__bs__ And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .
__bs__ If , for example , house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing , higher and higher , people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable .
__bs__ They may feel confident , say , in taking out mortgages they really can &apos;t afford .
__bs__ That &apos;s a hypothetical example of course .
__bs__ But this is how metaphor misleads .
__bs__ Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies .
__bs__ A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help .
__bs__ And they had to make a decision .
__bs__ What should they do ?
__bs__ Intervene , appeal to the U.N. , or do nothing ?
__bs__ They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis .
__bs__ Each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy : World War II , Vietnam , and the third was historically neutral .
__bs__ Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others .
__bs__ Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words , we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor .
__bs__ Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery .
__bs__ Whenever we solve a problem , or make a discovery , we compare what we know with what we don &apos;t know .
__bs__ And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former .
__bs__ Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play .
__bs__ He famously used thought experiments , which are essentially elaborate analogies , to come up with some of his greatest discoveries .
__bs__ By bringing together what we know and what we don &apos;t know through analogy , metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery .
__bs__ Now metaphor is ubiquitous , yet it &apos;s hidden .
__bs__ But you just have to look at the words around you and you &apos;ll find it .
__bs__ Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as &quot; &quot; fossil poetry . &quot; &quot; But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor .
__bs__ And these fossils still breathe .
__bs__ Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy : &quot; Cogito ergo sum . &quot;
__bs__ That &apos;s routinely translated as , &quot; &quot; I think , therefore I am . &quot; &quot; But there is a better translation .
__bs__ The Latin word &quot; &quot; cogito &quot; &quot; is derived from the prefix &quot; &quot; co , &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; together , &quot; &quot; and the verb &quot; &quot; agitare , &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; to shake . &quot; &quot; So , the original meaning of &quot; &quot; cogito &quot; &quot; is to shake together .
__bs__ And the proper translation of &quot; &quot; cogito ergo sum &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; I shake things up , therefore I am . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Metaphor shakes things up , giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process .
__bs__ The mind is a plastic snow dome , the most beautiful , most interesting , and most itself , when , as Elvis put it , it &apos;s all shook up .
__bs__ And metaphor keeps the mind shaking , rattling and rolling , long after Elvis has left the building .
__bs__ Thank you very much .

__bs__ Hannah is excited to be going to college .
__bs__ She couldn &apos;t wait to get out of her parents &apos; house , to prove to them that she &apos;s an adult , and to prove to her new friends that she belongs .
__bs__ She heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on .
__bs__ Let &apos;s call him Mike .
__bs__ The next day , Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache .
__bs__ She can only remember the night in flashes .
__bs__ But what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside Mike &apos;s room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her , wanting it to stop , then shakily stumbling home .
__bs__ She doesn &apos;t feel good about what happened , but she thinks , &quot; &quot; Maybe this is just what sex in college is ? &quot; &quot; One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the United States .
__bs__ Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school or to the police .
__bs__ And those who do , on average , wait 11 months to make the report .
__bs__ Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own .
__bs__ But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties , she &apos;s worried about them .
__bs__ After graduation , Hannah learns that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to .
__bs__ And this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders .
__bs__ But with such low reporting rates , it &apos;s fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported , much less anything happen if they are .
__bs__ In fact , only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison .
__bs__ Meaning , there &apos;s a 99 percent chance that they &apos;ll get away with it .
__bs__ This means there &apos;s practically no deterrent to assault in the United States .
__bs__ Now , I &apos;m an infectious disease epidemiologist by training .
__bs__ I &apos;m interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good .
__bs__ So this , to me , is a tragic but a solvable problem .
__bs__ So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago , it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change .
__bs__ And so we did .
__bs__ We started by talking to college survivors .
__bs__ And what they wish they &apos;d had in college is pretty simple ; they wanted a website , one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them with clearly written information about their reporting options , with the ability to electronically report their assault , rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them .
__bs__ With the option to create a secure , timestamped document of what happened to them , preserving evidence even if they don &apos;t want to report yet .
__bs__ And lastly , and perhaps most critically , with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant .
__bs__ You see , knowing that you weren &apos;t the only one changes everything .
__bs__ It changes the way you frame your own experience , it changes the way you think about your perpetrator , it means that if you do come forward , you &apos;ll have someone else &apos;s back and they &apos;ll have yours .
__bs__ We created a website that actually does this and we launched it &#91; ... &#93; in August , on two college campuses .
__bs__ And we included a unique matching system where if Mike &apos;s first victim had come forward , saved her record , entered into the matching system and named Mike , and Mike &apos;s second victim had done the same thing a few months later , they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time for investigation and follow up .
__bs__ If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers , it &apos;s more likely that they would have reported , that they would have been believed , and that Mike would have been kicked off campus , gone to jail , or at least gotten the help that he needed .
__bs__ And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match , survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place .
__bs__ We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on .
__bs__ And because we &apos;re creating a real deterrent to assault , for perhaps the first time , maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone .
__bs__ The type of system I &apos;m describing , the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow , meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met , such as a match .
__bs__ The application that we built is for college campuses .
__bs__ But the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace .
__bs__ We don &apos;t have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it .
__bs__ We can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable , where survivors get the support and justice they deserve , where the authorities get the information they need , and where there &apos;s a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being .
__bs__ Thank you .

__bs__ Let me tell you a story about a little girl named Naghma .
__bs__ Naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters .
__bs__ Every morning , her father would wake up in the hopes he &apos;d be picked for construction work , and on a good month he would earn 50 dollars .
__bs__ The winter was very harsh , and unfortunately , Naghma &apos;s brother died and her mother became very ill .
__bs__ In desperation , her father went to a neighbor to borrow 2,500 dollars .
__bs__ After several months of waiting , the neighbor became very impatient , and he demanded that he be paid back .
__bs__ Unfortunately , Naghma &apos;s father didn &apos;t have the money , and so the two men agreed to a jirga .
__bs__ So simply put , a jirga is a form of mediation that &apos;s used in Afghanistan &apos;s informal justice system .
__bs__ It &apos;s usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders , and jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan , where there &apos;s deep-seated resentment against the formal system .
__bs__ At the jirga , the men sat together and they decided that the best way to satisfy the debt would be if Naghma married the neighbor &apos;s 21-year-old son .
__bs__ She was six .
__bs__ Now , stories like Naghma &apos;s unfortunately are all too common , and from the comforts of our home , we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women &apos;s rights .
__bs__ And if you watched Afghanistan on the news , you may have this view that it &apos;s a failed state .
__bs__ However , Afghanistan does have a legal system , and while jirgas are built on long-standing tribal customs , even in jirgas , laws are supposed to be followed , and it goes without saying that giving a child to satisfy a debt is not only grossly immoral , it &apos;s illegal .
__bs__ In 2008 , I went to Afghanistan for a justice funded program , and I went there originally on this nine-month program to train Afghan lawyers .
__bs__ In that nine months , I went around the country and I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up , and I talked to many businesses that were also operating in Afghanistan .
__bs__ And within these conversations , I started hearing the connections between the businesses and the people , and how laws that were meant to protect them were being underused , while gross and illegal punitive measures were overused .
__bs__ And so this put me on a quest for justness , and what justness means to me is using laws for their intended purpose , which is to protect .
__bs__ The role of laws is to protect .
__bs__ So as a result , I decided to open up a private practice , and I became the first foreigner to litigate in Afghan courts .
__bs__ Throughout this time , I also studied many laws , I talked to many people , I read up on many cases , and I found that the lack of justness is not just a problem in Afghanistan , but it &apos;s a global problem .
__bs__ And so I started representing people like Naghma pro bono also .
__bs__ Now , since I &apos;ve been in Afghanistan and since I &apos;ve been an attorney for over 10 years , I &apos;ve represented from CEOs of Fortune 500 companies to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma , and with much success .
__bs__ And the reason for my success is very simple : I work the system from the inside out and use the laws in the ways that they &apos;re intended to be used .
__bs__ I find that achieving justness in places like Afghanistan is difficult , and there &apos;s three reasons .
__bs__ The second issue is that even with laws on the books , it &apos;s often superseded or ignored by tribal customs , like in the first jirga that sold Naghma off .
__bs__ And the third problem with achieving justness is that even with good , existing laws on the books , there aren &apos;t people or lawyers that are willing to fight for those laws .
__bs__ And that &apos;s what I do : I use existing laws , often unused laws , and I work those to the benefits of my clients .
__bs__ We all need to create a global culture of human rights and be investors in a global human rights economy , and by working in this mindset , we can significantly improve justice globally .
__bs__ Now let &apos;s get back to Naghma .
__bs__ Several people heard about this story , and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $ 2,500 debt .
__bs__ So I told them I &apos;d get involved , but in order to get involved , what needed to happen is a second jirga needed to be called , a jirga of appeals .
__bs__ And so in order for that to happen , we needed to get the village elders together , we needed to get the tribal leaders together , the religious leaders .
__bs__ And I thought , if I &apos;m going to get involved in this thing , then they also need to agree that I preside over it .
__bs__ So , after hours of talking and tracking them down , and about 30 cups of tea , they finally agreed that we could sit down for a second jirga , and we did .
__bs__ And what was different about the second jirga is this time , we put the law at the center of it , and it was very important for me that they all understood that Naghma had a right to be protected .
__bs__ And at the end of this jirga , it was ordered by the judge that the first decision was erased , and that the $ 2,500 debt was satisfied , and we all signed a written order where all the men acknowledged that what they did was illegal , and if they did it again , that they would go to prison .
__bs__ And most importantly , the engagement was terminated and Naghma was free .
__bs__ Protecting Naghma and her right to be free protects us .
__bs__ Now , with my job , there &apos;s above-average amount of risks that are involved .
__bs__ I &apos;ve been temporarily detained .
__bs__ I &apos;ve been accused of running a brothel , accused of being a spy .
__bs__ I &apos;ve had a grenade thrown at my office .
__bs__ It didn &apos;t go off , though .
__bs__ With every case that I take , I realize that as much as I &apos;m standing behind my clients , that they &apos;re also standing behind me , and that &apos;s what keeps me going .
__bs__ Law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us .
__bs__ Journalists are very vital in making sure that that information is given to the public .
__bs__ Too often , we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given .
__bs__ This picture is a picture of the British press corps in Afghanistan .
__bs__ It was taken a couple of years ago by my friend David Gill .
__bs__ According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , since 2010 , there have been thousands of journalists who have been threatened , injured , killed , detained .
__bs__ Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan .
__bs__ He works for The New York Times , and unfortunately , a few months ago he wrote an article that displeased people in the government .
__bs__ As a result , he was temporarily detained and he was illegally exiled out of the country .
__bs__ I represent Matt , and after dealing with the government , I was able to get legal acknowledgment that in fact he was illegally exiled , and that freedom of the press does exist in Afghanistan , and there &apos;s consequences if that &apos;s not followed .
__bs__ And I &apos;m happy to say that as of a few days ago , the Afghan government formally invited him back into the country and they reversed their exile order of him .
__bs__ ( Applause ) If you censor one journalist , then it intimidates others , and soon nations are silenced .
__bs__ It &apos;s important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press , because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent .
__bs__ Protecting journalists and our right to receive information protects us .
__bs__ Our world is changing . We live in a different world now , and what were once individual problems are really now global problems for all of us .
__bs__ Two weeks ago , Afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected president Ashraf Ghani , which is huge , and I &apos;m very optimistic about him , and I &apos;m hopeful that he &apos;ll give Afghanistan the changes that it needs , especially within the legal sector .
__bs__ We live in a different world .
__bs__ We live in a world where my eight-year-old daughter only knows a black president .
__bs__ There &apos;s a great possibility that our next president will be a woman , and as she gets older , she may question , can a white guy be president ?
__bs__ According to UNICEF , there are currently over 280 million boys and girls who are married under the age of 15 .
__bs__ Two hundred and eighty million .
__bs__ Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle of poverty , poor health , lack of education .
__bs__ At the age of 12 , Sahar was married .
__bs__ She was forced into this marriage and sold by her brother .
__bs__ When she went to her in-laws &apos; house , they forced her into prostitution .
__bs__ Because she refused , she was tortured .
__bs__ She was severely beaten with metal rods .
__bs__ They burned her body .
__bs__ They tied her up in a basement and starved her .
__bs__ They used pliers to take out her fingernails .
__bs__ At one point , she managed to escape from this torture chamber to a neighbor &apos;s house , and when she went there , instead of protecting her , they dragged her back to her husband &apos;s house , and she was tortured even worse .
__bs__ As a lawyer , I try to be very strong for all my clients , because that &apos;s very important to me , but seeing her , how broken and very weak as she was , was very difficult .
__bs__ It took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her when she was in that house , but finally she started opening up to me , and when she opened up , what I heard was she didn &apos;t know what her rights were , but she did know she had a certain level of protection by her government that failed her , and so we were able to talk about what her legal options were .
__bs__ And so we decided to take this case to the Supreme Court .
__bs__ Now , this is extremely significant , because this is the first time that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan was being represented by a lawyer , a law that &apos;s been on the books for years and years , but until Sahar , had never been used .
__bs__ In addition to this , we also decided to sue for civil damages , again using a law that &apos;s never been used , but we used it for her case .
__bs__ So there we were at the Supreme Court arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices , me as an American female lawyer , and Sahar , a young woman who when I met her couldn &apos;t speak above a whisper .
__bs__ She stood up , she found her voice , and my girl told them that she wanted justice , and she got it .
__bs__ At the end of it all , the court unanimously agreed that her in-laws should be arrested for what they did to her , her fucking brother should also be arrested for selling her — ( Applause ) — and they agreed that she did have a right to civil compensation .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But in all actuality , what I do looks like this .
__bs__ I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like . &quot; &quot; The laws are ours , and no matter what your ethnicity , nationality , gender , race , they belong to us , and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity .
__bs__ Businesses also need to get with the program .
__bs__ A corporate investment in human rights is a capital gain on your businesses , and whether you &apos;re a business , an NGO , or a private citizen , rule of law benefits all of us .
__bs__ And by doing this , we can achieve justness together .
__bs__ Thank you .

__bs__ ( Applause ) Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in 2007 , and when her efforts were honored in 2011 , and she was given the national youth peace prize , and she became a very famous , very popular young girl of her country .
__bs__ Before that , she was my daughter , but now I am her father .
__bs__ Ladies and gentlemen , if we glance to human history , the story of women is the story of injustice , inequality , violence and exploitation .
__bs__ You see , in patriarchal societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her birth is not celebrated .
__bs__ She is not welcomed , neither by father nor by mother .
__bs__ The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father .
__bs__ And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child .
__bs__ When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
__bs__ When she gives birth to the second daughter , she is shocked , and in the expectation of a son , when she gives birth to a third daughter , she feels guilty like a criminal .
__bs__ Not only the mother suffers , but the daughter , the newly born daughter , when she grows old , she suffers too .
__bs__ At the age of five , while she should be going to school , she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school .
__bs__ Until the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life .
__bs__ She can have fun .
__bs__ She can play with her friends in the streets , and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly .
__bs__ But when she enters her teens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort .
__bs__ She is confined under the four walls of her home .
__bs__ She is no more a free individual .
__bs__ She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family , and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor , she could even be killed .
__bs__ And it is also interesting that this so-called code of honor , it does not only affect the life of a girl , it also affects the life of the male members of the family .
__bs__ I know a family of seven sisters and one brother , and that one brother , he has migrated to the Gulf countries , to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents , because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood .
__bs__ So this brother , he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called honor .
__bs__ And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience .
__bs__ A good girl is supposed to be very quiet , very humble and very submissive .
__bs__ It is the criteria .
__bs__ The role model good girl should be very quiet .
__bs__ She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them .
__bs__ If she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient .
__bs__ If she is married very early , she has to accept .
__bs__ Otherwise , she will be called disobedient .
__bs__ And what happens at the end ?
__bs__ In the words of a poetess , she is wedded , bedded , and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters .
__bs__ And it is the irony of the situation that this mother , she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons .
__bs__ And this vicious cycle goes on , goes on .
__bs__ Ladies and gentlemen , this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently , if women and men think differently , if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries , if they can break a few norms of family and society , if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states , which go against the basic human rights of the women .
__bs__ Dear brothers and sisters , when Malala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like newborn children , to be honest , but when I went and I looked into her eyes , believe me , I got extremely honored .
__bs__ And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan .
__bs__ Her name was Malalai of Maiwand , and I named my daughter after her .
__bs__ A few days after Malala was born , my daughter was born , my cousin came — and it was a coincidence — he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the Yousafzai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors .
__bs__ But when I looked , all were men , and I picked my pen , drew a line from my name , and wrote , &quot; &quot; Malala . &quot; &quot; And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I admitted her in my school .
__bs__ You will be asking , then , why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school ?
__bs__ Yes , I must mention it .
__bs__ It may be taken for granted in Canada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patriarchal societies , in tribal societies , it &apos;s a big event for the life of girl .
__bs__ Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name .
__bs__ Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life .
__bs__ I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and you will be astonished , two weeks before , when I was filling out the Canadian visa form , and I was filling out the family part of the form , I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters .
__bs__ And the reason was that I have never , never seen the names of my sisters written on any document .
__bs__ That was the reason that I valued my daughter .
__bs__ What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters , I thought I must change it .
__bs__ I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter .
__bs__ I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
__bs__ I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings .
__bs__ And all these good values , I tried to inculcate in her personality .
__bs__ And this was not only she , only Malala .
__bs__ I imparted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well .
__bs__ I used education for emancipation .
__bs__ I taught my girls , I taught my girl students , to unlearn the lesson of obedience .
__bs__ I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor .
__bs__ Dear brothers and sisters , we were striving for more rights for women , and we were struggling to have more , more and more space for the women in society .
__bs__ But we came across a new phenomenon .
__bs__ It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women &apos;s rights .
__bs__ It was called Talibanization .
__bs__ It means a complete negation of women &apos;s participation in all political , economical and social activities .
__bs__ Hundreds of schools were lost .
__bs__ Girls were prohibited from going to school .
__bs__ Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets .
__bs__ Musicians were silenced , girls were flogged and singers were killed .
__bs__ Millions were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog , and you speak for your rights .
__bs__ It &apos;s really the most scary thing .
__bs__ At the age of 10 , Malala stood , and she stood for the right of education .
__bs__ She wrote a diary for the BBC blog , she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries , and she spoke from every platform she could .
__bs__ And her voice was the most powerful voice .
__bs__ It spread like a crescendo all around the world .
__bs__ And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign , and on October 9 2012 , she was shot in the head at point blank range .
__bs__ It was a doomsday for my family and for me .
__bs__ The world turned into a big black hole .
__bs__ While my daughter was on the verge of life and death , I whispered into the ears of my wife , &quot; &quot; Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; &quot; And she abruptly told me , &quot; &quot; Please don &apos;t blame yourself .
__bs__ You stood for the right cause .
__bs__ You put your life at stake for the cause of truth , for the cause of peace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you .
__bs__ You both were on the right path and God will protect her . &quot; &quot; These few words meant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again .
__bs__ When Malala was in the hospital , and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down , I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife .
__bs__ But my daughter never complained .
__bs__ She used to tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face .
__bs__ I &apos;ll be okay . Please don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; She was a solace for us , and she consoled us .
__bs__ Dear brothers and sisters , we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women , she is like any 16-year old girl .
__bs__ She cries when her homework is incomplete .
__bs__ She quarrels with her brothers , and I am very happy for that .
__bs__ People ask me , what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised ?
__bs__ I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did .
__bs__ Ask me what I did not do .
__bs__ I did not clip her wings , and that &apos;s all .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Applause )
__bs__ Hi .
__bs__ Let me ask the audience a question : Did you ever lie as a child ?
__bs__ If you did , could you please raise your hand ?
__bs__ Wow ! This is the most honest group of people I &apos;ve ever met .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So for the last 20 years , I &apos;ve been studying how children learn to tell lies .
__bs__ And today , I &apos;m going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made .
__bs__ But to begin , I &apos;m going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina , who is my friend and an elementary school principal .
__bs__ He got a phone call one day .
__bs__ The caller says , &quot; &quot; Mr. Messina , my son Johnny will not come to school today because he &apos;s sick . &quot; &quot; Mr. Messina asks , &quot; Who am I speaking to , please ? &quot;
__bs__ And the caller says , &quot; I am my father . &quot;
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So this story — ( Laughter ) sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying .
__bs__ One , children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school .
__bs__ Two , children are poor liars .
__bs__ We adults can easily detect their lies .
__bs__ And three , if children lie at a very young age , there must be some character flaws with them , and they are going to become pathological liars for life .
__bs__ Well , it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong .
__bs__ We have been playing guessing games with children all over the world .
__bs__ Here is an example .
__bs__ So in this game , we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards .
__bs__ And we tell them if they win the game , they are going to get a big prize .
__bs__ But in the middle of the game , we make an excuse and leave the room .
__bs__ And before we leave the room , we tell them not to peek at the cards .
__bs__ Of course , we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move .
__bs__ Because the desire to win the game is so strong , more than 90 percent of children will peek as soon as we leave the room .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) The crucial question is : When we return and ask the children whether or not they have peeked , will the children who peeked confess or lie about their transgression ?
__bs__ We found that regardless of gender , country , religion , at two years of age , 30 percent lie , 70 percent tell the truth about their transgression .
__bs__ At three years of age , 50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth .
__bs__ At four years of age , more than 80 percent lie .
__bs__ And after four years of age , most children lie .
__bs__ So as you can see , lying is really a typical part of development .
__bs__ And some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age .
__bs__ So now , let &apos;s take a closer look at the younger children .
__bs__ Why do some but not all young children lie ?
__bs__ In cooking , you need good ingredients to cook good food .
__bs__ And good lying requires two key ingredients .
__bs__ The first key ingredient is theory of mind , or the mind-reading ability .
__bs__ Mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what I know and what you know .
__bs__ Mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that I know you don &apos;t know what I know .
__bs__ Therefore , I can lie to you .
__bs__ The second key ingredient for good lying is self-control .
__bs__ It is the ability to control your speech , your facial expression and your body language , so that you can tell a convincing lie .
__bs__ And we found that those young children who have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars .
__bs__ As it turns out , these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society .
__bs__ In fact , deficits in mind-reading and self-control abilities are associated with serious developmental problems , such as ADHD and autism .
__bs__ So if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie , instead of being alarmed , you should celebrate — ( Laughter ) because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone of typical development .
__bs__ Now , are children poor liars ?
__bs__ Do you think you can easily detect their lies ?
__bs__ Would you like to give it a try ?
__bs__ Yes ? OK .
__bs__ So I &apos;m going to show you two videos .
__bs__ In the videos , the children are going to respond to a researcher &apos;s question , &quot; Did you peek ? &quot;
__bs__ So try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth .
__bs__ Here &apos;s child number one .
__bs__ Are you ready ?
__bs__ ( Video ) Adult : Did you peek ? Child : No .
__bs__ Kang Lee : And this is child number two .
__bs__ ( Video ) Adult : Did you peek ? Child : No .
__bs__ KL : OK , if you think child number one is lying , please raise your hand .
__bs__ And if you think child number two is lying , please raise your hand .
__bs__ OK , so as a matter of fact , child number one is telling the truth , child number two is lying .
__bs__ Looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children &apos;s lies .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Now , we have played similar kinds of games with many , many adults from all walks of life .
__bs__ And we show them many videos .
__bs__ In half of the videos , the children lied .
__bs__ In the other half of the videos , the children told the truth .
__bs__ And let &apos;s find out how these adults performed .
__bs__ Because there are as many liars as truth tellers , if you guess randomly , there &apos;s a 50 percent chance you &apos;re going to get it right .
__bs__ So if your accuracy is around 50 percent , it means you are a terrible detector of children &apos;s lies .
__bs__ So let &apos;s start with undergrads and law school students , who typically have limited experience with children .
__bs__ No , they cannot detect children &apos;s lies .
__bs__ Their performance is around chance .
__bs__ Now how about social workers and child-protection lawyers , who work with children on a daily basis ?
__bs__ Can they detect children &apos;s lies ?
__bs__ No , they cannot .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) What about judges , customs officers and police officers , who deal with liars on a daily basis ?
__bs__ Can they detect children &apos;s lies ?
__bs__ No , they cannot .
__bs__ What about parents ?
__bs__ Can parents detect other children &apos;s lies ?
__bs__ No , they cannot .
__bs__ What about , can parents detect their own children &apos;s lies ?
__bs__ No , they cannot .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So now you may ask why children &apos;s lies are so difficult to detect .
__bs__ Let me illustrate this with my own son , Nathan .
__bs__ This is his facial expression when he lies .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So when children lie , their facial expression is typically neutral .
__bs__ However , behind this neutral expression , the child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions , such as fear , guilt , shame and maybe a little bit of liar &apos;s delight .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Unfortunately , such emotions are either fleeting or hidden .
__bs__ Therefore , it &apos;s mostly invisible to us .
__bs__ So in the last five years , we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions .
__bs__ Then we made a discovery .
__bs__ We know that underneath our facial skin , there &apos;s a rich network of blood vessels .
__bs__ When we experience different emotions , our facial blood flow changes subtly .
__bs__ And these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control .
__bs__ By looking at facial blood flow changes , we can reveal people &apos;s hidden emotions .
__bs__ Unfortunately , such emotion-related facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye .
__bs__ So to help us reveal people &apos;s facial emotions , we have developed a new imaging technology we call &quot; &quot; transdermal optical imaging . &quot; &quot; To do so , we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions .
__bs__ And then , using our image processing technology , we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes .
__bs__ By looking at transdermal video images , now we can easily see facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions .
__bs__ And using this technology , we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying , and therefore detect people &apos;s lies .
__bs__ We can do so noninvasively , remotely , inexpensively , with an accuracy at about 85 percent , which is far better than chance level .
__bs__ And in addition , we discovered a Pinocchio effect .
__bs__ No , not this Pinocchio effect .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) This is the real Pinocchio effect .
__bs__ When people lie , the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases , and the facial blood flow on the nose increases .
__bs__ Of course , lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions .
__bs__ So then we asked ourselves , in addition to detecting lies , how can our technology be used ?
__bs__ One application is in education .
__bs__ For example , using this technology , we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience high anxiety about the topic he &apos;s teaching so that he can help him .
__bs__ And also we can use this in health care .
__bs__ For example , every day I Skype my parents , who live thousands of miles away .
__bs__ And using this technology , I can not only find out what &apos;s going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate , their stress level , their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain .
__bs__ And perhaps in the future , their risks for heart attack or hypertension .
__bs__ And you may ask : Can we use this also to reveal politicians &apos; emotions ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) For example , during a debate .
__bs__ Well , the answer is yes .
__bs__ Using TV footage , we could detect the politicians &apos; heart rate , mood and stress , and perhaps in the future , whether or not they are lying to us .
__bs__ We can also use this in marketing research , for example , to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products .
__bs__ We can even use it in dating .
__bs__ So for example , if your date is smiling at you , this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you .
__bs__ And in this case , she is just trying to be nice to you .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development .
__bs__ Many new applications will come about that we don &apos;t know today .
__bs__ However , one thing I know for sure is that lying will never be the same again .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ Xiè xie .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I know what you &apos;re thinking .
__bs__ You think I &apos;ve lost my way , and somebody &apos;s going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .
__bs__ ( Applause ) I get that all the time in Dubai .
__bs__ &quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
__bs__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Come to visit the children ?
__bs__ How long are you staying ? &quot; &quot; Well actually , I hope for a while longer yet .
__bs__ I have been living and teaching in the Gulf for over 30 years .
__bs__ ( Applause ) And in that time , I have seen a lot of changes .
__bs__ Now that statistic is quite shocking .
__bs__ And I want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of English .
__bs__ I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi .
__bs__ And one fine day , she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .
__bs__ But it was she who ended up learning all the Arabic words for the local plants , as well as their uses — medicinal uses , cosmetics , cooking , herbal .
__bs__ How did those students get all that knowledge ?
__bs__ Of course , from their grandparents and even their great-grandparents .
__bs__ It &apos;s not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations .
__bs__ But sadly , today , languages are dying at an unprecedented rate .
__bs__ A language dies every 14 days .
__bs__ Now , at the same time , English is the undisputed global language .
__bs__ Could there be a connection ?
__bs__ Well I don &apos;t know .
__bs__ But I do know that I &apos;ve seen a lot of changes .
__bs__ When I first came out to the Gulf , I came to Kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post .
__bs__ Actually , not that long ago .
__bs__ That is a little bit too early .
__bs__ But nevertheless , I was recruited by the British Council , along with about 25 other teachers .
__bs__ And we were the first non-Muslims to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait .
__bs__ We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .
__bs__ And of course , the U.K. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth .
__bs__ Okay .
__bs__ Now this is the major change that I &apos;ve seen — how teaching English has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today .
__bs__ No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum , and no longer the sole domain of mother England , it has become a bandwagon for every English-speaking nation on earth .
__bs__ And why not ?
__bs__ After all , the best education — according to the latest World University Rankings — is to be found in the universities of the U.K. and the U.S.
__bs__ So everybody wants to have an English education , naturally .
__bs__ But if you &apos;re not a native speaker , you have to pass a test .
__bs__ Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?
__bs__ Perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
__bs__ Would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ?
__bs__ Well , I don &apos;t think so .
__bs__ We English teachers reject them all the time .
__bs__ We put a stop sign , and we stop them in their tracks .
__bs__ They can &apos;t pursue their dream any longer , &apos; til they get English .
__bs__ Now let me put it this way : if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer , would I stop him from entering my British University ?
__bs__ I don &apos;t think so .
__bs__ But indeed , that is exactly what we do .
__bs__ We English teachers are the gatekeepers .
__bs__ And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough .
__bs__ Now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society .
__bs__ Maybe the barrier would be too universal .
__bs__ Okay .
__bs__ &quot; &quot; But , &quot; &quot; I hear you say , &quot; &quot; what about the research ?
__bs__ It &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So the books are in English , the journals are done in English , but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy .
__bs__ It feeds the English requirement .
__bs__ And so it goes on .
__bs__ I ask you , what happened to translation ?
__bs__ If you think about the Islamic Golden Age , there was lots of translation then .
__bs__ They translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic , into Persian , and then it was translated on into the Germanic languages of Europe and the Romance languages .
__bs__ And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe .
__bs__ Now don &apos;t get me wrong ; I am not against teaching English , all you English teachers out there .
__bs__ I love it that we have a global language .
__bs__ We need one today more than ever .
__bs__ But I am against using it as a barrier .
__bs__ Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English , or Chinese ?
__bs__ We need more than that . Where do we draw the line ?
__bs__ This system equates intelligence with a knowledge of English , which is quite arbitrary .
__bs__ ( Applause ) And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today &apos;s intelligentsia stand did not have to have English , they didn &apos;t have to pass an English test .
__bs__ Case in point , Einstein .
__bs__ He , by the way , was considered remedial at school because he was , in fact , dyslexic .
__bs__ But fortunately for the world , he did not have to pass an English test .
__bs__ Because they didn &apos;t start until 1964 with TOEFL , the American test of English .
__bs__ Now it &apos;s exploded .
__bs__ There are lots and lots of tests of English .
__bs__ And millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
__bs__ Now you might think , you and me , &quot; Those fees aren &apos;t bad , they &apos;re okay , &quot; but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people .
__bs__ So immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
__bs__ ( Applause ) It brings to mind a headline I saw recently : &quot; Education : The Great Divide . &quot;
__bs__ Now I get it , I understand why people would want to focus on English .
__bs__ They want to give their children the best chance in life .
__bs__ And to do that , they need a Western education .
__bs__ Because , of course , the best jobs go to people out of the Western Universities , that I put on earlier .
__bs__ It &apos;s a circular thing .
__bs__ Okay .
__bs__ Let me tell you a story about two scientists , two English scientists .
__bs__ They were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals .
__bs__ But they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
__bs__ They really didn &apos;t know what to do , until along came a German scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb , whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does German .
__bs__ So bingo , problem solved .
__bs__ If you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
__bs__ But if another language can think that thought , then , by cooperating , we can achieve and learn so much more .
__bs__ My daughter came to England from Kuwait .
__bs__ She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic .
__bs__ It &apos;s an Arabic-medium school .
__bs__ She had to translate it into English at her grammar school .
__bs__ And she was the best in the class at those subjects .
__bs__ Which tells us that when students come to us from abroad , we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know , and they know it in their own language .
__bs__ When a language dies , we don &apos;t know what we lose with that language .
__bs__ This is — I don &apos;t know if you saw it on CNN recently — they gave the Heroes Award to a young Kenyan shepherd boy who couldn &apos;t study at night in his village , like all the village children , because the kerosene lamp , it had smoke and it damaged his eyes .
__bs__ And anyway , there was never enough kerosene , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
__bs__ So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
__bs__ And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home .
__bs__ ( Applause ) When he received his award , he said these lovely words : &quot; &quot; The children can lead Africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent . &quot; &quot; A simple idea , but it could have such far-reaching consequences .
__bs__ People who have no light , whether it &apos;s physical or metaphorical , cannot pass our exams , and we can never know what they know .
__bs__ Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark .
__bs__ Let us celebrate diversity .
__bs__ Mind your language .
__bs__ Use it to spread great ideas .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view , and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion .
__bs__ The truth of the matter is otherwise .
__bs__ Our holy book , the Koran , consists of 114 chapters , and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala , the saying of &quot; &quot; In the name of God , the all compassionate , the all merciful , &quot; &quot; or , as Sir Richard Burton — not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor , but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature — translates it . &quot; &quot; In the name of God , the compassionating , the compassionate . &quot; &quot; And in a saying of the Koran , which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity , God says to his prophet Muhammad —
__bs__ whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets , beginning with Adam , including Noah , including Moses , including Abraham , including Jesus Christ , and ending with Muhammad — that , &quot; &quot; We have not sent you , O Muhammad , except as a &apos; rahmah , &apos; except as a source of compassion to humanity . &quot; &quot; For us human beings , and certainly for us as Muslims , whose mission , and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet .
__bs__ And the prophet , in one of his sayings , said , &quot; Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God . &quot;
__bs__ And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion — in fact , the Koran says that &quot; &quot; God decreed upon himself compassion , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; reigned himself in by compassion &quot; &quot; — therefore , our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion , activators of compassion , actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion .
__bs__ That is all well and good , but where do we go wrong , and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world ?
__bs__ For the answer to this , we turn to our spiritual path .
__bs__ In every religious tradition , there is the outer path and the inner path , or the exoteric path and the esoteric path .
__bs__ The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism , or &quot; &quot; tasawwuf &quot; &quot; in Arabic .
__bs__ And these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition , refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
__bs__ In one of the battles that the prophet waged , he told his followers , &quot; &quot; We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war , to the greater battle . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Messenger of God , we are battle-weary .
__bs__ How can we go to a greater battle ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; That is the battle of the self , the battle of the ego . &quot; &quot; The sources of human problems have to do with egotism , &quot; &quot; I. &quot; &quot; The famous Sufi master Rumi , who is very well known to most of you , has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend , and he knocks on the door , and a voice answers , &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s me , &quot; or , more grammatically correctly , &quot; It is I , &quot; as we might say in English .
__bs__ The voice says , &quot; &quot; Go away . &quot; &quot; After many years of training , of disciplining , of search and struggle , he comes back .
__bs__ With much greater humility , he knocks again on the door .
__bs__ The voice asks , &quot; &quot; Who is there ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It is you , O heartbreaker . &quot; &quot; The door swings open , and the voice says , &quot; Come in , for there is no room in this house for two I &apos;s , &quot; — two capital I &apos;s , not these eyes — &quot; &quot; for two egos . &quot; &quot; And Rumi &apos;s stories are metaphors for the spiritual path .
__bs__ In the presence of God , there is no room for more than one &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; and that is the &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; of divinity .
__bs__ In a teaching — called a &quot; &quot; hadith qudsi &quot; &quot; in our tradition — God says that , &quot; &quot; My servant , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; My creature , my human creature , does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do . &quot; &quot; And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean .
__bs__ You want your employees to do what you ask them to do , and if they &apos;ve done that , then they can do extra .
__bs__ But don &apos;t ignore what you &apos;ve asked them to do .
__bs__ &quot; &quot; And , &quot; &quot; God says , &quot; &quot; my servant continues to get nearer to me , by doing more of what I &apos;ve asked them to do &quot; &quot; — extra credit , we might call it — &quot; &quot; until I love him or love her .
__bs__ And when I love my servant , &quot; &quot; God says , &quot; &quot; I become the eyes by which he or she sees , the ears by which he or she listens , the hand by which he or she grasps , and the foot by which he or she walks , and the heart by which he or she understands . &quot; &quot; It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions .
__bs__ Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism , the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path .
__bs__ When he says , &quot; &quot; I am the spirit , and I am the way , &quot; &quot; and when the prophet Muhammad said , &quot; &quot; Whoever has seen me has seen God , &quot; &quot; it is because they became so much an instrument of God , they became part of God &apos;s team — so that God &apos;s will was manifest through them , and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos .
__bs__ Compassion on earth is given , it is in us .
__bs__ All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way .
__bs__ I &apos;m sure , probably all of you here , or certainly the very vast majority of you , have had what you might call a spiritual experience , a moment in your lives when , for a few seconds , a minute perhaps , the boundaries of your ego dissolved .
__bs__ And at that minute , you felt at one with the universe — one with that jug of water , one with every human being , one with the Creator — and you felt you were in the presence of power , of awe , of the deepest love , the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives .
__bs__ That is a moment which is a gift of God to us — a gift when , for a moment , he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on &quot; &quot; I , I , I , me , me , me , &quot; &quot; and instead , like the person in Rumi &apos;s story , we say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is all you .
__bs__ This is all you . And this is all us .
__bs__ And us , and I , and us are all part of you .
__bs__ O , Creator ! O , the Objective ! The source of our being and the end of our journey , you are also the breaker of our hearts .
__bs__ You are the one whom we should all be towards , for whose purpose we live , and for whose purpose we shall die , and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings . &quot; &quot; Our message today , and our purpose today , and those of you who are here today , and the purpose of this charter of compassion , is to remind .
__bs__ For the Koran always urges us to remember , to remind each other , because the knowledge of truth is within every human being .
__bs__ We know it all .
__bs__ We have access to it all .
__bs__ Jung may have called it &quot; &quot; the subconscious . &quot; &quot; Through our subconscious , in your dreams — the Koran calls our state of sleep &quot; &quot; the lesser death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary death &quot; &quot; — in our state of sleep we have dreams , we have visions , we travel even outside of our bodies , for many of us , and we see wonderful things .
__bs__ We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it , and beyond the limitations of time as we know it .
__bs__ But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating , the compassionate .
__bs__ God , Bokh , whatever name you want to call him with , Allah , Ram , Om , whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity , it is the locus of absolute being , absolute love and mercy and compassion , and absolute knowledge and wisdom , what Hindus call &quot; &quot; satchidananda . &quot; &quot; The language differs , but the objective is the same .
__bs__ Rumi has another story about three men , a Turk , an Arab and — and I forget the third person , but for my sake , it could be a Malay .
__bs__ One is asking for angur — one is , say , an Englishman — one is asking for eneb , and one is asking for grapes .
__bs__ And they have a fight and an argument because — &quot; &quot; I want grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want eneb . &quot; &quot; I want angur . &quot; &quot; — not knowing that the word that they &apos;re using refers to the same reality in different languages .
__bs__ There &apos;s only one absolute reality by definition , one absolute being by definition , because absolute is , by definition , single , and absolute and singular .
__bs__ There &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , the absolute concentration of consciousness , awareness , an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity .
__bs__ And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human .
__bs__ For what defines humanity , perhaps biologically , is our physiology , but God defines humanity by our spirituality , by our nature .
__bs__ And the Koran says , He speaks to the angels and says , &quot; &quot; When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay , and breathed into him of my spirit , then , fall in prostration to him . &quot; &quot; The angels prostrate , not before the human body , but before the human soul .
__bs__ Why ? Because the soul , the human soul , embodies a piece of the divine breath , a piece of the divine soul .
__bs__ This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image .
__bs__ What is the imagery of God ?
__bs__ The imagery of God is absolute being , absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love .
__bs__ And therefore , for us to be human — in the greatest sense of what it means to be human , in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human — means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us , and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being , of being alive , of beingness ; the attribute of wisdom , of consciousness , of awareness ; and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .
__bs__ This is what I understand from my faith tradition , and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world .
__bs__ And I believe , personally , that we &apos;re on the verge and that , with the presence and help of people like you here , we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah .
__bs__ For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore .
__bs__ We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option : we must , we must lower our egos , control our egos — whether it is individual ego , personal ego , family ego , national ego — and let all be for the glorification of the one .
__bs__ Thank you , and God bless you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ What is going to be the future of learning ?
__bs__ I do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , I need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage .
__bs__ I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
__bs__ And you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from .
__bs__ It came from about 300 years ago , and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet . &#91; &quot; &quot; The British Empire &quot; &quot; &#93; Imagine trying to run the show , trying to run the entire planet , without computers , without telephones , with data handwritten on pieces of paper , and traveling by ships .
__bs__ But the Victorians actually did it .
__bs__ What they did was amazing .
__bs__ They created a global computer made up of people .
__bs__ It &apos;s still with us today .
__bs__ It &apos;s called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
__bs__ In order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people .
__bs__ They made another machine to produce those people : the school .
__bs__ The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine .
__bs__ They must be identical to each other .
__bs__ They must know three things : They must have good handwriting , because the data is handwritten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multiplication , division , addition and subtraction in their head .
__bs__ They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand and ship them to Canada and he would be instantly functional .
__bs__ The Victorians were great engineers .
__bs__ They engineered a system that was so robust that it &apos;s still with us today , continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists .
__bs__ The empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?
__bs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Schools as we know them are obsolete &quot; &quot; &#93; So that &apos;s a pretty strong comment there .
__bs__ I said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re obsolete .
__bs__ I &apos;m not saying they &apos;re broken .
__bs__ It &apos;s quite fashionable to say that the education system &apos;s broken .
__bs__ It &apos;s not broken . It &apos;s wonderfully constructed .
__bs__ It &apos;s just that we don &apos;t need it anymore . It &apos;s outdated .
__bs__ What are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
__bs__ Well , the clerks are the computers .
__bs__ They &apos;re there in thousands in every office .
__bs__ And you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs .
__bs__ Those people don &apos;t need to be able to write beautifully by hand .
__bs__ They don &apos;t need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads .
__bs__ They do need to be able to read .
__bs__ In fact , they need to be able to read discerningly .
__bs__ Well , that &apos;s today , but we don &apos;t even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like .
__bs__ We know that people will work from wherever they want , whenever they want , in whatever way they want .
__bs__ How is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
__bs__ Well , I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident .
__bs__ I used to teach people how to write computer programs in New Delhi , 14 years ago .
__bs__ And right next to where I used to work , there was a slum .
__bs__ And I used to think , how on Earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
__bs__ Or should they not ?
__bs__ At the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , my son , I think he &apos;s gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers .
__bs__ And my daughter — oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot; &quot; And so on . So I suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) What did the poor do wrong ?
__bs__ I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one , didn &apos;t know any English , didn &apos;t know what the Internet was .
__bs__ The children came running in .
__bs__ It was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Why have you put it there ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Just like that . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Can we touch it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you wish to . &quot; &quot; And I went away .
__bs__ About eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
__bs__ So I said , &quot; &quot; Well that &apos;s impossible , because — How is it possible ? They don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; My colleagues said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solution .
__bs__ One of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; So I repeated the experiment . I went 300 miles out of Delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little . ( Laughter ) I repeated the experiment there .
__bs__ There was no place to stay , so I stuck my computer in , I went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it .
__bs__ When they saw me , they said , &quot; We want a faster processor and a better mouse . &quot;
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; How on Earth do you know all this ? &quot; &quot; And they said something very interesting to me .
__bs__ In an irritated voice , they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in English , so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the first time , as a teacher , that I had heard the word &quot; &quot; teach ourselves &quot; &quot; said so casually .
__bs__ Here &apos;s a short glimpse from those years .
__bs__ That &apos;s the first day at the Hole in the Wall .
__bs__ On your right is an eight-year-old .
__bs__ To his left is his student . She &apos;s six .
__bs__ And he &apos;s teaching her how to browse .
__bs__ Then onto other parts of the country , I repeated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were .
__bs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Hole in the wall film - 1999 &quot; &quot; &#93; An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do .
__bs__ And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is , and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a processor inside . &quot; &quot; So I started publishing .
__bs__ I published everywhere . I wrote down and measured everything , and I said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West .
__bs__ I &apos;d seen it happen over and over and over again .
__bs__ But I was curious to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?
__bs__ I started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation .
__bs__ There &apos;s one community of children in southern India whose English pronunciation is really bad , and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs .
__bs__ I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer , and I said , &quot; &quot; Keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They did that , and watch a little bit of this .
__bs__ Computer : Nice to meet you.Child : Nice to meet you .
__bs__ Sugata Mitra : The reason I ended with the face of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her .
__bs__ She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear English accent .
__bs__ So then people said , well , how far will it go ?
__bs__ Where does it stop ?
__bs__ I decided I would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition .
__bs__ I made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
__bs__ Tamil is a south Indian language , and I said , can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English from a streetside computer ?
__bs__ And I said , I &apos;ll measure them . They &apos;ll get a zero .
__bs__ I &apos;ll spend a couple of months , I &apos;ll leave it for a couple of months , I &apos;ll go back , they &apos;ll get another zero .
__bs__ I &apos;ll go back to the lab and say , we need teachers .
__bs__ I found a village . It was called Kallikuppam in southern India .
__bs__ I put in Hole in the Wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication , most of which I didn &apos;t understand .
__bs__ The children came rushing , said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s all this ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very topical , very important . But it &apos;s all in English . &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; How can we understand such big English words and diagrams and chemistry ? &quot; &quot; So by now , I had developed a new pedagogical method , so I applied that . I said , &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t the foggiest idea . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; And anyway , I am going away . &quot; ( Laughter )
__bs__ So I left them for a couple of months .
__bs__ They &apos;d got a zero . I gave them a test .
__bs__ I came back after two months and the children trooped in and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what did I expect ? &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you can &apos;t understand anything ? &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; We haven &apos;t given up .
__bs__ We look at it every single day . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; What ? You don &apos;t understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? What for ? &quot; &quot; So a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken Tamil and English , she said , &quot; &quot; Well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease , we haven &apos;t understood anything else . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So I tested them .
__bs__ I got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a decade ahead of their time .
__bs__ Absurd . But I had to follow the Victorian norm .
__bs__ Thirty percent is a fail .
__bs__ How do I get them to pass ? I have to get them 20 more marks .
__bs__ I couldn &apos;t find a teacher . What I did find was a friend that they had , a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time .
__bs__ So I asked this girl , &quot; &quot; Can you help them ? &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; Absolutely not .
__bs__ I didn &apos;t have science in school . I have no idea what they &apos;re doing under that tree all day long . I can &apos;t help you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what . Use the method of the grandmother . &quot; &quot; So she says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Stand behind them .
__bs__ Whenever they do anything , you just say , &apos; Well , wow , I mean , how did you do that ?
__bs__ What &apos;s the next page ? Gosh , when I was your age , I could have never done that . &apos; You know what grannies do . &quot; &quot; So she did that for two more months .
__bs__ The scores jumped to 50 percent .
__bs__ Kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in New Delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher .
__bs__ When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field .
__bs__ Here &apos;s Kallikuppam .
__bs__ ( Children speaking ) Neurons ... communication .
__bs__ I got the camera angle wrong . That one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate .
__bs__ At 12 .
__bs__ So what are jobs going to be like ?
__bs__ Well , we know what they &apos;re like today .
__bs__ What &apos;s learning going to be like ? We know what it &apos;s like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand .
__bs__ What will it be tomorrow ?
__bs__ Could it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
__bs__ Could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?
__bs__ Could it be — a devastating question , a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte — could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete ?
__bs__ But that &apos;s terrible . We are homo sapiens .
__bs__ Knowing , that &apos;s what distinguishes us from the apes .
__bs__ But look at it this way .
__bs__ It took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become Homo sapiens .
__bs__ It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete .
__bs__ What an achievement that is .
__bs__ But we have to integrate that into our own future .
__bs__ Encouragement seems to be the key .
__bs__ If you look at Kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that I did , it was simply saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , &quot; &quot; saluting learning .
__bs__ There is evidence from neuroscience .
__bs__ The reptilian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s threatened , it shuts down everything else , it shuts down the prefrontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shuts all of that down .
__bs__ Punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
__bs__ We take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , &quot; &quot; Perform . &quot; &quot; Why did they create a system like that ?
__bs__ Because it was needed .
__bs__ There was an age in the Age of Empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat .
__bs__ When you &apos;re standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you &apos;re okay , you &apos;ve passed .
__bs__ If you didn &apos;t , you failed .
__bs__ But the Age of Empires is gone .
__bs__ What happens to creativity in our age ?
__bs__ We need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
__bs__ I came back to England looking for British grandmothers .
__bs__ I put out notices in papers saying , if you are a British grandmother , if you have broadband and a web camera , can you give me one hour of your time per week for free ?
__bs__ I got 200 in the first two weeks .
__bs__ I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re called the Granny Cloud .
__bs__ The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet .
__bs__ If there &apos;s a child in trouble , we beam a Gran .
__bs__ She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out .
__bs__ I &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called Diggles in northwestern England , deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu , India , 6,000 miles away .
__bs__ She does it with only one age-old gesture .
__bs__ &quot; Shhh . &quot;
__bs__ Okay ?
__bs__ Watch this .
__bs__ Grandmother : You can &apos;t catch me . You say it . You can &apos;t catch me .
__bs__ Children : You can &apos;t catch me . Grandmother : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man.Children : I &apos;m the Gingerbread Man . Grandmother : Well done ! Very good . SM : So what &apos;s happening here ? I think what we need to look at is
__bs__ we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization .
__bs__ If you allow the educational process to self-organize , then learning emerges .
__bs__ It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
__bs__ It &apos;s about letting it happen .
__bs__ The teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens .
__bs__ I think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
__bs__ But how will we know ? How will we come to know ?
__bs__ Well , I intend to build these Self-Organized Learning Environments .
__bs__ They are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together .
__bs__ I &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools .
__bs__ It &apos;s been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of stand back and say , &quot; &quot; It just happens by itself ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How did you know that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t believe the children who told me and where they &apos;re from . &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a SOLE in action .
__bs__ ( Children talking ) This one is in England .
__bs__ He maintains law and order , because remember , there &apos;s no teacher around .
__bs__ Girl : The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons — SM : Australia Girl : — giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge .
__bs__ The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
__bs__ SM : A decade ahead of her time .
__bs__ So SOLEs , I think we need a curriculum of big questions .
__bs__ You already heard about that . You know what that means .
__bs__ There was a time when Stone Age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , &quot; What are those twinkling lights ? &quot;
__bs__ They built the first curriculum , but we &apos;ve lost sight of those wondrous questions .
__bs__ We &apos;ve brought it down to the tangent of an angle .
__bs__ But that &apos;s not sexy enough .
__bs__ The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say , &quot; &quot; If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth , how would you figure out if it was going to or not ? &quot; &quot; And if he says , &quot; &quot; Well , what ? how ? &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a magic word . It &apos;s called the tangent of an angle , &quot; &quot; and leave him alone . He &apos;ll figure it out .
__bs__ So here are a couple of images from SOLEs .
__bs__ I &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions — &quot; &quot; When did the world begin ? How will it end ? &quot; &quot; — to nine-year-olds .
__bs__ This one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
__bs__ This is done by children without the help of any teacher .
__bs__ The teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer .
__bs__ So what &apos;s my wish ?
__bs__ My wish is that we design the future of learning .
__bs__ We don &apos;t want to be spare parts for a great human computer , do we ?
__bs__ So we need to design a future for learning .
__bs__ And I &apos;ve got to — hang on , I &apos;ve got to get this wording exactly right , because , you know , it &apos;s very important .
__bs__ My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together .
__bs__ Help me build this school .
__bs__ It will be called the School in the Cloud .
__bs__ It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in .
__bs__ The way I want to do this is to build a facility where I can study this .
__bs__ It &apos;s a facility which is practically unmanned .
__bs__ There &apos;s only one granny who manages health and safety .
__bs__ The rest of it &apos;s from the cloud .
__bs__ The lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc . , etc . , everything &apos;s done from the cloud .
__bs__ But I want you for another purpose .
__bs__ You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clubs .
__bs__ It &apos;s very easy to do . There &apos;s a great document produced by TED which tells you how to do it .
__bs__ If you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then I &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the School of Clouds , and create the future of learning .
__bs__ That &apos;s my wish .
__bs__ And just one last thing .
__bs__ I &apos;ll take you to the top of the Himalayas .
__bs__ At 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , I once built two Hole in the Wall computers , and the children flocked there .
__bs__ And there was this little girl who was following me around .
__bs__ And I said to her , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to give a computer to everybody , every child .
__bs__ I don &apos;t know , what should I do ? &quot; &quot; And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly .
__bs__ She suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; Get on with it . &quot;
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I think it was good advice .
__bs__ I &apos;ll follow her advice . I &apos;ll stop talking .
__bs__ Thank you . Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . Wow . ( Applause )
__bs__ Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see .
__bs__ A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task , until now .
__bs__ Hello , my name is Dennis Hong , and we &apos;re bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired .
__bs__ So before I talk about this car for the blind , let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge .
__bs__ Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .
__bs__ You press start , nobody touches anything , and it can reach its destination fully autonomously .
__bs__ So in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
__bs__ So about that time , the National Federation of the Blind , or NFB , challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently .
__bs__ We decided to give it a try , because we thought , &quot; &quot; Hey , how hard could it be ? &quot; &quot; We have already an autonomous vehicle .
__bs__ We just put a blind person in it and we &apos;re done , right ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) We couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
__bs__ What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
__bs__ So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch .
__bs__ So to test this crazy idea , we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility .
__bs__ And in the summer of 2009 , we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin .
__bs__ It was an absolutely amazing experience .
__bs__ But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , closed-off parking lot — even the lanes defined by red traffic cones .
__bs__ So with this success , we decided to take the next big step , to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads .
__bs__ So how does it work ?
__bs__ Well , it &apos;s a rather complex system , but let me try to explain it , maybe simplify it .
__bs__ So we have three steps .
__bs__ We have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
__bs__ Now obviously the driver cannot see , so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver .
__bs__ For that , we use an initial measurement unit .
__bs__ So it measures acceleration , angular acceleration — like a human ear , inner ear .
__bs__ We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car .
__bs__ We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
__bs__ And we also use three laser range finders .
__bs__ The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
__bs__ So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer , and the computer can do two things .
__bs__ One is , first of all , process this information to have an understanding of the environment — these are the lanes of the road , there &apos;s the obstacles — and convey this information to the driver .
__bs__ The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car .
__bs__ So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .
__bs__ But the problem is this : How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive ?
__bs__ So for this , we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology .
__bs__ So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system , a vibrating vest , a click wheel with voice commands , a leg strip , even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot .
__bs__ But today we &apos;re going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces .
__bs__ Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip .
__bs__ So these are a pair of gloves , and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer — the direction and the intensity .
__bs__ Another device is called SpeedStrip .
__bs__ So this is a chair — as a matter of fact , it &apos;s actually a massage chair .
__bs__ We gut it out , and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns , and we actuate them to convey information about the speed , and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal .
__bs__ So over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment , and because you cannot see the vibration , we actually put red LED &apos;s on the driver so that you can see what &apos;s happening .
__bs__ This is the sensory data , and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer .
__bs__ So these two devices , DriveGrip and SpeedStrip , are very effective .
__bs__ But the problem is these are instructional cue devices .
__bs__ So this is not really freedom , right ?
__bs__ The computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .
__bs__ We call this the &quot; &quot; backseat-driver problem . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re moving away from the instructional cue devices , and we &apos;re now focusing more on the informational devices .
__bs__ A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix .
__bs__ So think of it as a monitor for the blind .
__bs__ So it &apos;s a small tablet , has many holes in it , and compressed air comes out , so it can actually draw images .
__bs__ So even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
__bs__ Actually , you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature .
__bs__ So it &apos;s actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
__bs__ So here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix .
__bs__ For this , we &apos;re showing a simulator , a blind person driving using the AirPix .
__bs__ This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces .
__bs__ So basically that &apos;s how it works .
__bs__ So just a month ago , on January 29th , we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex 24 racing event .
__bs__ We also had some surprises . Let &apos;s take a look .
__bs__ ( Music ) ( Video ) Announcer : This is an historic day in January .
__bs__ He &apos;s coming up to the grandstand , fellow Federationists .
__bs__ ( Cheering ) ( Honking ) There &apos;s the grandstand now .
__bs__ And he &apos;s &#91; unclear &#93; following that van that &apos;s out in front of him .
__bs__ Well there comes the first box .
__bs__ Now let &apos;s see if Mark avoids it .
__bs__ He does . He passes it on the right .
__bs__ Third box is out . The fourth box is out .
__bs__ And he &apos;s perfectly making his way between the two .
__bs__ He &apos;s closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
__bs__ Well this is what it &apos;s all about , this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity .
__bs__ He &apos;s approaching the end of the run , makes his way between the barrels that are set up there .
__bs__ ( Honking ) ( Applause ) Dennis Hong : I &apos;m so happy for you .
__bs__ Mark &apos;s going to give me a ride back to the hotel .
__bs__ Mark Riccobono : Yes .
__bs__ ( Applause ) DH : So since we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
__bs__ Letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : &quot; Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine . &quot;
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But sometimes — ( Laughter ) But sometimes I also do get — I wouldn &apos;t call it hate mail — but letters of really strong concern : &quot; &quot; Dr. Hong , are you insane , trying to put blind people on the road ?
__bs__ You must be out of your mind . &quot; &quot; But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle , and it &apos;s not going to be on the road until it &apos;s proven as safe as , or safer than , today &apos;s vehicle .
__bs__ And I truly believe that this can happen .
__bs__ But still , will the society , would they accept such a radical idea ?
__bs__ How are we going to handle insurance ?
__bs__ How are we going to issue driver &apos;s licenses ?
__bs__ There &apos;s many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality .
__bs__ Of course , the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind .
__bs__ But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
__bs__ The sensors that are used can see through the dark , the fog and rain .
__bs__ And together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people .
__bs__ Or for the blind , everyday home appliances — in the educational setting , in the office setting .
__bs__ Just imagine , in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what &apos;s written and read using these non-visual interfaces .
__bs__ This is priceless .
__bs__ So today , the things I &apos;ve showed you today , is just the beginning .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness , so if it was one , two , three , four , it &apos;s you , sir .
__bs__ You . Yeah . ( Laughter ) With the weird teeth . And you next to him . ( Laughter ) You know who you are .
__bs__ Actually , that whole row isn &apos;t right . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not good . Hi . Yeah . Real bad . Don &apos;t even look at me . ( Laughter ) I am one of the one in four . Thank you .
__bs__ I think I inherit it from my mother , who , used to crawl around the house on all fours .
__bs__ She had two sponges in her hand , and then she had two tied to her knees . My mother was completely absorbent . ( Laughter ) And she would crawl around behind me going , &quot; Who brings footprints into a building ? ! &quot;
__bs__ So that was kind of a clue that things weren &apos;t right .
__bs__ So before I start , I would like to thank the makers of Lamotrigine , Sertraline , and Reboxetine , because without those few simple chemicals , I would not be vertical today .
__bs__ So how did it start ?
__bs__ My mental illness — well , I &apos;m not even going to talk about my mental illness .
__bs__ What am I going to talk about ? Okay .
__bs__ I always dreamt that , when I had my final breakdown , it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque existentialist revelation , or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it . ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s not what happened . I had my breakdown during my daughter &apos;s sports day .
__bs__ And all the girlies , girlies running , running , running , everybody except for my daughter , who was just standing at the starting line , just waving , because she didn &apos;t know she was supposed to run .
__bs__ So I took to my bed for about a month , and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized , and when I saw the other inmates , I realized that I had found my people , my tribe . ( Laughter ) Because they became my only friends , they became my friends , because very few people that I knew — Well , I wasn &apos;t sent a lot of cards or flowers . I mean , if I had had a broken leg or I was with child I would have been inundated , but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up .
__bs__ Perk up .
__bs__ So you start to hear these abusive voices , but you don &apos;t hear one abusive voice , you hear about a thousand — 100,000 abusive voices , like if the Devil had Tourette &apos;s , that &apos;s what it would sound like .
__bs__ But we all know in here , you know , there is no Devil , there are no voices in your head .
__bs__ You know that when you have those abusive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic &quot; &quot; I want to kill myself &quot; &quot; kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape , you might have yourself depression .
__bs__ Oh , and that &apos;s not even the tip of the iceberg .
__bs__ If you get a little baby , and you abuse it verbally , its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn &apos;t grow , so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic .
__bs__ If a soldier sees his friend blown up , his brain goes into such high alarm that he can &apos;t actually put the experience into words , so he just feels the horror over and over again .
__bs__ So here &apos;s my question . My question is , how come when people have mental damage , it &apos;s always an active imagination ?
__bs__ How come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy , except the brain ?
__bs__ I &apos;d like to talk a little bit more about the brain , because I know you like that here at TED , so if you just give me a minute here , okay .
__bs__ Okay , let me just say , there &apos;s some good news .
__bs__ There is some good news . First of all , let me say , we &apos;ve come a long , long way .
__bs__ We started off as a teeny , teeny little one-celled amoeba , tiny , just sticking onto a rock , and now , voila , the brain .
__bs__ Here we go . ( Laughter ) This little baby has a lot of horsepower .
__bs__ It comes completely conscious . It &apos;s got state-of-the-art lobes .
__bs__ We &apos;ve got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world .
__bs__ We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world .
__bs__ Here we &apos;ve got a little bit of long-term memory , so , you know that night you want to forget , when you got really drunk ? Bye-bye ! Gone . ( Laughter ) So actually , it &apos;s filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away , electrically transmitting information , zizzing , zizzing . I &apos;m going to give you a little side view here .
__bs__ I don &apos;t know if you can get that here . ( Laughter ) So , zizzing away , and so — ( Laughter ) — And for every one — I know , I drew this myself . Thank you .
__bs__ But I got a little bad news for you folks . I got some bad news .
__bs__ This isn &apos;t for the one in four . This is for the four in four .
__bs__ Evolution did not prepare us for this . We just don &apos;t have the bandwidth , and for people who say , oh , they &apos;re having a nice day , they &apos;re perfectly fine , they &apos;re more insane than the rest of us .
__bs__ Because I &apos;ll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution . Okay , let me just explain this to you .
__bs__ I &apos;m sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but somebody has to be .
__bs__ And while we &apos;re at it , can we please stop the stigma ?
__bs__ Now , if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics , then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country .
__bs__ And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
__bs__ The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
__bs__ And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject .
__bs__ And at top of that pyramid , it &apos;s calculus .
__bs__ And I &apos;m here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
__bs__ that the correct summit — that all of our students , every high school graduate should know — should be statistics : probability and statistics .
__bs__ ( Applause ) I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong . Calculus is an important subject .
__bs__ It &apos;s one of the great products of the human mind .
__bs__ The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .
__bs__ And every student who studies math , science , engineering , economics , they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .
__bs__ But I &apos;m here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day-to-day lives .
__bs__ On the other hand , statistics — that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . Right ?
__bs__ It &apos;s risk . It &apos;s reward . It &apos;s randomness .
__bs__ It &apos;s understanding data .
__bs__ I think if our students , if our high school students — if all of the American citizens — knew about probability and statistics , we wouldn &apos;t be in the economic mess that we &apos;re in today . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Not only — thank you — not only that ...
__bs__ but if it &apos;s taught properly , it can be a lot of fun .
__bs__ I mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling .
__bs__ It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
__bs__ Look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
__bs__ And it &apos;s time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital , from the more classical , continuous mathematics , to the more modern , discrete mathematics — the mathematics of uncertainty , of randomness , of data — that being probability and statistics .
__bs__ In summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . And I mean it .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I will always remember the first time I met the girl in the blue uniform .
__bs__ I was eight at the time , living in the village with my grandmother , who was raising me and other children .
__bs__ Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe , and we just didn &apos;t have enough to eat .
__bs__ We were hungry .
__bs__ And that &apos;s when the girl in the blue uniform came to my village with the United Nations to feed the children .
__bs__ As she handed me my porridge , I asked her why she was there , and without hesitation , she said , &quot; As Africans , we must uplift all the people of Africa . &quot;
__bs__ I had absolutely no idea what she meant .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But her words stuck with me .
__bs__ Two years later , famine hit my country for the second time .
__bs__ My grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city to live with an aunt I had never met before .
__bs__ So at the age of 10 , I found myself in school for the very first time .
__bs__ And there , at the city school , I would experience what it was to be unequal .
__bs__ You see , in the village , we were all equal .
__bs__ But in the eyes and the minds of the other kids , I was not their equal .
__bs__ I couldn &apos;t speak English , and I was way behind in terms of reading and writing .
__bs__ But this feeling of inequality would get even more complex .
__bs__ Every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family .
__bs__ Suddenly , I had much more than the rest of my village .
__bs__ And in their eyes , I was no longer their equal .
__bs__ I felt guilty .
__bs__ But I thought about the girl in the blue uniform , and I remember thinking , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s who I want to be — someone like her , someone who uplifts other people . &quot; &quot; This childhood experience led me to the United Nations , and to my current role with UN Women , where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities that affects more than half of the world &apos;s population — women and girls .
__bs__ Today , I want to share with you a simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together .
__bs__ Eight months ago , under the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka , head of UN Women , we launched a groundbreaking initiative called HeForShe , inviting men and boys from around the world to stand in solidarity with each other and with women , to create a shared vision for gender equality .
__bs__ This is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men , and those who don &apos;t yet know that they believe .
__bs__ The initiative is based on a simple idea : that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us .
__bs__ We all feel the same things .
__bs__ We all want the same things , even when those things sometimes remain unspoken .
__bs__ HeForShe is about uplifting all of us , women and men together .
__bs__ It &apos;s moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality .
__bs__ Imagine a blank page with one horizontal line splitting it in half .
__bs__ Now imagine that women are represented here , and men are represented here .
__bs__ In our current population , HeForShe is about moving the 3.2 billion men , one man at a time , across that line , so that ultimately , men can stand alongside women and be on the right side of history , making gender equality a reality in the 21st century .
__bs__ However , engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial .
__bs__ Why invite men ? They are the problem .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) In fact , men don &apos;t care , we were told .
__bs__ But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe .
__bs__ In just three days , more than 100,000 men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality .
__bs__ Within that first week , at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted , and within that same week , HeForShe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media .
__bs__ And that &apos;s when the emails started pouring in , sometimes as many as a thousand a day .
__bs__ We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe , who , after hearing about HeForShe , created a &quot; &quot; husband school . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He literally went around his village , hand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners , and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers .
__bs__ In Pune , India , a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally , mobilizing 700 cyclists to share the HeForShe messages within their own community .
__bs__ In another impact story , a man sent a very personal note of something that had happened in his own community .
__bs__ He wrote , &quot; &quot; Dear Madam , I have lived all of my life next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife .
__bs__ Two weeks ago , I was listening to my radio , and your voice came on , and you spoke about something called the HeForShe , and the need for men to play their role .
__bs__ Within a few hours , I heard the woman cry again next door , but for the first time , I didn &apos;t just sit there .
__bs__ I felt compelled to do something , so I went over and I confronted the husband .
__bs__ Madam , it has been two weeks , and the woman has not cried since .
__bs__ Thank you for giving me a voice . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) Personal impact stories such as these show that we are tapping into something within men , but getting to a world where women and men are equal is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause .
__bs__ We want concrete , systematic , structural change that can equalize the political , economic and social realities for women and men .
__bs__ We are asking men to make concrete actions , calling them to intervene at a personal level , to change their behavior .
__bs__ We are calling upon governments , businesses , universities , to change their policies .
__bs__ We want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions .
__bs__ Already , a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete HeForShe commitments .
__bs__ In a few early success stories , a leading French hospitality company , Accor , has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020 .
__bs__ ( Applause ) The government of Sweden , under its current feminist government , has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term .
__bs__ In Japan , the University of Nagoya is building , as part of their HeForShe commitments , what will become one of Japan &apos;s leading gender-research centers .
__bs__ Now , eight months later , a movement is building .
__bs__ We are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life , and from every single corner in the world , from the United Nations &apos; own Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Secretary-Generals of NATO and the EU Council , from the prime minister of Bhutan to the president of Sierra Leone .
__bs__ In Europe alone , all the male EU Commissioners and the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments have signed up to be HeForShe .
__bs__ In fact , one in 20 men in Iceland has joined the movement .
__bs__ The rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador , Emma Watson , has garnered more than five billion media impressions , mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations .
__bs__ Now this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has for the world that we want to see .
__bs__ Einstein once said , &quot; &quot; A human being is part of the whole ...
__bs__ but he experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separate from the rest ...
__bs__ This delusion is a kind of prison for us ...
__bs__ Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion . &quot; &quot; If women and men are part of a greater whole , as Einstein suggests , it is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize that it is not our gender that defines us , but ultimately , our shared humanity .
__bs__ HeForShe is tapping into women &apos;s and men &apos;s dreams , the dreams that we have for ourselves , and the dreams that we have for our families , our children , friends , communities .
__bs__ So that &apos;s what it is about .
__bs__ HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature .
__bs__ The bad news is that mother nature &apos;s back office isn &apos;t working yet , so those invoices don &apos;t get issued .
__bs__ But we need to do something about this problem .
__bs__ I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest , but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature , and which doesn &apos;t get priced by the markets .
__bs__ A project called TEEB was started in 2007 , and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G8 + 5 .
__bs__ And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern .
__bs__ They asked themselves a question : If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change , well why can &apos;t the same be done for conservation ?
__bs__ Why can &apos;t an equivalent case be made for nature ?
__bs__ And the answer is : Yeah , it can .
__bs__ But it &apos;s not that straightforward .
__bs__ Biodiversity , the living fabric of this planet , is not a gas .
__bs__ It exists in many layers , ecosystems , species and genes across many scales — international , national , local , community — and doing for nature what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy .
__bs__ And yet , we began .
__bs__ We began the project with an interim report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many , many researchers .
__bs__ And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that , in fact , we were losing natural capital — the benefits that flow from nature to us .
__bs__ We were losing it at an extraordinary rate — in fact , of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital .
__bs__ This came out in 2008 , which was , of course , around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars .
__bs__ So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss .
__bs__ We then have gone on since to present for &#91; the &#93; international community , for governments , for local governments and for business and for people , for you and me , a whole slew of reports , which were presented at the U.N. last year , which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it .
__bs__ What is this about ?
__bs__ A picture that you &apos;re familiar with — the Amazon rainforests .
__bs__ It &apos;s a massive store of carbon , it &apos;s an amazing store of biodiversity , but what people don &apos;t really know is this also is a rain factory .
__bs__ Because the northeastern trade winds , as they go over the Amazonas , effectively gather the water vapor .
__bs__ Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds , and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin .
__bs__ This rainfall cycle , this rainfall factory , effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth in Latin America .
__bs__ But the question arises : Okay , so how much do Uruguay , Paraguay , Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas , which produces that rainfall ?
__bs__ And the answer is zilch , exactly zero .
__bs__ That &apos;s the economic invisibility of nature .
__bs__ That can &apos;t keep going on , because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful .
__bs__ Economics has become the currency of policy .
__bs__ And unless we address this invisibility , we are going to get the results that we are seeing , which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset .
__bs__ It &apos;s not just about the Amazonas , or indeed about rainforests .
__bs__ No matter what level you look at , whether it &apos;s at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level , we see the same problem again and again .
__bs__ So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level .
__bs__ At the species level , it &apos;s been estimated that insect-based pollination , bees pollinating fruit and so on , is something like 190 billion dollars-worth .
__bs__ That &apos;s something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally .
__bs__ It completely passes below the radar screen .
__bs__ But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ?
__bs__ Or for that matter , if you look at the genetic level , 60 percent of medicines were prospected , were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef .
__bs__ Once again , most of that doesn &apos;t get paid .
__bs__ And that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
__bs__ That genetic material probably belonged , if it could belong to anyone , to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule , which then became the medicine .
__bs__ They were the ones that didn &apos;t get paid .
__bs__ And if you look at the species level , you saw about fish .
__bs__ Today , the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor , the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods , to feed their families .
__bs__ Something like a billion people depend on fish , the quantity of fish in the oceans .
__bs__ A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein .
__bs__ And at this rate at which we are losing fish , it is a human problem of enormous dimensions , a health problem of a kind we haven &apos;t seen before .
__bs__ And finally , at the ecosystem level , whether it &apos;s flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests , or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats , or whether it &apos;s the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest , it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services .
__bs__ We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil , India and Indonesia , even though ecosystem services — these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free — they &apos;re not very big in percentage terms of GDP — two , four , eight , 10 , 15 percent — but in these countries , if we measure how much they &apos;re worth to the poor , the answers are more like 45 percent , 75 percent , 90 percent .
__bs__ That &apos;s the difference .
__bs__ Because these are important benefits for the poor .
__bs__ And you can &apos;t really have a proper model for development if at the same time you &apos;re destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset , the most important asset , which is your development asset , that is ecological infrastructure .
__bs__ How bad can things get ?
__bs__ Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance .
__bs__ It &apos;s basically a measure of how many tigers , toads , ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around .
__bs__ The green represents the percentage .
__bs__ If you start green , it &apos;s like 80 to 100 percent .
__bs__ If it &apos;s yellow , it &apos;s 40 to 60 percent .
__bs__ And these are percentages versus the original state , so to speak , the pre-industrial era , 1750 .
__bs__ Now I &apos;m going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
__bs__ And just watch the change in colors in India , China , Europe , sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us .
__bs__ See that again .
__bs__ The only places that remain green — and that &apos;s not good news — is , in fact , places like the Gobi Desert , like the tundra and like the Sahara .
__bs__ But that doesn &apos;t help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place .
__bs__ This is the challenge .
__bs__ The reason this is happening boils down , in my mind , to one basic problem , which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .
__bs__ We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth , it &apos;s common goods .
__bs__ And here &apos;s an example from Thailand where we found that , because the value of a mangrove is not that much — it &apos;s about $ 600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured — compared to its value as a shrimp farm , which is more like $ 9,600 , there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms .
__bs__ But of course , if you look at exactly what those profits are , almost 8,000 of those dollars are , in fact , subsidies .
__bs__ So you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it &apos;s more like 1,200 to 600 .
__bs__ That &apos;s not that hard .
__bs__ But on the other hand , if you start measuring , how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use ?
__bs__ Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects , that answer is more like $ 12,000 of cost .
__bs__ And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries , the fish nurseries , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 11,000 .
__bs__ So now look at the different lens .
__bs__ If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits , you get a completely different answer , which is clearly conservation makes more sense , and not destruction .
__bs__ So is this just a story from South Thailand ?
__bs__ Sorry , this is a global story .
__bs__ And here &apos;s what the same calculation looks like , which was done recently — well I say recently , over the last 10 years — by a group called TRUCOST .
__bs__ And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations , what are the externalities ?
__bs__ In other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ?
__bs__ This is not illegal stuff , this is basically business as usual , which causes climate-changing emissions , which have an economic cost .
__bs__ It causes pollutants being issued , which have an economic cost , health cost and so on .
__bs__ Use of freshwater .
__bs__ If you drill water to make coke near a village farm , that &apos;s not illegal , but yes , it costs the community .
__bs__ Can we stop this , and how ?
__bs__ I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital .
__bs__ Basically the stuff of life is natural capital , and we need to recognize and build that into our systems .
__bs__ When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level , we don &apos;t include our biggest asset at the country level .
__bs__ When we measure corporate performances , we don &apos;t include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society .
__bs__ That has to stop .
__bs__ In fact , this was what really inspired my interest in this phase .
__bs__ I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project .
__bs__ That was in the early 2000s when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth as the means forward — looking at China with its stellar growths of eight , nine , 10 percent and wondering , why can we do the same ?
__bs__ And a few friends of mine and I decided this doesn &apos;t make sense .
__bs__ This is going to create more cost to society and more losses .
__bs__ So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states .
__bs__ That &apos;s how my interests began and went to the TEEB project .
__bs__ Calculating this at the national level is one thing , and it has begun .
__bs__ And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they &apos;ve started a project called WAVES — Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services .
__bs__ But calculating this at the next level , that means at the business sector level , is important .
__bs__ And actually we &apos;ve done this with the TEEB project .
__bs__ We &apos;ve done this for a very difficult case , which was for deforestation in China .
__bs__ This is important , because in China in 1997 , the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society .
__bs__ Just a year later the Yangtze flooded , causing something like 5,500 deaths .
__bs__ So clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
__bs__ It was associated largely with the construction industry .
__bs__ And the Chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling .
__bs__ A retrospective on 40 years shows that if we had accounted for these costs — the cost of loss of topsoil , the cost of loss of waterways , the lost productivity , the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors , desertification and so on — those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber .
__bs__ So in fact , the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China .
__bs__ Of course , after the event one can be wise .
__bs__ The way to do this is to do it on a company basis , to take leadership forward , and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost , and to disclose these answers .
__bs__ Someone once asked me , &quot; &quot; Who is better or worse , is it Unilever or is it P &amp; G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia ? &quot; &quot; And I couldn &apos;t answer because neither of these companies , good though they are and professional though they are , do not calculate or disclose their externalities .
__bs__ But if we look at companies like PUMA — Jochen Zeitz , their CEO and chairman , once challenged me at a function , saying that he &apos;s going to implement my project before I finish it .
__bs__ Well I think we kind of did it at the same time , but he &apos;s done it .
__bs__ He &apos;s basically worked the cost to PUMA .
__bs__ PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover , 300 million dollars of profits , 200 million dollars after tax , 94 million dollars of externalities , cost to business .
__bs__ Now that &apos;s not a happy situation for them , but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s what we are measuring .
__bs__ We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s an example , I think , for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from .
__bs__ If more companies did this , and if more sectors engaged this as sectors , you could have analysts , business analysts , and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies .
__bs__ Today we can &apos;t yet do that , but I think the path is laid out .
__bs__ This can be done .
__bs__ And I &apos;m delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.
__bs__ has already set up a coalition to do this , an international coalition .
__bs__ The other favorite , if you like , solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets .
__bs__ And by the way , these are my favorites — externalities calculation and green carbon markets .
__bs__ TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco-certification and you name it , but these are the favorites .
__bs__ What &apos;s green carbon ?
__bs__ Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace .
__bs__ It &apos;s about energy emissions .
__bs__ The European Union ETS is the main marketplace .
__bs__ It &apos;s not doing too well . We &apos;ve over-issued .
__bs__ A bit like inflation : you over-issue currency , you get what you see , declining prices .
__bs__ But that &apos;s all about energy and industry .
__bs__ But what we &apos;re missing is also some other emissions like black carbon , that is soot .
__bs__ What we &apos;re also missing is blue carbon , which , by the way , is the largest store of carbon — more than 55 percent .
__bs__ Thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
__bs__ In fact , what &apos;s being absorbed is something like 25 percent of our emissions , which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans .
__bs__ More of that in a minute .
__bs__ And finally , there &apos;s deforestation , and there &apos;s emission of methane from agriculture .
__bs__ Green carbon , which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions , and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions .
__bs__ We have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechanism , called REDD Plus — a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .
__bs__ And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme .
__bs__ So we actually have some movement forward .
__bs__ But the thing is to do a lot more of that .
__bs__ Will this solve the problem ? Will economics solve everything ?
__bs__ Well I &apos;m afraid not .
__bs__ There is an area that is the oceans , coral reefs .
__bs__ As you can see , they cut across the entire globe all the way from Micronesia across Indonesia , Malaysia , India , Madagascar and to the West of the Caribbean .
__bs__ These red dots , these red areas , basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people .
__bs__ So that &apos;s almost an eighth of society .
__bs__ And the sad thing is that , as these coral reefs are lost — and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs — we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species , the warm water corals , we &apos;re not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans , but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than 500 million people who live in the developing world in poor countries .
__bs__ So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations , what we have done is we &apos;ve made an ethical choice .
__bs__ We &apos;ve actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
__bs__ Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that .
__bs__ Let &apos;s think about it and what it means , but please , let &apos;s not do more of that .
__bs__ Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital .
__bs__ I don &apos;t think we can afford too much of such ethical choices .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I grew up diagnosed as phobically shy , and , like at least 20 other people in a room of this size , I was a stutterer .
__bs__ Do you dare raise your hand ?
__bs__ And it sticks with us . It really does stick with us , because when we are treated that way , we feel invisible sometimes , or talked around and at .
__bs__ And as I started to look at people , which is mostly all I did , I noticed that some people really wanted attention and recognition .
__bs__ Remember , I was young then .
__bs__ So what did they do ?
__bs__ What we still do perhaps too often .
__bs__ We talk about ourselves .
__bs__ And yet there are other people I observed who had what I called a mutuality mindset .
__bs__ In each situation , they found a way to talk about us and create that &quot; &quot; us &quot; &quot; idea .
__bs__ There &apos;s no greater opportunity or call for action for us now than to become opportunity-makers who use best talents together more often for the greater good and accomplish things we couldn &apos;t have done on our own .
__bs__ And I want to talk to you about that , because even more than giving , even more than giving , is the capacity for us to do something smarter together for the greater good that lifts us both up and that can scale .
__bs__ That &apos;s why I &apos;m sitting here .
__bs__ But I also want to point something else out : Each one of you is better than anybody else at something .
__bs__ That disproves that popular notion that if you &apos;re the smartest person in the room , you &apos;re in the wrong room .
__bs__ And she had the fervent belief that every new building in Los Angeles should have public art in it .
__bs__ And as she was talking , a thought came to my mind .
__bs__ I said , &quot; &quot; I know someone you ought to meet .
__bs__ He &apos;s getting out of San Quentin in a couple of weeks &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect . &quot; &quot; He spent five years in solitary , and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin , and he &apos;s articulate and he &apos;s rather easy on the eyes because he &apos;s buff .
__bs__ He had workout regime he did every day .
__bs__ I think they &apos;d make good allies .
__bs__ And indeed they were .
__bs__ They met together . They prepared .
__bs__ They spoke in front of the Los Angeles City Council .
__bs__ And the council members not only passed the regulation , half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards .
__bs__ They were startling , compelling and credible .
__bs__ You can &apos;t buy that .
__bs__ What I &apos;m asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity- makers we might become , because more than wealth or fancy titles or a lot of contacts , it &apos;s our capacity to connect around each other &apos;s better side and bring it out .
__bs__ That &apos;s what opportunity-makers do .
__bs__ And here &apos;s a strange thing : Unlike an increasing number of Americans who are working and living and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme , opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations with people unlike them , and they &apos;re building relationships , and because they do that , they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a problem better and faster and seize more opportunities .
__bs__ They &apos;re not affronted by differences , they &apos;re fascinated by them , and that is a huge shift in mindset , and once you feel it , you want it to happen a lot more .
__bs__ This world is calling out for us to have a collective mindset , and I believe in doing that .
__bs__ It &apos;s especially important now .
__bs__ Why is it important now ?
__bs__ Because things can be devised like drones and drugs and data collection , and they can be devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes and then , as we know from the news every day , they can be used for dangerous ones .
__bs__ It calls on us , each of us , to a higher calling .
__bs__ But here &apos;s the icing on the cake : It &apos;s not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that &apos;s probably your greatest , as an institution or an individual .
__bs__ It &apos;s after you &apos;ve had that experience and you trust each other .
__bs__ It &apos;s the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted .
__bs__ And he thought , I have a set of racquetball courts .
__bs__ That guy could teach it .
__bs__ They &apos;re frequent travelers .
__bs__ That &apos;s how Wally got hired .
__bs__ Not only that , years later he was also teaching racquetball .
__bs__ Years after that , he was teaching the racquetball teachers .
__bs__ What I &apos;m suggesting is , when you connect with people around a shared interest and action , you &apos;re accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future , and I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at .
__bs__ We open ourselves up to those opportunities , and in this room are key players in technology , key players who are uniquely positioned to do this , to scale systems and projects together .
__bs__ So here &apos;s what I &apos;m calling for you to do .
__bs__ Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers .
__bs__ Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength and they become pattern seekers .
__bs__ So what I &apos;m asking you is , the world is hungry .
__bs__ I truly believe , in my firsthand experience , the world is hungry for us to unite together as opportunity-makers and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do — I know that firsthand — and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own .
__bs__ Thank you . ( Applause )
__bs__ Salaam alaikum .
__bs__ Welcome to Doha .
__bs__ I am in charge of making this country &apos;s food secure .
__bs__ That is my job for the next two years , to design an entire master plan , and then for the next 10 years to implement it — of course , with so many other people .
__bs__ But first , I need to talk to you about a story , which is my story , about the story of this country that you &apos;re all here in today .
__bs__ And of course , most of you have had three meals today , and probably will continue to have after this event .
__bs__ So going in , what was Qatar in the 1940s ?
__bs__ We were about 11,000 people living here .
__bs__ There was no water . There was no energy , no oil , no cars , none of that .
__bs__ None of the glamour that you see today existed .
__bs__ No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh .
__bs__ It wasn &apos;t that they couldn &apos;t develop cities .
__bs__ Resources weren &apos;t there to develop them .
__bs__ And you can see that life expectancy was also short .
__bs__ Most people died around the age of 50 .
__bs__ So let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
__bs__ 1939 , that &apos;s when they discovered oil .
__bs__ But unfortunately , it wasn &apos;t really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War .
__bs__ What did it do ?
__bs__ It changed the face of this country , as you can see today and witness .
__bs__ It also made all those people who roamed around the desert — looking for water , looking for food , trying to take care of their livestock — urbanize .
__bs__ You might find this strange , but in my family we have different accents .
__bs__ My mother has an accent that is so different to my father , and we &apos;re all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country .
__bs__ There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak .
__bs__ Someone says , &quot; &quot; How so ? How could this happen ? &quot; &quot; Because we lived scattered .
__bs__ We couldn &apos;t live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources .
__bs__ And when the resources came , be it oil , we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration .
__bs__ People started to get to know each other .
__bs__ And we realized that there are some differences in accents .
__bs__ So that is the chapter two : the oil era .
__bs__ Let &apos;s look at today .
__bs__ This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha .
__bs__ So what &apos;s the population today ?
__bs__ It &apos;s 1.7 million people .
__bs__ That is in less than 60 years .
__bs__ The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years .
__bs__ Lifespan has increased to 78 .
__bs__ Water consumption has increased to 430 liters .
__bs__ And this is amongst the highest worldwide .
__bs__ From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree , higher than any other nation .
__bs__ I don &apos;t know if this was a reaction to lack of water .
__bs__ But what is interesting about the story that I &apos;ve just said ?
__bs__ The interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water .
__bs__ Now that is historic . It &apos;s never happened before in history .
__bs__ Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water .
__bs__ This is history being made in this region .
__bs__ Not only cities that we &apos;re building , but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists , doctors .
__bs__ Build a nice home , bring the architect , design my house .
__bs__ These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn &apos;t .
__bs__ But of course , with the use of technology .
__bs__ So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain .
__bs__ Qatar has 74 , and we have that growth rate .
__bs__ The question is how .
__bs__ How could we survive that ?
__bs__ We have no water whatsoever .
__bs__ Simply because of this gigantic , mammoth machine called desalination .
__bs__ Energy is the key factor here . It changed everything .
__bs__ It is that thing that we pump out of the ground , we burn tons of , probably most of you used it coming to Doha .
__bs__ So that is our lake , if you can see it .
__bs__ That is our river .
__bs__ That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water .
__bs__ This is the best technology that this region could ever have : desalination .
__bs__ So what are the risks ?
__bs__ Do you worry much ?
__bs__ I would say , perhaps if you look at the global facts , you will realize , of course I have to worry .
__bs__ We &apos;ve turned seven billion only a few months ago .
__bs__ And so that number also demands food .
__bs__ And there &apos;s predictions that we &apos;ll be nine billion by 2050 .
__bs__ So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders .
__bs__ There &apos;s also changing diets .
__bs__ By elevating to a higher socio-economic level , they also change their diet .
__bs__ They start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
__bs__ And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen .
__bs__ This is the situation in Qatar , for those who don &apos;t know .
__bs__ We only have two days of water reserve .
__bs__ We import 90 percent of our food , and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land .
__bs__ The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions , etc . , etc .
__bs__ So we also face risks .
__bs__ These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity .
__bs__ The question is , is there a solution ?
__bs__ Is there a sustainable solution ?
__bs__ Indeed there is .
__bs__ This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we &apos;ve been working on over the past two years .
__bs__ Let &apos;s start with the water .
__bs__ So we know very well — I showed you earlier — that we need this energy .
__bs__ So if we &apos;re going to need energy , what sort of energy ?
__bs__ A depletable energy ? Fossil fuel ?
__bs__ Or should we use something else ?
__bs__ Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy ?
__bs__ And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need .
__bs__ And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water .
__bs__ And that is a lot of water .
__bs__ But what gels all of it , what enables it , is legislation , policies , regulations .
__bs__ Without it we can &apos;t do anything .
__bs__ So that &apos;s what we are planning to do .
__bs__ Our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : Istanbul , Rome , London , Paris , Damascus , Cairo .
__bs__ We are only 60 years old , but we want to live forever as a city , to live in peace .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Sleep .
__bs__ It &apos;s something we spend about a third of our lives doing , but do any of us really understand what it &apos;s all about ?
__bs__ Two thousand years ago , Galen , one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world , proposed that while we &apos;re awake , our brain &apos;s motive force , its juice , would flow out to all the other parts of the body , animating them but leaving the brain all dried up , and he thought that when we sleep , all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back , rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind .
__bs__ Now , that sounds completely ridiculous to us now , but Galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day .
__bs__ See , we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep , it clears your mind , and when you don &apos;t sleep , it leaves your mind murky .
__bs__ But while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when Galen was around , we still haven &apos;t understood why it is that sleep , of all of our activities , has this incredible restorative function for the mind .
__bs__ So today I want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question .
__bs__ So almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions , and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body .
__bs__ In the brain , that is especially critical ; its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body &apos;s entire energy supply , even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body &apos;s mass .
__bs__ So the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body .
__bs__ You can actually see it in this video here .
__bs__ Here , we &apos;re imaging blood vessels in the brain of a living mouse .
__bs__ The blood vessels form a complex network that fills the entire brain volume .
__bs__ They start at the surface of the brain , and then they dive down into the tissue itself , and as they spread out , they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain .
__bs__ Now , just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it , every cell also produces waste as a byproduct , and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve .
__bs__ This diagram shows the body &apos;s lymphatic system , which has evolved to meet this need .
__bs__ It &apos;s a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body .
__bs__ It takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells , it collects them , and then dumps them into the blood so they can be disposed of .
__bs__ But if you look really closely at this diagram , you &apos;ll see something that doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense .
__bs__ So if we were to zoom into this guy &apos;s head , one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain .
__bs__ But that doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense , does it ?
__bs__ I mean , the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared .
__bs__ And yet , it lacks lymphatic vessels , which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste won &apos;t work in the brain .
__bs__ So how , then , does the brain solve its waste clearance problem ?
__bs__ Well , that seemingly mundane question is where our group first jumped into this story , and what we found as we dove down into the brain , down among the neurons and the blood vessels , was that the brain &apos;s solution to the problem of waste clearance , it was really unexpected .
__bs__ It was ingenious , but it was also beautiful .
__bs__ Let me tell you about what we found .
__bs__ So the brain has this large pool of clean , clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid .
__bs__ We call it the CSF .
__bs__ The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain , and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the CSF , which gets dumped , along with the waste , into the blood .
__bs__ So in that way , it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system , doesn &apos;t it ?
__bs__ But what &apos;s interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain , they don &apos;t just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF .
__bs__ Instead , there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process .
__bs__ You can see that in these videos .
__bs__ Here , we &apos;re again imaging into the brain of living mice .
__bs__ The frame on your left shows what &apos;s happening at the brain &apos;s surface , and the frame on your right shows what &apos;s happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself .
__bs__ We &apos;ve labeled the blood vessels in red , and the CSF that &apos;s surrounding the brain will be in green .
__bs__ Now , what was surprising to us was that the fluid on the outside of the brain , it didn &apos;t stay on the outside .
__bs__ Instead , the CSF was pumped back into and through the brain along the outsides of the blood vessels , and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels , it was actually helping to clear away , to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain &apos;s cells .
__bs__ If you think about it , using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution , because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it &apos;s packed full of cells , so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system .
__bs__ And what &apos;s amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells .
__bs__ This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain .
__bs__ But our most surprising finding was that all of this , everything I just told you about , with all this fluid rushing through the brain , it &apos;s only happening in the sleeping brain .
__bs__ Here , the video on the left shows how much of the CSF is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it &apos;s awake .
__bs__ It &apos;s almost nothing .
__bs__ Yet in the same animal , if we wait just a little while until it &apos;s gone to sleep , what we see is that the CSF is rushing through the brain , and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep , the brain cells themselves seem to shrink , opening up spaces in between them , allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out .
__bs__ So it seems that Galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on .
__bs__ Our own research , now it &apos;s 2,000 years later , suggests that what &apos;s happening is that when the brain is awake and is at its most busy , it puts off clearing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later , and then , when it goes to sleep and doesn &apos;t have to be as busy , it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its cells , the waste that &apos;s accumulated throughout the day .
__bs__ So it &apos;s actually a little bit like how you or I , we put off our household chores during the work week when we don &apos;t have time to get to it , and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around .
__bs__ Now , I &apos;ve just talked a lot about waste clearance , but I haven &apos;t been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy .
__bs__ The waste product that these recent studies focused most on is amyloid-beta , which is a protein that &apos;s made in the brain all the time .
__bs__ My brain &apos;s making amyloid-beta right now , and so is yours .
__bs__ But in patients with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain &apos;s cells , instead of being cleared away like it &apos;s supposed to be , and it &apos;s this buildup of amyloid-beta that &apos;s thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease .
__bs__ So we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared from the brain when it &apos;s awake versus when it &apos;s asleep , and we found that indeed , the clearance of amyloid-beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain .
__bs__ So if sleep , then , is part of the brain &apos;s solution to the problem of waste clearance , then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep , amyloid-beta , and Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
__bs__ A series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven &apos;t yet developed Alzheimer &apos;s disease , worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid-beta building up in the brain , and while it &apos;s important to point out that these studies don &apos;t prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause Alzheimer &apos;s disease , they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta may contribute to the development of conditions like Alzheimer &apos;s .
__bs__ So what this new research tells us , then , is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep , that even Galen understood about sleep , that it refreshes and clears the mind , may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about .
__bs__ See , you and I , we go to sleep every single night , but our brains , they never rest .
__bs__ While our body is still and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere , the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work cleaning and maintaining this unimaginably complex machine .
__bs__ Like our housework , it &apos;s a dirty and a thankless job , but it &apos;s also important .
__bs__ In your house , if you stop cleaning your kitchen for a month , your home will become completely unlivable very quickly .
__bs__ But in the brain , the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty countertops , because when it comes to cleaning the brain , it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that &apos;s at stake , which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ So here it is . You can check : I am short , I &apos;m French , I have a pretty strong French accent , so that &apos;s going to be clear in a moment .
__bs__ Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about .
__bs__ And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year .
__bs__ And there is something else I believe in the back of your mind you also know .
__bs__ That is , every day , 25,000 children die of entirely preventable causes .
__bs__ That &apos;s a Haiti earthquake every eight days .
__bs__ And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well , but somehow it doesn &apos;t happen with the same intensity .
__bs__ So why is that ?
__bs__ Well , here is a thought experiment for you .
__bs__ Imagine you have a few million dollars that you &apos;ve raised — maybe you &apos;re a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend . You want to spend it on the poor : How do you go about it ?
__bs__ Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money ?
__bs__ That we know how to eradicate poverty , we just need to do more ?
__bs__ Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help , on the contrary it might hurt , it might exacerbate corruption , dependence , etc . ?
__bs__ Or maybe you turn to the past .
__bs__ After all , we have spent billions of dollars on aid .
__bs__ Maybe you look at the past and see .
__bs__ Has it done any good ?
__bs__ And , sadly , we don &apos;t know .
__bs__ And worst of all , we will never know .
__bs__ And the reason is that — take Africa for example .
__bs__ Africans have already got a lot of aid .
__bs__ These are the blue bars .
__bs__ And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress .
__bs__ Okay , fine . How do you know what would have happened without the aid ?
__bs__ Maybe it would have been much worse , or maybe it would have been better .
__bs__ We have no idea . We don &apos;t know what the counterfactual is .
__bs__ There &apos;s only one Africa .
__bs__ So what do you do ?
__bs__ To give the aid , and hope and pray that something comes out of it ?
__bs__ Or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen ?
__bs__ The thing is , if we don &apos;t know whether we are doing any good , we are not any better than the Medieval doctors and their leeches .
__bs__ Sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
__bs__ Is it the leeches ? Is it something else ?
__bs__ We don &apos;t know .
__bs__ So here are some other questions .
__bs__ They &apos;re smaller questions , but they are not that small .
__bs__ Immunization , that &apos;s the cheapest way to save a child &apos;s life .
__bs__ And the world has spent a lot of money on it : The GAVI and the Gates Foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it , and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort .
__bs__ And yet , every year at least 25 million children do not get the immunization they should get .
__bs__ So this is what you call a &quot; &quot; last mile problem . &quot; &quot; The technology is there , the infrastructure is there , and yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
__bs__ So you have your million .
__bs__ How do you use your million to solve this last mile problem ?
__bs__ And here &apos;s another question : Malaria . Malaria kills almost 900,000 people every year , most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa , most of them under five .
__bs__ In fact , that is the leading cause of under-five mortality .
__bs__ We already know how to kill malaria , but some people come to you and say , &quot; You have your millions . How about bed nets ? &quot;
__bs__ Bed nets are very cheap .
__bs__ For 10 dollars , you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them .
__bs__ And , not only do they protect the people who sleep under them , but they have these great contagion benefits .
__bs__ If half of a community sleeps under a net , the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread .
__bs__ And yet , only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net .
__bs__ Societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net , give them for free , or , for that matter , pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits .
__bs__ &quot; &quot; Not so fast , &quot; &quot; say other people .
__bs__ &quot; &quot; If you give the nets for free , people are not going to value them .
__bs__ They &apos;re not going to use them , or at least they &apos;re not going to use them as bed nets , maybe as fishing nets . &quot; &quot; So , what do you do ?
__bs__ Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage , or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ?
__bs__ How do you know ?
__bs__ And a third question : Education .
__bs__ Maybe that &apos;s the solution , maybe we should send kids to school .
__bs__ But how do you do that ?
__bs__ Do you hire teachers ? Do you build more schools ?
__bs__ Do you provide school lunch ?
__bs__ How do you know ?
__bs__ So here is the thing .
__bs__ I cannot answer the big question , whether aid did any good or not .
__bs__ But these three questions , I can answer them .
__bs__ It &apos;s not the Middle Ages anymore , it &apos;s the 21st century .
__bs__ And in the 20th century , randomized , controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don &apos;t work .
__bs__ And you can do the same randomized , controlled trial for social policy .
__bs__ You can put social innovation to the same rigorous , scientific tests that we use for drugs .
__bs__ And in this way , you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works , what doesn &apos;t work and why .
__bs__ And I &apos;ll give you some examples with those three questions .
__bs__ So I start with immunization .
__bs__ Here &apos;s Udaipur District , Rajasthan . Beautiful .
__bs__ Well , when I started working there , about one percent of children were fully immunized .
__bs__ That &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
__bs__ Now , it &apos;s not because the vaccines are not there — they are there and they are free — and it &apos;s not because parents do not care about their kids .
__bs__ The same child that is not immunized against measles , if they do get measles , parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them .
__bs__ So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals .
__bs__ So what is the problem ?
__bs__ Well , part of the problem , surely , is people do not fully understand .
__bs__ After all , in this country as well , all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization .
__bs__ So if that &apos;s the case , that &apos;s difficult , because persuasion is really difficult .
__bs__ But maybe there is another problem as well .
__bs__ It &apos;s going from intention to action .
__bs__ Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District , Rajasthan .
__bs__ You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized .
__bs__ And maybe when you get there , what you find is this : The subcenter is closed . Ao you have to come back , and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do , you will always tend to postpone and postpone , and eventually it gets too late .
__bs__ Well , if that &apos;s the problem , then that &apos;s much easier .
__bs__ Because A , we can make it easy , and B , we can maybe give people a reason to act today , rather than wait till tomorrow .
__bs__ So these are simple ideas , but we didn &apos;t know .
__bs__ So let &apos;s try them .
__bs__ So what we did is we did a randomized , controlled trial in 134 villages in Udaipur Districts .
__bs__ So the blue dots are selected randomly .
__bs__ We made it easy — I &apos;ll tell you how in a moment .
__bs__ In the red dots , we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now .
__bs__ The white dots are comparisons , nothing changed .
__bs__ So we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized .
__bs__ And then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization .
__bs__ Now , a kilo of lentils is tiny .
__bs__ It &apos;s never going to convince anybody to do something that they don &apos;t want to do .
__bs__ On the other hand , if your problem is you tend to postpone , then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later .
__bs__ So what do we find ?
__bs__ Well , beforehand , everything is the same .
__bs__ That &apos;s the beauty of randomization .
__bs__ Afterwards , the camp — just having the camp — increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent .
__bs__ That &apos;s full immunization .
__bs__ That &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good improvement .
__bs__ Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent .
__bs__ So here you &apos;ve got your answer .
__bs__ Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils , you multiply immunization rate by six .
__bs__ Now , you might say , &quot; &quot; Well , but it &apos;s not sustainable .
__bs__ We cannot keep giving lentils to people . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out it &apos;s wrong economics , because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them .
__bs__ Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway , the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don &apos;t .
__bs__ How about bed nets ?
__bs__ Should you give them for free , or should you ask people to pay for them ?
__bs__ So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions .
__bs__ One is : If people must pay for a bed net , are they going to purchase them ?
__bs__ The second one is : If I give bed nets for free , are people going to use them ?
__bs__ And the third one is : Do free bed nets discourage future purchase ?
__bs__ The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts , it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets .
__bs__ Now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric .
__bs__ It &apos;s more ideological than practical , but it turns out it &apos;s an easy question .
__bs__ We can know the answer to this question .
__bs__ We can just run an experiment .
__bs__ And many experiments have been run , and they all have the same results , so I &apos;m just going to talk to you about one .
__bs__ And this one that was in Kenya , they went around and distributed to people vouchers , discount vouchers .
__bs__ So people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy .
__bs__ And some people get 100 percent discount , and some people get 20 percent discounts , and some people get 50 percent discount , etc .
__bs__ And now we can see what happens .
__bs__ So , how about the purchasing ?
__bs__ Well , what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets , the coverage rate really falls down a lot .
__bs__ So even with partial subsidy , three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net , and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets , you lose the health immunity , that &apos;s not great .
__bs__ Second thing is , how about the use ?
__bs__ Well , the good news is , people , if they have the bed nets , will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it .
__bs__ If they get it for free , they use it .
__bs__ If they have to pay for it , they use it .
__bs__ How about the long term ?
__bs__ In the long term , people who got the free bed nets , one year later , were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars .
__bs__ And people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn &apos;t get a free one .
__bs__ So people do not get used to handouts ; they get used to nets .
__bs__ Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit .
__bs__ So , that &apos;s for bed nets . So you will think , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s great .
__bs__ You know how to immunize kids , you know how to give bed nets . &quot; &quot; But what politicians need is a range of options .
__bs__ They need to know : Out of all the things I could do , what is the best way to achieve my goals ?
__bs__ So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .
__bs__ There are so many things you could do . You could pay for uniforms , you could eliminate fees , you could build latrines , you could give girls sanitary pads , etc . , etc .
__bs__ So what &apos;s the best ?
__bs__ Well , at some level , we think all of these things should work .
__bs__ So , is that sufficient ? If we think they should work intuitively , should we go for them ?
__bs__ Well , in business , that &apos;s certainly not the way we would go about it .
__bs__ Consider for example transporting goods .
__bs__ Before the canals were invented in Britain before the Industrial Revolution , goods used to go on horse carts .
__bs__ And then canals were built , and with the same horseman and the same horse , you could carry ten times as much cargo .
__bs__ So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts , on the ground , that they would eventually get there ?
__bs__ Well , if that had been the case , there would have been no Industrial Revolution .
__bs__ So why shouldn &apos;t we do the same with social policy ?
__bs__ In technology , we spend so much time experimenting , fine-tuning , getting the absolute cheapest way to do something , so why aren &apos;t we doing that with social policy ?
__bs__ Well , with experiments , what you can do is answer a simple question .
__bs__ Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend on various interventions .
__bs__ How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars ?
__bs__ Now I &apos;m going to show you what we get with various education interventions .
__bs__ So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects , hire teachers , school meals , school uniforms , scholarships .
__bs__ And that &apos;s not bad . For your hundred dollars , you get between one and three extra years of education .
__bs__ Things that don &apos;t work so well is bribing parents , just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money .
__bs__ And here are the most surprising results .
__bs__ Tell people the benefits of education , that &apos;s very cheap to do .
__bs__ So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that , you get 40 extra years of education .
__bs__ And , in places where there are worms , intestinal worms , cure the kids of their worms .
__bs__ And for every hundred dollars , you get almost 30 extra years of education .
__bs__ So this is not your intuition , this is not what people would have gone for , and yet , these are the programs that work .
__bs__ We need that kind of information , we need more of it , and then we need to guide policy .
__bs__ So now , I started from the big problem , and I couldn &apos;t answer it .
__bs__ And I cut it into smaller questions , and I have the answer to these smaller questions .
__bs__ And they are good , scientific , robust answers .
__bs__ So let &apos;s go back to Haiti for a moment .
__bs__ In Haiti , about 200,000 people died — actually , a bit more by the latest estimate .
__bs__ And the response of the world was great : Two billion dollars got pledged just last month , so that &apos;s about 10,000 dollars per death .
__bs__ That doesn &apos;t sound like that much when you think about it .
__bs__ But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars for every child under five who dies , that would be 90 billion per year just for that problem .
__bs__ And yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
__bs__ So , why is that ?
__bs__ Well , I think what part of the problem is that , in Haiti , although the problem is huge , somehow we understand it , it &apos;s localized .
__bs__ You give your money to Doctors Without Borders , you give your money to Partners In Health , and they &apos;ll send in the doctors , and they &apos;ll send in the lumber , and they &apos;ll helicopter things out and in .
__bs__ And the problem of poverty is not like that .
__bs__ So , first , it &apos;s mostly invisible ; second , it &apos;s huge ; and third , we don &apos;t know whether we are doing the right thing .
__bs__ There &apos;s no silver bullet .
__bs__ You cannot helicopter people out of poverty .
__bs__ And that &apos;s very frustrating .
__bs__ But look what we just did today .
__bs__ I gave you three simple answers to three questions : Give lentils to immunize people , provide free bed nets , deworm children .
__bs__ With immunization or bed nets , you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved .
__bs__ With deworming , you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .
__bs__ So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet , but we can get started .
__bs__ And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective .
__bs__ Here &apos;s an example of how this can be powerful .
__bs__ Deworming .
__bs__ Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines .
__bs__ They are not beautiful and don &apos;t kill anybody .
__bs__ And yet , when the young global leader in Davos showed the numbers I gave you , they started Deworm the World .
__bs__ And thanks to Deworm the World , and the effort of many country governments and foundations , 20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009 .
__bs__ So this evidence is powerful .
__bs__ It can prompt action .
__bs__ So we should get started now .
__bs__ It &apos;s not going to be easy .
__bs__ It &apos;s a very slow process .
__bs__ You have to keep experimenting , and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality .
__bs__ And sometimes what works somewhere doesn &apos;t work elsewhere .
__bs__ So it &apos;s a slow process , but there is no other way .
__bs__ These economics I &apos;m proposing , it &apos;s like 20th century medicine .
__bs__ It &apos;s a slow , deliberative process of discovery .
__bs__ There is no miracle cure , but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year , and we can do the same thing .
__bs__ And now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that I started with at the beginning .
__bs__ I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference , but can we come back here in 30 years and say , &quot; &quot; What we have done , it really prompted a change for the better . &quot; &quot; I believe we can and I hope we will .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Sarge Salman : All the way from Los Altos Hills , California , Mr. Henry Evans .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Henry Evans : Hello .
__bs__ My name is Henry Evans , and until August 29 , 2002 , I was living my version of the American dream .
__bs__ I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis .
__bs__ My dad was a lawyer .
__bs__ My mom was a homemaker .
__bs__ My six siblings and I were good kids , but caused our fair share of trouble .
__bs__ After high school , I left home to study and learn more about the world .
__bs__ I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German , including spending a year of study in Austria .
__bs__ Later on , I earned an MBA at Stanford .
__bs__ I married my high school sweetheart , Jane .
__bs__ I am lucky to have her .
__bs__ Together , we raised four wonderful children .
__bs__ I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder , eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley , a job I really enjoyed .
__bs__ My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13 , 2001 , a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills , California , from where I am speaking to you now .
__bs__ We were looking forward to rebuilding it , but eight months after we moved in , I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect .
__bs__ Overnight , I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40 .
__bs__ It took me several years , but with the help of an incredibly supportive family , I finally decided life was still worth living .
__bs__ I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled .
__bs__ Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements , and enable my use of a regular computer .
__bs__ I can surf the web , exchange email with people , and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games .
__bs__ This technology allows me to remain engaged , mentally active , and feel like I am a part of the world .
__bs__ One day , I was lying in bed watching CNN , when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot .
__bs__ I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage , and we formed the Robots for Humanity project .
__bs__ For about two years , Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR2 as my body surrogate .
__bs__ I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years .
__bs__ From my home in California , I shaved Charlie in Atlanta . ( Laughter ) I handed out Halloween candy .
__bs__ I opened my refrigerator on my own .
__bs__ I began doing tasks around the house .
__bs__ I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute , both for myself and others in my circumstance .
__bs__ All of us have disabilities in one form or another .
__bs__ For example , if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour , both of us will need an assistive device called a car .
__bs__ Your disability doesn &apos;t make you any less of a person , and neither does mine .
__bs__ By the way , check out my sweet ride . ( Laughter ) Since birth , we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own .
__bs__ Last year , Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins .
__bs__ Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones .
__bs__ It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight , giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible .
__bs__ Using a mouse cursor I control with my head , these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser .
__bs__ With a little practice , I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own .
__bs__ I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing .
__bs__ I inspected the solar panels on our roof . ( Laughter ) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop .
__bs__ I went even further by seeing if I could use a head-mounted display , the Oculus Rift , as modified by Fighting Walrus , to have an immersive experience controlling the drone .
__bs__ With Chad &apos;s group at Brown , I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week , from my home 3,000 miles away .
__bs__ All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic , so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer . ( Laughter ) I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own .
__bs__ I just wish I could afford the tuition . ( Laughter ) Chad Jenkins : Henry , all joking aside , I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Okay , Henry , have you been to D.C. lately ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Can you show us how excited you are ? ( Laughter )
__bs__ All right , big finish .
__bs__ Can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
__bs__ ( Applause ) All right , we still have a little ways to go with that , but I think it shows the promise .
__bs__ What makes Henry &apos;s story amazing is it &apos;s about understanding Henry &apos;s needs , understanding what people in Henry &apos;s situation need from technology , and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide , and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way .
__bs__ What we &apos;re trying to do is democratize robotics , so that anybody can be a part of this .
__bs__ We &apos;re providing affordable , off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone , 300 dollars , the Suitable Technologies beam , only 17,000 dollars , along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we &apos;re trying to do .
__bs__ And our hope is that , by providing these tools , that you &apos;ll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled , to provide care for our aging population , to help better educate our children , to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future , to both monitor and protect our environment , and to explore the universe .
__bs__ Back to you , Henry .
__bs__ HE : Thank you , Chad .
__bs__ With this drone setup , we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world , and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination , where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else , and perhaps better , and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables .
__bs__ One hundred years ago , I would have been treated like a vegetable .
__bs__ Actually , that &apos;s not true .
__bs__ I would have died .
__bs__ It is up to us , all of us , to decide how robotics will be used , for good or for evil , for simply replacing people or for making people better , for allowing us to do and enjoy more .
__bs__ Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone &apos;s mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe .
__bs__ With the help of people like you , we can make this dream a reality .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ And these were the results of the Swedish students .
__bs__ They move up into that corner .
__bs__ And if we look where the income ends up , this is 100 percent the world &apos;s annual income .
__bs__ Here in Uganda , development aid .
__bs__ I can split South Asia here . India &apos;s the big bubble in the middle .
__bs__ But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka .
__bs__ This is Mao Tse-tung . He brought health to China .
__bs__ And to show that , you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates .
__bs__ They came from here , a mineral country .
__bs__ If I split Uganda , there &apos;s quite a difference within Uganda .
__bs__ Everything in this world exists in Africa .
__bs__ Because the data is hidden down in the databases .
__bs__ So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years .
__bs__ We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways .
__bs__ This is the income distribution of the United States , 1970 .
__bs__ Almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it ?
__bs__ I end now with the world .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla basically about 100 years ago .
__bs__ The thought that you wouldn &apos;t want to transfer electric power wirelessly , no one ever thought of that .
__bs__ They thought , &quot; &quot; Who would use it if you didn &apos;t ? &quot; &quot; And so , in fact , he actually set about doing a variety of things .
__bs__ Built the Tesla coil . This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s .
__bs__ And the idea was , it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth .
__bs__ We &apos;ll never know if this stuff worked . Actually , I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes , sometime in the early 1900s .
__bs__ But the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much .
__bs__ I mean , think about how much we love this .
__bs__ If you just walk outside , there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world , putting up wires to get power from where it &apos;s created to where it &apos;s used .
__bs__ The other thing is , we love batteries .
__bs__ And for those of us that have an environmental element to us , there is something like 40 billion disposable batteries built every year for power that , generally speaking , is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power .
__bs__ So , before I got here , I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , I am from North America .
__bs__ We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States . &quot; &quot; So I thought I &apos;d better look it up first .
__bs__ So definition number six is the North American definition of the word &quot; &quot; suck . &quot; &quot; Wires suck , they really do .
__bs__ Think about it . Whether that &apos;s you in that picture or something under your desk .
__bs__ The other thing is , batteries suck too .
__bs__ And they really , really do .
__bs__ Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
__bs__ 40 billion of these things built .
__bs__ This is what happens .
__bs__ They fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
__bs__ So when you talk about expensive power , the cost per kilowatt-hour to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds .
__bs__ Think about that .
__bs__ The most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that .
__bs__ So fortunately , one of the other definitions of &quot; &quot; suck &quot; &quot; that was in there , it does create a vacuum .
__bs__ And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
__bs__ What happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance .
__bs__ Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters .
__bs__ It got about 50 percent of the efficiency — by the way , that &apos;s still a couple thousand times more efficient than a battery would be , to do the same thing .
__bs__ But were able to light that , and do it very successfully .
__bs__ This was actually the experiment . So you can see the coils were somewhat larger .
__bs__ The light bulb was a fairly simple task , from their standpoint .
__bs__ This all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife &apos;s cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power .
__bs__ And he was thinking , &quot; &quot; With all the electricity that &apos;s out there in the walls , why couldn &apos;t some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep ? &quot; &quot; And he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer .
__bs__ But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire .
__bs__ And those two coils of wire are really , really close to each other , and actually do transfer power magnetically and wirelessly , only over a very short distance .
__bs__ What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology , which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .
__bs__ It &apos;s a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award , which is nicknamed the Genius Award , last September , for his discovery .
__bs__ So how does it work ?
__bs__ Imagine a coil . For those of you that are engineers , there &apos;s a capacitor attached to it too .
__bs__ And if you can cause that coil to resonate , what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies — at a fairly high frequency , by the way .
__bs__ And if you can bring another device close enough to the source , that will only work at exactly that frequency , you can actually get them to do what &apos;s called strongly couple , and transfer magnetic energy between them .
__bs__ And then what you do is , you start out with electricity , turn it into magnetic field , take that magnetic field , turn it back into electricity , and then you can use it .
__bs__ Number one question I get asked .
__bs__ I mean , people are worried about cellphones being safe .
__bs__ You know . What about safety ?
__bs__ The first thing is this is not a &quot; &quot; radiative &quot; &quot; technology .
__bs__ It doesn &apos;t radiate .
__bs__ There aren &apos;t electric fields here . It &apos;s a magnetic field .
__bs__ It stays within either what we call the source , or within the device .
__bs__ And actually , the magnetic fields we &apos;re using are basically about the same as the Earth &apos;s magnetic field .
__bs__ We live in a magnetic field .
__bs__ And the other thing that &apos;s pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency .
__bs__ And it &apos;s virtually impossible in nature to make that happen .
__bs__ Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do .
__bs__ They &apos;ve pretty much set field exposure limits , which all of the things in the stuff I &apos;ll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines .
__bs__ Mobile electronics .
__bs__ Home electronics .
__bs__ Those cords under your desk , I bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries .
__bs__ There are industrial applications .
__bs__ And then finally , electric vehicles .
__bs__ These electric cars are beautiful .
__bs__ But who is going to want to plug them in ?
__bs__ Imagine driving into your garage — we &apos;ve built a system to do this — you drive into your garage , and the car charges itself , because there is a mat on the floor that &apos;s plugged into the wall .
__bs__ And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently .
__bs__ Then there &apos;s all kinds of other applications . Implanted medical devices , where people don &apos;t have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up .
__bs__ Credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
__bs__ So what I &apos;d like to do is take a couple minutes and show you , actually , how it works .
__bs__ And what I &apos;m going to do is to show you pretty much what &apos;s here .
__bs__ You &apos;ve got a coil .
__bs__ That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field .
__bs__ We put one on the back of the television set .
__bs__ By the way , I do make it look a little bit easier than it is .
__bs__ There &apos;s lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it .
__bs__ But then what &apos;s going to happen is , it will create a field .
__bs__ It will cause one to get created on the other side .
__bs__ And if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
__bs__ The 10 seconds actually are because we — I don &apos;t know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in when you use just a cord .
__bs__ Generally , you have to go over and hit the button . So I thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to tell it to do that .
__bs__ So , I &apos;ll plug that in .
__bs__ It creates a magnetic field here .
__bs__ It causes one to be created out here .
__bs__ And as I said , in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ...
__bs__ This is a commercially — ( Applause ) available color television set .
__bs__ Imagine , you get one of these things . You want to hang them on the wall .
__bs__ How many people want to hang them on the wall ?
__bs__ Think about it . You don &apos;t want those ugly cords coming down .
__bs__ Imagine if you can get rid of it .
__bs__ The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety .
__bs__ So , there is nothing going on . I &apos;m okay .
__bs__ And I &apos;ll do it again , just for safety &apos;s sake .
__bs__ Almost immediately , though , people ask , &quot; How small can you make this ? Can you make this small enough ? &quot;
__bs__ Because remember Dr. Soljacic &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s cellphone beeping .
__bs__ So , I wanted to show you something .
__bs__ We &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
__bs__ This a Google G1 .
__bs__ You know , it &apos;s the latest thing that &apos;s come out .
__bs__ It runs the Android operating system .
__bs__ I think I heard somebody talk about that before .
__bs__ It &apos;s odd . It has a battery .
__bs__ It also has coiled electronics that WiTricity has put into the back of it .
__bs__ And if I can get the camera — okay , great — you &apos;ll see , as I get sort of close ...
__bs__ you &apos;re looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly .
__bs__ ( Applause ) And I know some of you are Apple aficionados .
__bs__ So , you know they don &apos;t make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones .
__bs__ So we put a little sleeve on the back , but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .
__bs__ And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center .
__bs__ ( Applause ) And Nokia as well .
__bs__ You &apos;ll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back , to do that , and it probably beeps , actually , as it goes on as well .
__bs__ But they typically use it to light up the screen .
__bs__ So , imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling .
__bs__ They could go in the floor . They could go , actually , underneath your desktop .
__bs__ So that when you walk in or you come in from home , if you carry a purse , it works in your purse .
__bs__ You never have to worry about plugging these things in again .
__bs__ And think of what that would do for you .
__bs__ So I think in closing , sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine , I thought I &apos;d put up one more slide .
__bs__ And for those of you who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . &quot;
__bs__ So , thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder , but this is not how I started .
__bs__ When I was seven years old , I remember watching television and seeing people throwing rocks , and thinking , this must be a fun thing to do .
__bs__ So I got out to the street and threw rocks , not realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars .
__bs__ Instead , I ended up stoning my neighbors &apos; cars . ( Laughter ) They were not enthusiastic about my patriotism .
__bs__ This is my picture with my brother .
__bs__ This is me , the little one , and I know what you &apos;re thinking : &quot; You used to look cute , what the heck happened to you ? &quot;
__bs__ But my brother , who is older than me , was arrested when he was 18 , taken to prison on charges of throwing stones .
__bs__ He was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones , and as a result , had internal injuries that caused his death soon after he was released from prison .
__bs__ I was angry , I was bitter , and all I wanted was revenge .
__bs__ But that changed when I was 18 .
__bs__ I decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job , and going to study Hebrew in that classroom was the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers .
__bs__ And we connected over really small things , like the fact that I love country music , which is really strange for Palestinians .
__bs__ But it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger , of hatred and of ignorance that separates us .
__bs__ I decided that it doesn &apos;t matter what happens to me .
__bs__ What really matters is how I deal with it .
__bs__ And therefore , I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people .
__bs__ I do so through many ways .
__bs__ Tourism is one of them , but also media and education , and you might be wondering , really , can tourism change things ?
__bs__ Can it bring down walls ? Yes .
__bs__ Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls and to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other and creating friendships .
__bs__ In 2009 , I cofounded Mejdi Tours , a social enterprise that aims to connect people , with two Jewish friends , by the way , and what we &apos;ll do , the model we did , for example , in Jerusalem , we would have two tour guides , one Israeli and one Palestinian , guiding the trips together , telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different perspectives .
__bs__ By the way , this is my mother . She &apos;s cool .
__bs__ And that &apos;s the Palestinian food called maqluba .
__bs__ It &apos;s the best meal ever .
__bs__ And we &apos;ll eat together .
__bs__ But when we left , both sides , they were crying because they did not want to leave .
__bs__ Three years later , those relationships still exist .
__bs__ Imagine with me if the one billion people who travel internationally every year travel like this , not being taken in the bus from one side to another , from one hotel to another , taking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures , but actually connecting with people .
__bs__ You know , I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K.
__bs__ going to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family , and having their first Friday night dinners , that Sabbath dinner , and eating together hamin , which is a Jewish food , a stew , just having the connection of realizing , after a while , that a hundred years ago , their families came out of the same place in Northern Africa .
__bs__ This is not a photo profile for your Facebook .
__bs__ This is not disaster tourism .
__bs__ This is the future of travel , and I invite you to join me to do that , to change your travel .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Okay , this morning I &apos;m speaking on the question of corruption .
__bs__ And corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself — or , in the case of our context , your friends , your family or your financiers .
__bs__ Okay ? Friends , family and financiers .
__bs__ But we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it , and we have to admit that .
__bs__ We have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it .
__bs__ The first thing is that the big myth , number one , is that in fact it &apos;s not really a crime .
__bs__ When we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country , crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella , nobody &apos;s speaking about corruption .
__bs__ That &apos;s the honest truth .
__bs__ When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime , he isn &apos;t speaking about corruption .
__bs__ And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security is speaking about crime , he &apos;s not talking about corruption either .
__bs__ The point I &apos;m making is that it is a crime .
__bs__ It is an economic crime , because we &apos;re involving the looting of taxpayers &apos; money .
__bs__ Public and private corruption is a reality .
__bs__ As somebody who comes from the private sector , I can tell you there &apos;s a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government .
__bs__ The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table , it all takes place in the private sector .
__bs__ Today , I &apos;m focusing on public sector corruption , which the private sector also participates in .
__bs__ The second important myth to understand — because we have to destroy these myths , dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them — the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem — if it is a problem , it &apos;s only a small problem , that in fact it &apos;s only a little 10 or 15 percent , it &apos;s been going on forever , it probably will continue forever , and there &apos;s no point passing any laws , because there &apos;s little we can do about it .
__bs__ And I want to demonstrate that that , too , is a dangerous myth , very dangerous .
__bs__ It &apos;s a piece of public mischief .
__bs__ And I want to speak a little bit , take us back about 30 years .
__bs__ We &apos;re coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago , a resource-rich , small Caribbean country , and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country &apos;s wealth , and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices .
__bs__ We call them petrodollars . The treasury was bursting with money .
__bs__ And it &apos;s ironic , because we &apos;re standing today in the Central Bank .
__bs__ You see , history &apos;s rich in irony .
__bs__ We &apos;re standing today in the Central Bank , and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I &apos;m going to be speaking about .
__bs__ Okay ? We &apos;re talking about irresponsibility in public office .
__bs__ We &apos;re at jcc.org.tt , and we have the — we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted .
__bs__ So those of you interested in finding out more about it , or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions , please get involved .
__bs__ But I &apos;m going to segue to another thing that relates , because one of my private campaigns I &apos;ve been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of CL Financial .
__bs__ CL Financial is the Caribbean &apos;s largest ever conglomerate , okay ?
__bs__ And without getting into all of the details , it is said to have collapsed — I &apos;m using my words very carefully — it &apos;s said to have collapsed in January of &apos; 09 , which is just coming up to nearly four years .
__bs__ In an unprecedented fit of generosity — and you have to be very suspicious about these people — in an unprecedented — and I &apos;m using that word carefully — unprecedented fit of generosity , the government of the day signed , made a written commitment , to repay all of the creditors .
__bs__ And I can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn &apos;t happened anywhere else on the planet .
__bs__ Let &apos;s understand , because we lack context .
__bs__ People are telling us it &apos;s just like Wall Street . It &apos;s not just like Wall Street .
__bs__ Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something .
__bs__ Here is here , and out there is out there . Okay ?
__bs__ I &apos;m serious now .
__bs__ Listen . They &apos;ve had bailouts on Wall Street .
__bs__ They &apos;ve had bailouts in London .
__bs__ They &apos;ve had bailouts in Europe .
__bs__ In Africa , they &apos;ve had bailouts . In Nigeria , six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours , eh ?
__bs__ It &apos;s interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has — how they &apos;ve treated it , and they &apos;ve treated it very well compared to us .
__bs__ Nowhere on the planet have all the creditors been bailed out in excess of what their statutory entitlements were .
__bs__ Only here . So what was the reason for the generosity ?
__bs__ Is our government that generous ? And maybe they are .
__bs__ Let &apos;s look at it . Let &apos;s look into it .
__bs__ So I started digging and writing and so and so on , and that work can be found , my personal work can be found at AfraRaymond.com , which is my name .
__bs__ It &apos;s a not-for-profit blog that I run .
__bs__ Not as popular as some of the other people , but there you go .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34 , that plot to pervert Parliament , that bitter experience that took place in August , when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence , going into September , forced me to check myself and recalculate my bearings , and to go back into some of the work , some of the stuff I &apos;d written and some of the exchanges I &apos;d had with the officials to see what was really what .
__bs__ As we say in Trinidad and Tobago , who is who and what is what ?
__bs__ Okay ? We want to try to recalculate .
__bs__ And I made a Freedom of Information application in May this year to the Ministry of Finance .
__bs__ The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over .
__bs__ This is the other context .
__bs__ The Ministry of Finance , we are told , is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to take you through a worked example of whether that &apos;s really so .
__bs__ The Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
__bs__ So in fact , you can &apos;t ask them anything , and they don &apos;t have to answer anything .
__bs__ That is the law since 1999 .
__bs__ So I plunged into this struggle , and I asked four questions .
__bs__ And I &apos;ll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply , so you could understand , as I said , where we are .
__bs__ Here is not like anywhere else .
__bs__ Question number one : I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial , and if you can &apos;t show me the accounts — the Minister of Finance is making statements , passing new laws and giving speeches and so on .
__bs__ What are the figures he &apos;s relying on ?
__bs__ It &apos;s like that joke : I want whatever he &apos;s drinking .
__bs__ And they wrote back and said to me , well what do you really mean ?
__bs__ So they hit my question with a question .
__bs__ Second point : I want to see who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid ?
__bs__ Let me pause here to point out to you all that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this .
__bs__ That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars coming out of a small — we used to be resource-rich — Caribbean country . Okay ?
__bs__ And I asked the question , who was getting that three and a half billion dollars ?
__bs__ And I want to pause again to bring up context , because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing .
__bs__ There &apos;s a particular individual who is in the government now .
__bs__ The name of the person doesn &apos;t matter .
__bs__ And that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his political cause .
__bs__ Okay ? His name isn &apos;t important .
__bs__ I wouldn &apos;t dignify it . I &apos;m on a point .
__bs__ The point is , that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause .
__bs__ And the most famous case was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal , where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships , and the scholarships hadn &apos;t been advertised , and so and so on and so on .
__bs__ And he was able to get the court , using that act of Parliament , Freedom of Information Act , to release the information , and I thought that was excellent .
__bs__ Fantastic .
__bs__ But you see , the question is this : If it &apos;s right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act and to use the court to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money , it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars .
__bs__ You see ? But the Ministry of Finance , the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance , wrote me and said to me , that information is exempt too .
__bs__ You see ? This is what we &apos;re dealing with , okay ?
__bs__ The third thing I will tell you is that I also asked for the directors of CL Financial , whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act .
__bs__ We have an Integrity in Public Life Act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation &apos;s interest .
__bs__ And public officials are supposed to file to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities .
__bs__ And of course I &apos;ve since discovered that they &apos;re not filing , and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file .
__bs__ So here we have it . We have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded .
__bs__ I &apos;ve asked the question in the legal and required fashion .
__bs__ It &apos;s been ignored .
__bs__ The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34 , we need to continue to work on that . We can &apos;t forget it .
__bs__ I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country &apos;s history .
__bs__ It &apos;s also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation .
__bs__ And this is my reality check .
__bs__ Where you have an expenditure of public money and it is without accountability and it &apos;s without transparency , it will always be equal to corruption , whether you &apos;re in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska , it will always be equal to corruption , and that is what we are dealing with here .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to continue the work to press on , to get some resolution of those matters at the Ministry of Finance .
__bs__ If it is I have to go to court personally , I will do that .
__bs__ We will continue to press on .
__bs__ We will continue to work within JCC .
__bs__ But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example .
__bs__ We had the journalist &#91; Heather &#93; Brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption , and she introduced me to this website , Alaveteli.com.
__bs__ And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database for Freedom of Information applications , and speak with each other .
__bs__ I could see what you &apos;re applying for .
__bs__ You could see what I applied for and what replies I got .
__bs__ We can work on it together . We need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point .
__bs__ We need to increase the consciousness .
__bs__ The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one , which is a lovely website from India called IPaidABribe.com.
__bs__ They have international branches , and it &apos;s important for us to tune into this one .
__bs__ IPaidABribe.com is really important , a good one to log on to and see .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to pause there . I &apos;m going to ask you for your courage .
__bs__ Discard the first myth ; it is a crime .
__bs__ Discard the second myth ; it is a big thing .
__bs__ It &apos;s a huge problem . It &apos;s an economic crime .
__bs__ And let us continue working together to betterment in this situation , stability and sustainability in our society . Thank you .
__bs__ Raise your hand if you &apos;ve ever been asked the question &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
__bs__ Now if you had to guess , how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question ?
__bs__ You can just hold up fingers .
__bs__ Three . Five . Three . Five . Five . OK .
__bs__ Now , raise your hand if the question &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
__bs__ has ever caused you any anxiety .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Any anxiety at all .
__bs__ I &apos;m someone who &apos;s never been able to answer the question &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
__bs__ See , the problem wasn &apos;t that I didn &apos;t have any interests — it &apos;s that I had too many .
__bs__ In high school , I liked English and math and art and I built websites and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator .
__bs__ Maybe you &apos;ve heard of us .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) This continued after high school , and at a certain point , I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in , become all-consumed , and I &apos;d get to be pretty good at whatever it was , and then I would hit this point where I &apos;d start to get bored .
__bs__ And usually I would try and persist anyway , because I had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field .
__bs__ But eventually this sense of boredom , this feeling of , like , yeah , I got this , this isn &apos;t challenging anymore — it would get to be too much .
__bs__ And I would have to let it go .
__bs__ But then I would become interested in something else , something totally unrelated , and I would dive into that , and become all-consumed , and I &apos;d be like , &quot; &quot; Yes ! I found my thing , &quot; &quot; and then I would hit this point again where I &apos;d start to get bored .
__bs__ And eventually , I would let it go .
__bs__ But then I would discover something new and totally different , and I would dive into that .
__bs__ The first was that I wasn &apos;t sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career .
__bs__ I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing , deny all of my other passions , and just resign myself to being bored .
__bs__ The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal .
__bs__ I worried that there was something wrong with this , and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything .
__bs__ I worried that I was afraid of commitment , or that I was scattered , or that I was self-sabotaging , afraid of my own success .
__bs__ If you can relate to my story and to these feelings , I &apos;d like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then .
__bs__ Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things .
__bs__ I &apos;ll tell you where you learned it : you learned it from the culture .
__bs__ We are first asked the question &quot; &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; &quot; when we &apos;re about five years old .
__bs__ And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you &apos;re that age .
__bs__ But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms — for instance , high school students might get asked what major they &apos;re going to pick in college .
__bs__ And at some point , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
__bs__ goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night .
__bs__ Why ?
__bs__ See , while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be , it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be .
__bs__ In fact , it does just the opposite , because when someone asks you what you want to be , you can &apos;t reply with 20 different things , though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like , &quot; &quot; Oh , how cute , but you can &apos;t be a violin maker and a psychologist .
__bs__ You have to choose . &quot; &quot; This is Dr. Bob Childs — ( Laughter ) and he &apos;s a luthier and psychotherapist .
__bs__ And this is Amy Ng , a magazine editor turned illustrator , entrepreneur , teacher and creative director .
__bs__ But most kids don &apos;t hear about people like this .
__bs__ All they hear is that they &apos;re going to have to choose .
__bs__ But it &apos;s more than that .
__bs__ The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture .
__bs__ But what if you &apos;re someone who isn &apos;t wired this way ?
__bs__ What if there are a lot of different subjects that you &apos;re curious about , and many different things you want to do ?
__bs__ Well , there is no room for someone like you in this framework .
__bs__ And so you might feel alone .
__bs__ You might feel like you don &apos;t have a purpose .
__bs__ And you might feel like there &apos;s something wrong with you .
__bs__ There &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
__bs__ What you are is a multipotentialite .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits .
__bs__ It &apos;s a mouthful to say .
__bs__ It might help if you break it up into three parts : multi , potential , and ite .
__bs__ You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea , such as polymath , the Renaissance person .
__bs__ Actually , during the Renaissance period , it was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines .
__bs__ Barbara Sher refers to us as &quot; &quot; scanners . &quot; &quot; Use whichever term you like , or invent your own .
__bs__ I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community , we cannot agree on a single identity .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome .
__bs__ But what I &apos;ve learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way .
__bs__ Here are three multipotentialite super powers .
__bs__ One : idea synthesis .
__bs__ That is , combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection .
__bs__ Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography , data visualization , travel , mathematics and design , when they founded Meshu .
__bs__ Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry .
__bs__ Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite , but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences .
__bs__ Innovation happens at the intersections .
__bs__ That &apos;s where the new ideas come from .
__bs__ And multipotentialites , with all of their backgrounds , are able to access a lot of these points of intersection .
__bs__ The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning .
__bs__ When multipotentialites become interested in something , we go hard .
__bs__ We observe everything we can get our hands on .
__bs__ We &apos;re also used to being beginners , because we &apos;ve been beginners so many times in the past , and this means that we &apos;re less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones .
__bs__ What &apos;s more , many skills are transferable across disciplines , and we bring everything we &apos;ve learned to every new area we pursue , so we &apos;re rarely starting from scratch .
__bs__ Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer .
__bs__ As a child concert pianist , she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory .
__bs__ Now , she &apos;s the fastest typist she knows .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Before becoming a writer , Nora was a financial planner .
__bs__ She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice , and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors .
__bs__ It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you &apos;re drawn to , even if you end up quitting .
__bs__ You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely , in a way that you couldn &apos;t have anticipated .
__bs__ The third multipotentialite superpower is adaptability ; that is , the ability to morph into whatever you need to be in a given situation .
__bs__ Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director , sometimes a web designer , sometimes a Kickstarter consultant , sometimes a teacher , and sometimes , apparently , James Bond .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) He &apos;s valuable because he does good work .
__bs__ He &apos;s even more valuable because he can take on various roles , depending on his clients &apos; needs .
__bs__ Fast Company magazine identified adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the 21st century .
__bs__ The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive .
__bs__ Idea synthesis , rapid learning and adaptability : three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at , and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus .
__bs__ As a society , we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves .
__bs__ We have a lot of complex , multidimensional problems in the world right now , and we need creative , out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them .
__bs__ Now , let &apos;s say that you are , in your heart , a specialist .
__bs__ You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon .
__bs__ Don &apos;t worry — there &apos;s nothing wrong with you , either .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) In fact , some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together .
__bs__ The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas , while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project .
__bs__ It &apos;s a beautiful partnership .
__bs__ But we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we &apos;re wired .
__bs__ And sadly , multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers .
__bs__ So with that said , if there is one thing you take away from this talk , I hope that it is this : embrace your inner wiring , whatever that may be .
__bs__ If you &apos;re a specialist at heart , then by all means , specialize .
__bs__ That is where you &apos;ll do your best work .
__bs__ But to the multipotentialites in the room , including those of you who may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one — ( Laughter ) to you I say : embrace your many passions .
__bs__ Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes .
__bs__ Explore your intersections .
__bs__ Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier , more authentic life .
__bs__ And perhaps more importantly — multipotentialites , the world needs us .
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired .
__bs__ I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I &apos;m writing anything , but I &apos;d already finished editing the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; &quot; disabled &quot; &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
__bs__ Let me read you the entry .
__bs__ &quot; &quot; Disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run-down , worn-out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid-up , done-up , done-for , done-in cracked-up , counted-out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
__bs__ Antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot; &quot; I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but I &apos;d just gotten past &quot; &quot; mangled , &quot; &quot; and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
__bs__ You know , of course , this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
__bs__ But , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
__bs__ And , needless to say , thank God I wasn &apos;t using a thesaurus back then .
__bs__ I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
__bs__ So , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting .
__bs__ Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
__bs__ Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
__bs__ I find the last two words under &quot; &quot; Near Antonyms , &quot; &quot; particularly unsettling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wholesome . &quot;
__bs__ So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
__bs__ It &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
__bs__ It &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
__bs__ Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
__bs__ In fact , many ancient societies , including the Greeks and the Romans , believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
__bs__ So , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s empowered ?
__bs__ By casually doing something as simple as naming a person , a child , we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power .
__bs__ Wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
__bs__ One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
__bs__ His name was Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce , so he went by Dr. P.
__bs__ And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
__bs__ I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
__bs__ I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands — different colors , you know — to help build up my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything — I hated them , had names for them . I hated them .
__bs__ And , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
__bs__ And , one day , he came in to my session — exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions — and he said to me , &quot; &quot; Wow . Aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
__bs__ When you do break it , I &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot; &quot; Now , of course , this was a simple ploy on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
__bs__ And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
__bs__ This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
__bs__ But , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
__bs__ Our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
__bs__ Certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them — not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
__bs__ So , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
__bs__ The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I &apos;m going to make an admission : This phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
__bs__ Implicit in this phrase of &quot; &quot; overcoming adversity &quot; &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
__bs__ But , in fact , we are changed . We are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
__bs__ And I &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
__bs__ Adversity isn &apos;t an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
__bs__ It &apos;s part of our life .
__bs__ And I tend to think of it like my shadow .
__bs__ Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
__bs__ And , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
__bs__ There is adversity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet adversity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
__bs__ So , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
__bs__ And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
__bs__ There &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I &apos;m disabled .
__bs__ And , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability I &apos;ve had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions .
__bs__ In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
__bs__ Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
__bs__ By not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
__bs__ We are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
__bs__ So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
__bs__ And , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
__bs__ So it &apos;s not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity .
__bs__ So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
__bs__ And , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less burdened by the presence of it .
__bs__ This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character .
__bs__ To paraphrase : It &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change .
__bs__ Conflict is the genesis of creation .
__bs__ From Darwin &apos;s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
__bs__ So , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
__bs__ And , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
__bs__ Maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
__bs__ So , we can give ourselves a gift .
__bs__ We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
__bs__ Maybe we can see it as change .
__bs__ Adversity is just change that we haven &apos;t adapted ourselves to yet .
__bs__ I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
__bs__ Now , who &apos;s normal ?
__bs__ There &apos;s no normal .
__bs__ There &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . There &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t think so .
__bs__ If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility — or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous — we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
__bs__ Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
__bs__ There &apos;s evidence that Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
__bs__ They didn &apos;t view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
__bs__ A few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes .
__bs__ It was summertime : I had shorts on .
__bs__ I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t Aimee Mullins . &quot; &quot; And I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . I have no idea who he is .
__bs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
__bs__ I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother &apos;s womb . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Oh , that guy .
__bs__ And , but of course , actually , it did click .
__bs__ This man was Dr. Kean , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
__bs__ And so my mother &apos;s prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
__bs__ And , because I was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer — this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
__bs__ He said to me , &quot; &quot; I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students ,
__bs__ med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
__bs__ And he called this part of the course the X Factor , the potential of the human will .
__bs__ No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
__bs__ And Dr. Kean went on to tell me , he said , &quot; &quot; In my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot; &quot; See , Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking .
__bs__ He understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
__bs__ And there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs , I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second .
__bs__ I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
__bs__ But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
__bs__ And it &apos;s because of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them , not in spite of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them .
__bs__ And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
__bs__ See , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
__bs__ If you can hand somebody the key to their own power — the human spirit is so receptive — if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
__bs__ You &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
__bs__ In fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; &quot; educate &quot; &quot; comes from the root word &quot; &quot; educe . &quot; &quot; It means &quot; &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot; &quot; So again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
__bs__ There was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .
__bs__ It &apos;s called the streaming trials . We call it &quot; &quot; tracking &quot; &quot; here in the States .
__bs__ It &apos;s separating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
__bs__ And the &quot; &quot; A students &quot; &quot; get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
__bs__ Well , they took , over a three-month period , D-level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at A-level .
__bs__ And , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; &quot; A students &quot; &quot; and told them they were &quot; &quot; D &apos;s . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
__bs__ Those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
__bs__ A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
__bs__ The teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
__bs__ They were simply told , &quot; &quot; These are the &apos; A-students , &apos; these are the &apos; D-students . &apos; &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
__bs__ So , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
__bs__ If instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well .
__bs__ When a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
__bs__ I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend , Jacques Dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; &quot; The God Who Only Knows Four Words &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; Every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don &apos;ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , &apos; Come dance with me .
__bs__ Come , dance with me . Come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m here because I have a very important message : I think we have found the most important factor for success .
__bs__ And it was found close to here , Stanford .
__bs__ Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves .
__bs__ And he would tell the child , a four-year-old kid , &quot; &quot; Johnny , I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for 15 minutes .
__bs__ If , after I come back , this marshmallow is here , you will get another one . So you will have two . &quot; &quot; To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes for something that they like , is equivalent to telling us , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll bring you coffee in two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Exact equivalent .
__bs__ So what happened when the professor left the room ?
__bs__ As soon as the door closed ...
__bs__ two out of three ate the marshmallow .
__bs__ Five seconds , 10 seconds , 40 seconds , 50 seconds , two minutes , four minutes , eight minutes .
__bs__ Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
__bs__ What &apos;s interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...
__bs__ Would look at it .
__bs__ Put it back .
__bs__ They would walk around . They would play with their skirts and pants .
__bs__ That child already , at four , understood the most important principle for success , which is the ability to delay gratification .
__bs__ Self-discipline : the most important factor for success .
__bs__ 15 years later , 14 or 15 years later , follow-up study .
__bs__ What did they find ?
__bs__ They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19 .
__bs__ And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful .
__bs__ They had good grades . They were doing wonderful .
__bs__ They were happy . They had their plans .
__bs__ They had good relationships with the teachers , students .
__bs__ They were doing fine .
__bs__ A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble .
__bs__ They did not make it to university .
__bs__ They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
__bs__ A few were still there with bad grades .
__bs__ A few had good grades .
__bs__ I had a question in my mind : Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids ?
__bs__ So I went to Colombia . And I reproduced the experiment .
__bs__ And it was very funny . I used four , five and six years old kids .
__bs__ And let me show you what happened .
__bs__ ( Spanish ) ( Laughter ) So what happened in Colombia ?
__bs__ Hispanic kids , two out of three ate the marshmallow ; one out of three did not .
__bs__ This little girl was interesting ; she ate the inside of the marshmallow .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) In other words , she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it , so she would get two .
__bs__ But she ate it .
__bs__ So we know she &apos;ll be successful . But we have to watch her .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) She should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register .
__bs__ But she will be successful .
__bs__ And this applies for everything . Even in sales .
__bs__ The sales person that — the customer says , &quot; &quot; I want that . &quot; &quot; And the person says , &quot; &quot; Okay , here you are . &quot; &quot; That person ate the marshmallow .
__bs__ If the sales person says , &quot; &quot; Wait a second .
__bs__ Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . &quot; &quot; Then you sell a lot more .
__bs__ So this has applications in all walks of life .
__bs__ I end with — the Koreans did this .
__bs__ You know what ? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children .
__bs__ We did one for children . And now it is all over Korea .
__bs__ They are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
__bs__ And we need to learn that principle here in the States , because we have a big debt .
__bs__ We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
__bs__ Thank you so much .
__bs__ Well , this is 2009 .
__bs__ And it &apos;s the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin .
__bs__ And all over the world , eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this .
__bs__ And what they &apos;re planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life , and how he changed our thinking .
__bs__ I say almost every aspect , because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on .
__bs__ And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else .
__bs__ So I &apos;m going to talk about it .
__bs__ It &apos;s the question of , why are we so different from the chimpanzees ?
__bs__ We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related — hardly any genes of difference , very , very closely related .
__bs__ And yet , when you look at the phenotypes , there &apos;s a chimp , there &apos;s a man ; they &apos;re astoundingly different , no resemblance at all .
__bs__ I &apos;m not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology , or behavior .
__bs__ I &apos;m talking about ground-base , nitty-gritty , measurable physical differences .
__bs__ They , that one , is hairy and walking on four legs .
__bs__ That one is a naked biped . Why ?
__bs__ I mean — ( Laughter ) if I &apos;m a good Darwinist , I &apos;ve got to believe there &apos;s a reason for that .
__bs__ If we changed so much , something must have happened .
__bs__ What happened ?
__bs__ Now 50 years ago , that was a laughably simple question .
__bs__ Everybody knew the answer .
__bs__ They knew what happened .
__bs__ The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees ; our ancestors went out onto the plain .
__bs__ That explained everything .
__bs__ We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass , or to chase after animals , or to free our hands for weapons .
__bs__ And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away .
__bs__ Everybody knew that , for generations .
__bs__ But then , in the &apos; 90s , something began to unravel .
__bs__ The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids .
__bs__ And they weren &apos;t savanna species .
__bs__ And they looked at the herbivores . And they weren &apos;t savanna herbivores .
__bs__ And then they were so clever , they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen .
__bs__ Shock , horror .
__bs__ The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation .
__bs__ Some of it even came from lianas , those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle .
__bs__ So we &apos;re left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees , before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence .
__bs__ This is not something I &apos;ve made up .
__bs__ It &apos;s not a minority theory .
__bs__ Everybody agrees with it .
__bs__ Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London .
__bs__ He said , &quot; &quot; Everything I &apos;ve been telling you for the last 20 years , forget about it . It was wrong .
__bs__ We &apos;ve got to go back to square one and start again . &quot; &quot; It made him very unpopular . They didn &apos;t want to go back to square one .
__bs__ I mean , it &apos;s a terrible thing to happen .
__bs__ You &apos;ve got this beautiful paradigm .
__bs__ You &apos;ve believed it through generations .
__bs__ Nobody has questioned it .
__bs__ You &apos;ve been constructing fanciful things on top of it , relying on it to be as solid as a rock .
__bs__ And now it &apos;s whipped away from under you .
__bs__ What do you do ? What does a scientist do in that case ?
__bs__ Well , we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962 .
__bs__ He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is , guess what — they carry on as if nothing had happened .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) If they haven &apos;t got a paradigm they can &apos;t ask the question .
__bs__ So they say , &quot; &quot; Yes it &apos;s wrong , but supposing it was right ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions .
__bs__ So that is what they have done now .
__bs__ That &apos;s why you don &apos;t hear them talking about it . It &apos;s yesterday &apos;s question .
__bs__ Some of them have even elevated it into a principle .
__bs__ It &apos;s what we ought to be doing .
__bs__ Aaron Filler from Harvard said , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t it time we stopped talking about selective pressures ?
__bs__ I mean , why don &apos;t we talk about , well , there &apos;s chromosomes , and there &apos;s genes .
__bs__ And we just record what we see . &quot; &quot; Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave !
__bs__ He knew all about that kind of science .
__bs__ And he called it hypothesis-free science .
__bs__ And he despised it from the bottom of his heart .
__bs__ And if you &apos;re going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to stop talking about selective pressures , &quot; you can take &quot; &quot; The Origin of Species &quot; &quot; and throw it out of the window , for it &apos;s about nothing else but selective pressures .
__bs__ And the irony of it is , that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn &apos;t have to wait for a new paradigm to come up .
__bs__ There was one waiting in the wings .
__bs__ It had been waiting there since 1960 when Alister Hardy , a marine biologist , said , &quot; &quot; I think what happened , perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time . &quot; &quot; He kept it to himself for 30 years .
__bs__ But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose .
__bs__ All his colleagues said , &quot; &quot; This is outrageous .
__bs__ You &apos;ve exposed us to public ridicule !
__bs__ You must never do that again . &quot; &quot; And at that time , it became set in stone : the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis , as part of the lunatic fringe of science .
__bs__ Well I don &apos;t think that .
__bs__ I think that Hardy had a lot going for him .
__bs__ I &apos;d like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind , the things that made us different from everybody else , and all our relatives .
__bs__ Let &apos;s look at our naked skin .
__bs__ It &apos;s obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair , mammals without body hair , are aquatic ones , like the dugong , the walrus , the dolphin , the hippopotamus , the manatee .
__bs__ And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa .
__bs__ And you &apos;re tempted to think , well perhaps , could that be why we are naked ?
__bs__ I suggested it and people said , &quot; &quot; No no no .
__bs__ I mean , look at the elephant .
__bs__ You &apos;ve forgotten all about the elephant haven &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; So back in 1982 I said , &quot; Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor . &quot;
__bs__ Peals of merry laughter !
__bs__ &quot; That crazy woman . She &apos;s off again . She &apos;ll say anything won &apos;t she ? &quot;
__bs__ But by now , everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor .
__bs__ This has come &apos; round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .
__bs__ The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros .
__bs__ Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said , &quot; &quot; Seems to have spent most of its time in the water . &quot; &quot; So this is a close connection between nakedness and water .
__bs__ As an absolute connection , it only works one way .
__bs__ You can &apos;t say all aquatic animals are naked , because look at the sea otter .
__bs__ But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water , in its own lifetime , or the lifetime of its ancestors . I think this is significant .
__bs__ The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground .
__bs__ And take bipedality .
__bs__ Here you can &apos;t find anybody to compare it with , because we &apos;re the only animal that walks upright on two legs .
__bs__ But you can say this : all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs , if they want to , for a short time .
__bs__ There is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are wading through water .
__bs__ Do you think that &apos;s significant ?
__bs__ David Attenborough thinks it &apos;s significant , as the possible beginning of our bipedalism .
__bs__ Look at the fat layer .
__bs__ We have got , under our skin , a layer of fat , all over : nothing in the least like that in any other primate .
__bs__ Why should it be there ?
__bs__ Well they do know , that if you look at other aquatic mammals , the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall , around the kidneys and the intestines and so on , has started to migrate to the outside , and spread out in a layer inside the skin .
__bs__ In the whale it &apos;s complete : no fat inside at all , all in blubber outside .
__bs__ We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it &apos;s started to happen .
__bs__ We have got skin lined with this layer .
__bs__ It &apos;s the only possible explanation of why humans , if they &apos;re very unlucky , can become grossly obese , in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate , physically impossible .
__bs__ Something very odd , matter-of-factly , never explained .
__bs__ The question of why we can speak .
__bs__ We can speak .
__bs__ And the gorilla can &apos;t speak . Why ?
__bs__ Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that — purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath .
__bs__ You can &apos;t even train a gorilla to say &quot; &quot; Ah &quot; &quot; on request .
__bs__ The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds .
__bs__ It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak .
__bs__ And then again , there is the fact that we are streamlined .
__bs__ Trying to imagine a diver diving into water — hardly makes a splash .
__bs__ Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver , and you can see that , compared with gorilla , we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .
__bs__ I am trying to suggest that , for 40-odd years , this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe , and it is not lunatic fringe .
__bs__ And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own , which they &apos;ve all agreed on , and they love .
__bs__ There is nothing there .
__bs__ They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) How do they react when I say these things ?
__bs__ One very common reaction I &apos;ve heard about 20 times is , &quot; &quot; But it was investigated .
__bs__ They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning , when Hardy put forward his article . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe it .
__bs__ For 35 years I &apos;ve been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind , and I &apos;ve concluded that that &apos;s one of the urban myths .
__bs__ It &apos;s never been done .
__bs__ I ask people sometimes , and they say , &quot; &quot; I like the aquatic theory !
__bs__ Everybody likes the aquatic theory .
__bs__ Of course they don &apos;t believe it , but they like it . &quot; &quot; Well I say , &quot; &quot; Why do you think it &apos;s rubbish ? &quot; &quot; They say &quot; &quot; Well ...
__bs__ everybody I talk to says it &apos;s rubbish .
__bs__ And they can &apos;t all be wrong , can they ? &quot; &quot; The answer to that , loud and clear , is , &quot; &quot; Yes ! They can all be wrong . &quot; &quot; History is strewn with the cases when they &apos;ve all got it wrong .
__bs__ ( Applause ) And if you &apos;ve got a scientific problem like that , you can &apos;t solve it by holding a head count , and saying , &quot; &quot; More of us say yes than say no . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Apart from that , some of the heads count more than others .
__bs__ Some of them have come over .
__bs__ There was Professor Tobias . He &apos;s come over .
__bs__ Daniel Dennett , he &apos;s come over .
__bs__ Sir David Attenborough , he &apos;s come over .
__bs__ Anybody else out there ? Come on in .
__bs__ The water is lovely .
__bs__ ( Applause ) And now we &apos;ve got to look to the future .
__bs__ Ultimately one of three things is going to happen .
__bs__ Either they will go on for the next 40 years , 50 years , 60 years .
__bs__ &quot; Yeah well we don &apos;t talk about that . Let &apos;s talk about something interesting . &quot;
__bs__ That would be very sad .
__bs__ The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive , and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve found it .
__bs__ It was not the savanna , it was not the water , it was this ! &quot; &quot; No sign of that happening either .
__bs__ I don &apos;t think there is a third option .
__bs__ So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .
__bs__ If you look back at the early years of the last century , there was a stand-off , a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel , and the believers in Darwin .
__bs__ It ended with a new synthesis : Darwin &apos;s ideas and Mendel &apos;s ideas blending together .
__bs__ And I think the same thing will happen here .
__bs__ You &apos;ll get a new synthesis .
__bs__ Hardy &apos;s ideas and Darwin &apos;s ideas will be blended together .
__bs__ And we can move forward from there , and really get somewhere .
__bs__ That would be a beautiful thing .
__bs__ It would be very nice for me if it happened soon .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m older now than George Burns was when he said , &quot; At my age , I don &apos;t even buy green bananas . &quot; ( Laughter )
__bs__ So if it &apos;s going to come and it &apos;s going to happen , what &apos;s holding it up ?
__bs__ I can tell you that in three words .
__bs__ Academia says no .
__bs__ They decided in 1960 , &quot; That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis . &quot;
__bs__ And it &apos;s not easy to change their minds .
__bs__ The professional journals won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
__bs__ The textbooks don &apos;t mention it .
__bs__ The syllabus doesn &apos;t mention even the fact that we &apos;re naked , let alone look for a reason to it .
__bs__ &quot; &quot; Horizon , &quot; &quot; which takes its cue from the academics , won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
__bs__ So we never hear the case put for it , except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe .
__bs__ I don &apos;t know quite where this diktat comes from .
__bs__ Somebody up there is issuing the commandment , &quot; &quot; Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory .
__bs__ And if you hope to make progress in this profession , and you do believe it , you &apos;d better keep it to yourself , because it will get in your way . &quot; &quot; So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood .
__bs__ But you know , that makes me feel good , because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) He says , &quot; &quot; Firstly , you &apos;ve got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it &apos;s been trained to receive . &quot; &quot; Right . I &apos;ll go ahead with that .
__bs__ And secondly , he says , &quot; You must never be afraid to rock the boat . &quot;
__bs__ I &apos;ll go along with that too .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m an underwater explorer , more specifically a cave diver .
__bs__ I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid , but growing up in Canada as a young girl , that wasn &apos;t really available to me .
__bs__ But as it turns out , we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet , the very lifeblood of Mother Earth .
__bs__ So I decided to do something that was even more remarkable .
__bs__ Instead of exploring outer space , I wanted to explore the wonders of inner space .
__bs__ Now , a lot of people will tell you that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors .
__bs__ I mean , imagine yourself here in this room , if you were suddenly plunged into blackness , with your only job to find the exit , sometimes swimming through these large spaces , and at other times crawling beneath the seats , following a thin guideline , just waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath .
__bs__ Well , that &apos;s my workplace .
__bs__ But what I want to teach you today is that our world is not one big solid rock .
__bs__ It &apos;s a whole lot more like a sponge .
__bs__ I can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth &apos;s sponge , but where I can &apos;t , other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me .
__bs__ And my voice is the one that &apos;s going to teach you about the inside of Mother Earth .
__bs__ There was no guidebook available to me when I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs .
__bs__ In 2000 , this was the largest moving object on the planet .
__bs__ It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf , and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology and search for life-forms beneath the ice .
__bs__ We use a technology called rebreathers .
__bs__ It &apos;s an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks .
__bs__ This technology enables us to go deeper than we could &apos;ve imagined even 10 years ago .
__bs__ We use exotic gases , and we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater .
__bs__ I work with biologists .
__bs__ It turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms , species that we never knew existed before .
__bs__ Many of these life-forms live in unusual ways .
__bs__ They have no pigment and no eyes in many cases , and these animals are also extremely long-lived .
__bs__ In fact , animals swimming in these caves today are identical in the fossil record that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs .
__bs__ So imagine that : these are like little swimming dinosaurs .
__bs__ What can they teach us about evolution and survival ?
__bs__ When we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar , he has giant fangs with venom .
__bs__ He can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it .
__bs__ If he were the size of a cat , he &apos;d be the most dangerous thing on our planet .
__bs__ And these animals live in remarkably beautiful places , and in some cases , caves like this , that are very young , yet the animals are ancient .
__bs__ How did they get there ?
__bs__ I also work with physicists , and they &apos;re interested oftentimes in global climate change .
__bs__ They can take rocks within the caves , and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks , much like the rings of a tree , and they can count back in history and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times .
__bs__ The red that you see in this photograph is actually dust from the Sahara Desert .
__bs__ So it &apos;s been picked up by wind , blown across the Atlantic Ocean .
__bs__ It &apos;s rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas .
__bs__ It soaks in through the ground and deposits itself in the rocks within these caves .
__bs__ And when we look back in the layers of these rocks , we can find times when the climate was very , very dry on earth , and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years .
__bs__ Paleoclimatologists are also interested in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth .
__bs__ Here in Bermuda , my team and I embarked on the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region , and we were looking for places where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline , many hundreds of feet below current levels .
__bs__ I also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists .
__bs__ In places like Mexico , in the Bahamas , and even in Cuba , we &apos;re looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves , and they tell us a lot about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions .
__bs__ But my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago , when I was a part of the team that made the very first accurate , three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface .
__bs__ This device that I &apos;m driving through the cave was actually creating a three-dimensional model as we drove it .
__bs__ We also used ultra low frequency radio to broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave .
__bs__ So I swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses , and even under a Sonny &apos;s BBQ Restaurant , Pretty remarkable , and what that taught me was that everything we do on the surface of our earth will be returned to us to drink .
__bs__ Our water planet is not just rivers , lakes and oceans , but it &apos;s this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together .
__bs__ It &apos;s a shared resource from which we all drink .
__bs__ And when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet , then we &apos;ll be working on the problem that &apos;s probably the most important issue of this century .
__bs__ So I never got to be that astronaut that I always wanted to be , but this mapping device , designed by Dr. Bill Stone , will be .
__bs__ It &apos;s actually morphed .
__bs__ It &apos;s now a self-swimming autonomous robot , artificially intelligent , and its ultimate goal is to go to Jupiter &apos;s moon Europa and explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that body .
__bs__ And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ We &apos;re all one family .
__bs__ It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
__bs__ Let me give you just a story , an example .
__bs__ How could we possibly go to the balcony ?
__bs__ But it &apos;s not just what he stood for , it &apos;s what his message was .
__bs__ Now , it &apos;s not enough just to tell a story .
__bs__ And that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
__bs__ That &apos;s why in negotiations , often , when things get tough , people go for walks in the woods .
__bs__ And this woman right here , Um Ahmad , is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan .
__bs__ That &apos;s walking Abraham &apos;s Path .
__bs__ I love a great mystery , and I &apos;m fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science , perhaps because it &apos;s personal .
__bs__ It &apos;s about who we are , and I can &apos;t help but be curious .
__bs__ The mystery is this : What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences , such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet ?
__bs__ Now , this mystery is not new .
__bs__ In 1868 , Thomas Huxley wrote , &quot; &quot; How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp . &quot; &quot; Now , Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated , but he didn &apos;t know why .
__bs__ To the science of his day , it was a mystery .
__bs__ In the years since Huxley , science has learned a lot about brain activity , but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery .
__bs__ Why ? Why have we made so little progress ?
__bs__ Well , some experts think that we can &apos;t solve this problem because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence .
__bs__ We don &apos;t expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics , and as it happens , we can &apos;t expect our species to solve this problem either .
__bs__ Well , I disagree . I &apos;m more optimistic .
__bs__ I think we &apos;ve simply made a false assumption .
__bs__ Once we fix it , we just might solve this problem .
__bs__ Today , I &apos;d like tell you what that assumption is , why it &apos;s false , and how to fix it .
__bs__ Let &apos;s begin with a question : Do we see reality as it is ?
__bs__ I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away .
__bs__ As a result , I come to believe that in reality , there &apos;s a red tomato a meter away .
__bs__ I then close my eyes , and my experience changes to a gray field , but is it still the case that in reality , there &apos;s a red tomato a meter away ?
__bs__ I think so , but could I be wrong ?
__bs__ Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions ?
__bs__ We have misinterpreted our perceptions before .
__bs__ We used to think the Earth is flat , because it looks that way .
__bs__ Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong .
__bs__ Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe , again because it looks that way .
__bs__ Copernicus and Galileo discovered , again , that we were wrong .
__bs__ Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways .
__bs__ He wrote : &quot; &quot; I think that tastes , odors , colors , and so on reside in consciousness .
__bs__ Hence if the living creature were removed , all these qualities would be annihilated . &quot; &quot; Now , that &apos;s a stunning claim .
__bs__ Could Galileo be right ?
__bs__ Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly ?
__bs__ What does modern science have to say about this ?
__bs__ Well , neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain &apos;s cortex is engaged in vision .
__bs__ When you simply open your eyes and look about this room , billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged .
__bs__ Now , this is a bit surprising , because to the extent that we think about vision at all , we think of it as like a camera .
__bs__ It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is .
__bs__ Now , there is a part of vision that &apos;s like a camera : the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are 130 million photoreceptors , so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera .
__bs__ But that doesn &apos;t explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision .
__bs__ What are these neurons up to ?
__bs__ Well , neuroscientists tell us that they are creating , in real time , all the shapes , objects , colors , and motions that we see .
__bs__ It feels like we &apos;re just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is , but in fact , we &apos;re constructing everything that we see .
__bs__ We don &apos;t construct the whole world at once .
__bs__ We construct what we need in the moment .
__bs__ Now , there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see .
__bs__ I &apos;ll just show you two .
__bs__ In this example , you see some red discs with bits cut out of them , but if I just rotate the disks a little bit , suddenly , you see a 3D cube pop out of the screen .
__bs__ Now , the screen of course is flat , so the three-dimensional cube that you &apos;re experiencing must be your construction .
__bs__ In this next example , you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots .
__bs__ In fact , no dots move .
__bs__ All I &apos;m doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue .
__bs__ But when I do this quickly , your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion .
__bs__ There are many more examples , but these are just two that you construct what you see .
__bs__ But neuroscientists go further .
__bs__ They say that we reconstruct reality .
__bs__ So , when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato , that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if I weren &apos;t looking .
__bs__ Now , why would neuroscientists say that we don &apos;t just construct , we reconstruct ?
__bs__ Well , the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one .
__bs__ Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately , and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes .
__bs__ We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately , and so we can be confident that , in the normal case , our perceptions are accurate .
__bs__ You see this in the standard textbooks .
__bs__ One textbook says , for example , &quot; &quot; Evolutionarily speaking , vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate . &quot; &quot; So the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions .
__bs__ They give you a survival advantage .
__bs__ Now , is this correct ?
__bs__ Is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory ?
__bs__ Well , let &apos;s first look at a couple of examples in nature .
__bs__ The Australian jewel beetle is dimpled , glossy and brown .
__bs__ The female is flightless .
__bs__ The male flies , looking , of course , for a hot female .
__bs__ When he finds one , he alights and mates .
__bs__ There &apos;s another species in the outback , Homo sapiens .
__bs__ The male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And when he finds one , he drains it , and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback .
__bs__ Now , as it happens , these bottles are dimpled , glossy , and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles .
__bs__ The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate .
__bs__ They lose all interest in the real females .
__bs__ Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The species almost went extinct .
__bs__ Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Now , the males had successfully found females for thousands , perhaps millions of years .
__bs__ It looked like they saw reality as it is , but apparently not .
__bs__ Evolution had given them a hack .
__bs__ A female is anything dimpled , glossy and brown , the bigger the better .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Even when crawling all over the bottle , the male couldn &apos;t discover his mistake .
__bs__ Now , you might say , beetles , sure , they &apos;re very simple creatures , but surely not mammals .
__bs__ Mammals don &apos;t rely on tricks .
__bs__ Well , I won &apos;t dwell on this , but you get the idea . ( Laughter ) So this raises an important technical question : Does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is ?
__bs__ Fortunately , we don &apos;t have to wave our hands and guess ; evolution is a mathematically precise theory .
__bs__ We can use the equations of evolution to check this out .
__bs__ We can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive , which sensory systems are more fit .
__bs__ A key notion in those equations is fitness .
__bs__ Consider this steak : What does this steak do for the fitness of an animal ?
__bs__ Well , for a hungry lion looking to eat , it enhances fitness .
__bs__ For a well-fed lion looking to mate , it doesn &apos;t enhance fitness .
__bs__ And for a rabbit in any state , it doesn &apos;t enhance fitness , so fitness does depend on reality as it is , yes , but also on the organism , its state and its action .
__bs__ Fitness is not the same thing as reality as it is , and it &apos;s fitness , and not reality as it is , that figures centrally in the equations of evolution .
__bs__ So , in my lab , we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different randomly chosen worlds and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds .
__bs__ Some of the organisms see all of the reality , others see just part of the reality , and some see none of the reality , only fitness .
__bs__ Who wins ?
__bs__ Well , I hate to break it to you , but perception of reality goes extinct .
__bs__ In almost every simulation , organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is .
__bs__ So the bottom line is , evolution does not favor veridical , or accurate perceptions .
__bs__ Those perceptions of reality go extinct .
__bs__ Now , this is a bit stunning .
__bs__ How can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage ?
__bs__ That is a bit counterintuitive .
__bs__ But remember the jewel beetle .
__bs__ The jewel beetle survived for thousands , perhaps millions of years , using simple tricks and hacks .
__bs__ What the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms , including us , are in the same boat as the jewel beetle .
__bs__ We do not see reality as it is .
__bs__ We &apos;re shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive .
__bs__ Still , we need some help with our intuitions .
__bs__ How can not perceiving reality as it is be useful ?
__bs__ Well , fortunately , we have a very helpful metaphor : the desktop interface on your computer .
__bs__ Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you &apos;re writing .
__bs__ Now , the icon is blue and rectangular and in the lower right corner of the desktop .
__bs__ Does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue , rectangular , and in the lower right-hand corner of the computer ?
__bs__ Of course not .
__bs__ Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface .
__bs__ It &apos;s not there to show you the reality of the computer .
__bs__ In fact , it &apos;s there to hide that reality .
__bs__ You don &apos;t want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software .
__bs__ If you had to deal with that , you could never write your text file or edit your photo .
__bs__ So the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior .
__bs__ Space and time , as you perceive them right now , are your desktop .
__bs__ Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop .
__bs__ There &apos;s an obvious objection .
__bs__ Hoffman , if you think that train coming down the track at 200 MPH is just an icon of your desktop , why don &apos;t you step in front of it ?
__bs__ And after you &apos;re gone , and your theory with you , we &apos;ll know that there &apos;s more to that train than just an icon .
__bs__ Well , I wouldn &apos;t step in front of that train for the same reason that I wouldn &apos;t carelessly drag that icon to the trash can : not because I take the icon literally — the file is not literally blue or rectangular — but I do take it seriously .
__bs__ I could lose weeks of work .
__bs__ Similarly , evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive .
__bs__ We &apos;d better take them seriously .
__bs__ If you see a snake , don &apos;t pick it up .
__bs__ If you see a cliff , don &apos;t jump off .
__bs__ They &apos;re designed to keep us safe , and we should take them seriously .
__bs__ That &apos;s a logical error .
__bs__ Another objection : There &apos;s nothing really new here .
__bs__ Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it &apos;s mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around .
__bs__ There &apos;s nothing new here .
__bs__ Well , not exactly .
__bs__ It &apos;s like saying , I know that that blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer , but if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely , I see little pixels , and that &apos;s the reality of the computer .
__bs__ Well , not really — you &apos;re still on the desktop , and that &apos;s the point .
__bs__ Those microscopic particles are still in space and time : they &apos;re still in the user interface .
__bs__ So I &apos;m saying something far more radical than those physicists .
__bs__ Finally , you might object , look , we all see the train , therefore none of us constructs the train .
__bs__ But remember this example .
__bs__ In this example , we all see a cube , but the screen is flat , so the cube that you see is the cube that you construct .
__bs__ We all see a cube because we all , each one of us , constructs the cube that we see .
__bs__ The same is true of the train .
__bs__ We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct , and the same is true of all physical objects .
__bs__ We &apos;re inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is .
__bs__ The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions .
__bs__ Instead , reality is more like a 3D desktop that &apos;s designed to hide the complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior .
__bs__ Space as you perceive it is your desktop .
__bs__ Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop .
__bs__ We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way .
__bs__ Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way .
__bs__ We were wrong .
__bs__ We had misinterpreted our perceptions .
__bs__ Now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is .
__bs__ The theory of evolution is telling us that once again , we &apos;re wrong .
__bs__ We &apos;re misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences .
__bs__ There &apos;s something that exists when you don &apos;t look , but it &apos;s not spacetime and physical objects .
__bs__ It &apos;s as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle .
__bs__ Why ? Because we &apos;re blind to our own blindnesses .
__bs__ But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle : our science and technology .
__bs__ By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality , and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality .
__bs__ When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato , I am interacting with reality , but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato .
__bs__ Similarly , when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak , I &apos;m interacting with reality , but that reality is not a lion or a steak .
__bs__ And here &apos;s the kicker : When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain , or neurons , I am interacting with reality , but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons .
__bs__ Brains and neurons have no causal powers .
__bs__ Brains and neurons are a species-specific set of symbols , a hack .
__bs__ What does this mean for the mystery of consciousness ?
__bs__ Well , it opens up new possibilities .
__bs__ For instance , perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences .
__bs__ I doubt this , but it &apos;s worth exploring .
__bs__ Perhaps reality is some vast , interacting network of conscious agents , simple and complex , that cause each other &apos;s conscious experiences .
__bs__ Actually , this isn &apos;t as crazy an idea as it seems , and I &apos;m currently exploring it .
__bs__ But here &apos;s the point : Once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false assumption about the nature of reality , it opens up new ways to think about life &apos;s greatest mystery .
__bs__ I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we &apos;ve ever imagined .
__bs__ The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare : Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth , it &apos;s about having kids .
__bs__ And by the way , even this TED is just in your head .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : If that &apos;s really you there , thank you .
__bs__ So there &apos;s so much from this .
__bs__ I mean , first of all , some people may just be profoundly depressed at the thought that , if evolution does not favor reality , I mean , doesn &apos;t that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here , all our ability to think that we can think the truth , possibly even including your own theory , if you go there ?
__bs__ Donald Hoffman : Well , this does not stop us from a successful science .
__bs__ What we have is one theory that turned out to be false , that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions .
__bs__ That theory turns out to be false .
__bs__ Okay , throw that theory away .
__bs__ That doesn &apos;t stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality , so it &apos;s actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false .
__bs__ So science continues as normal . There &apos;s no problem here .
__bs__ CA : So you think it &apos;s possible — ( Laughter ) — This is cool , but what you &apos;re saying I think is it &apos;s possible that evolution can still get you to reason .
__bs__ DH : Yes . Now that &apos;s a very , very good point .
__bs__ The evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception , and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is , but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics .
__bs__ We haven &apos;t done these simulations , but my bet is that we &apos;ll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth .
__bs__ I mean , if you &apos;re like me , math and logic is not easy .
__bs__ DH : Well , it &apos;s slightly different than Berkeley .
__bs__ Berkeley thought that , he was a deist , and he thought that the ultimate nature of reality is God and so forth , and I don &apos;t need to go where Berkeley &apos;s going , so it &apos;s quite a bit different from Berkeley .
__bs__ I call this conscious realism . It &apos;s actually a very different approach .
__bs__ CA : Don , I could literally talk with you for hours , and I hope to do that .
__bs__ Thanks so much for that . DH : Thank you . ( Applause )
__bs__ I have a confession to make .
__bs__ I am addicted to adventure , and as a young boy , I would rather look outside the window at the birds in the trees and the sky than looking at that two-dimensional chalky blackboard where time stands still and even sometimes dies .
__bs__ My teachers thought there was something wrong with me because I wasn &apos;t paying attention in class .
__bs__ They didn &apos;t find anything specifically wrong with me , other than being slightly dyslexic because I &apos;m a lefty .
__bs__ Curiosity , to me , is about our connection with the world , with the universe .
__bs__ Now , my dream of dreams , I want to go explore the oceans of Mars , but until we can go there , I think the oceans still hold quite a few secrets .
__bs__ As a matter of fact , if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is and dissect it into a living space , the ocean represents over 3.4 billion cubic kilometers of volume , within which we &apos;ve explored less than five percent .
__bs__ And I look at this , and I go , well , there are tools to go deeper , longer and further : submarines , ROVs , even Scuba diving .
__bs__ But if we &apos;re going to explore the final frontier on this planet , we need to live there .
__bs__ We need to build a log cabin , if you will , at the bottom of the sea .
__bs__ And so there was a great curiosity in my soul when I went to go visit a TED &#91; Prize winner &#93; by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle .
__bs__ Maybe you &apos;ve heard of her .
__bs__ Two years ago , she was staked out at the last undersea marine laboratory to try and save it , to try and petition for us not to scrap it and bring it back on land .
__bs__ We &apos;ve only had about a dozen or so scientific labs at the bottom of the sea .
__bs__ There &apos;s only one left in the world : it &apos;s nine miles offshore and 65 feet down .
__bs__ It &apos;s called Aquarius .
__bs__ Aquarius , in some fashion , is a dinosaur , an ancient robot chained to the bottom , this Leviathan .
__bs__ In other ways , it &apos;s a legacy .
__bs__ And so with that visit , I realized that my time is short if I wanted to experience what it was like to become an aquanaut .
__bs__ When we swam towards this after many moons of torture and two years of preparation , this habitat waiting to invite us was like a new home .
__bs__ And the point of going down to and living at this habitat was not to stay inside .
__bs__ It wasn &apos;t about living at something the size of a school bus .
__bs__ It was about giving us the luxury of time outside to wander , to explore , to understand more about this oceanic final frontier .
__bs__ We had megafauna come and visit us .
__bs__ This spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans .
__bs__ But why this is so important , why this picture is up , is because this particular animal brought his friends around , and instead of being the pelagic animals that they were , they started getting curious about us , these new strangers that were moving into the neighborhood , doing things with plankton .
__bs__ This particular animal actually circled for 31 full days during our mission .
__bs__ So mission 31 wasn &apos;t so much about breaking records .
__bs__ It was about that human-ocean connection .
__bs__ Because of the luxury of time , we were able to study animals such as sharks and grouper in aggregations that we &apos;ve never seen before .
__bs__ It &apos;s like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together .
__bs__ Even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us , such as this endangered goliath grouper who only still resides in the Florida Keys .
__bs__ Of course , just like any neighbor , after a while , if they get tired , the goliath grouper barks at us , and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second .
__bs__ For us , it &apos;s just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone .
__bs__ Now , this wasn &apos;t just about adventure .
__bs__ There was actually a serious note to it .
__bs__ We did a lot of science , and again , because of the luxury of time , we were able to do over three years of science in 31 days .
__bs__ In this particular case , we were using a PAM , or , let me just see if I can get this straight , a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer .
__bs__ And our scientists from FIU , MIT , and from Northeastern were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do when we &apos;re not around .
__bs__ The Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer , or PAM , gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change-related issues .
__bs__ We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools , such as this sonde , or what I like to call the sponge proctologist , whereby the sonde itself tests for metabolism rates in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge , or the redwoods of the &#91; ocean &#93; .
__bs__ And finally , we looked at predator-prey behavior .
__bs__ And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing , because as we take away some of the predators on these coral reefs around the world , the prey , or the forage fish , act very differently .
__bs__ What we realized is not only do they stop taking care of the reef , darting in , grabbing a little bit of algae and going back into their homes , they start spreading out and disappearing from those particular coral reefs .
__bs__ Well , within that 31 days , we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers on each one of these topics .
__bs__ But the point of adventure is not only to learn , it &apos;s to be able to share that knowledge with the world , and with that , thanks to a couple of engineers at MIT , we were able to use a prototype camera called the Edgertronic to capture slow-motion video , up to 20,000 frames per second in a little box that &apos;s worth 3,000 dollars .
__bs__ It &apos;s available to every one of us .
__bs__ And that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can &apos;t even see it in the blink of an eye .
__bs__ Let me show you a quick video of what this camera does .
__bs__ You can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats .
__bs__ It gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for 31 days and never normally would have paid attention to , such as hermit crabs .
__bs__ Now , using a cutting-edge piece of technology that &apos;s not really meant for the oceans is not always easy .
__bs__ We sometimes had to put the camera upside down , cordon it back to the lab , and actually man the trigger from the lab itself .
__bs__ That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet , and if you ever try to catch a bullet in mid-flight with your eye , impossible .
__bs__ But now we can see things such as these Christmas tree worms pulling in and fanning out in a way that the eye just can &apos;t capture , or in this case , a fish throwing up grains of sand .
__bs__ This is an actual sailfin goby , and if you look at it in real time , it actually doesn &apos;t even show its fanning motion because it &apos;s so quick .
__bs__ One of the most precious gifts that we had underwater is that we had WiFi , and for 31 days straight we were able to connect with the world in real time from the bottom of the sea and share all of these experiences .
__bs__ Quite literally right there I am Skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the 70,000 students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences .
__bs__ As a matter of fact , I &apos;m showing a picture that I took with my smartphone from underwater of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom .
__bs__ We had never seen that before .
__bs__ And I dream of the day that we have underwater cities , and maybe , just maybe , if we push the boundaries of adventure and knowledge , and we share that knowledge with others out there , we can solve all sorts of problems .
__bs__ My grandfather used to say , &quot; People protect what they love . &quot;
__bs__ My father , &quot; &quot; How can people protect what they don &apos;t understand ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve thought about this my whole life .
__bs__ Nothing is impossible .
__bs__ We need to dream , we need to be creative , and we all need to have an adventure in order to create miracles in the darkest of times .
__bs__ And who knows , maybe there will be underwater cities , and maybe some of you will become the future aquanauts .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ One of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don &apos;t — into the religious and the atheists .
__bs__ And for the last decade or so , it &apos;s been quite clear what being an atheist means .
__bs__ There have been some very vocal atheists who &apos;ve pointed out , not just that religion is wrong , but that it &apos;s ridiculous .
__bs__ These people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued — they &apos;ve argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game .
__bs__ Now I think it &apos;s too easy . I think it &apos;s too easy
__bs__ to dismiss the whole of religion that way .
__bs__ And it &apos;s as easy as shooting fish in a barrel .
__bs__ And what I &apos;d like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist — if you like , a new version of atheism we could call Atheism 2.0 .
__bs__ Now what is Atheism 2.0 ?
__bs__ Well it starts from a very basic premise : of course , there &apos;s no God .
__bs__ Of course , there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels , etc .
__bs__ Now let &apos;s move on ; that &apos;s not the end of the story , that &apos;s the very , very beginning .
__bs__ I &apos;m interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t believe in any of this stuff .
__bs__ I can &apos;t believe in the doctrines .
__bs__ I don &apos;t think these doctrines are right .
__bs__ But , &quot; &quot; a very important but , &quot; &quot; I love Christmas carols .
__bs__ I really like the art of Mantegna .
__bs__ I really like looking at old churches .
__bs__ I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament . &quot; &quot; Whatever it may be , you know the kind of thing I &apos;m talking about — people who are attracted to the ritualistic side , the moralistic , communal side of religion , but can &apos;t bear the doctrine .
__bs__ Until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
__bs__ It &apos;s almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you &apos;re living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart .
__bs__ So that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
__bs__ I don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
__bs__ I think there is an alternative .
__bs__ I think there are ways — and I &apos;m being both very respectful and completely impious — of stealing from religions .
__bs__ If you don &apos;t believe in a religion , there &apos;s nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
__bs__ And for me , atheism 2.0 is about both , as I say , a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying , &quot; &quot; What here could we use ? &quot; &quot; The secular world is full of holes .
__bs__ We have secularized badly , I would argue .
__bs__ And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well .
__bs__ And I &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
__bs__ I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
__bs__ Now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
__bs__ When we think about how we &apos;re going to make the world a better place , we think education ; that &apos;s where we put a lot of money .
__bs__ Education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it &apos;s also going to make us better people .
__bs__ You know the kind of thing a commencement address is , and graduation ceremonies , those lyrical claims that education , the process of education — particularly higher education — will make us into nobler and better human beings .
__bs__ That &apos;s a lovely idea .
__bs__ Interesting where it came from .
__bs__ In the early 19th century , church attendance in Western Europe started sliding down very , very sharply , and people panicked .
__bs__ They asked themselves the following question .
__bs__ They said , where are people going to find the morality , where are they going to find guidance , and where are they going to find sources of consolation ?
__bs__ And influential voices came up with one answer .
__bs__ They said culture .
__bs__ It &apos;s to culture that we should look for guidance , for consolation , for morality .
__bs__ Let &apos;s look to the plays of Shakespeare , the dialogues of Plato , the novels of Jane Austen .
__bs__ In there , we &apos;ll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John .
__bs__ Now I think that &apos;s a very beautiful idea and a very true idea .
__bs__ They wanted to replace scripture with culture .
__bs__ And that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
__bs__ It &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
__bs__ If you went to a top university — let &apos;s say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge — and you said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve come here because I &apos;m in search of morality , guidance and consolation ; I want to know how to live , &quot; &quot; they would show you the way to the insane asylum .
__bs__ This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .
__bs__ Why ? They don &apos;t think we need it .
__bs__ They don &apos;t think we are in an urgent need of assistance .
__bs__ They see us as adults , rational adults .
__bs__ What we need is information .
__bs__ We need data , we don &apos;t need help .
__bs__ Now religions start from a very different place indeed .
__bs__ All religions , all major religions , at various points call us children .
__bs__ And like children , they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .
__bs__ We &apos;re only just holding it together .
__bs__ Perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
__bs__ But anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
__bs__ And we need help . Of course , we need help .
__bs__ And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .
__bs__ You know , in the 18th century in the U.K. , the greatest preacher , greatest religious preacher , was a man called John Wesley , who went up and down this country delivering sermons , advising people how they could live .
__bs__ He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents , the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich .
__bs__ He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
__bs__ Now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of sermons .
__bs__ If you said to a modern liberal individualist , &quot; Hey , how about a sermon ? &quot;
__bs__ they &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; No , no . I don &apos;t need one of those .
__bs__ I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the difference between a sermon and our modern , secular mode of delivery , the lecture ?
__bs__ Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
__bs__ And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
__bs__ The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , morality and consolation — and religions know that .
__bs__ Another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once , they &apos;ll remember it .
__bs__ Sit them in a classroom , tell them about Plato at the age of 20 , send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years , and that lesson will stick with them .
__bs__ Religions go , &quot; &quot; Nonsense .
__bs__ You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
__bs__ So get on your knees and repeat it . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what all religions tell us : &quot; Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
__bs__ Otherwise our minds are like sieves .
__bs__ So religions are cultures of repetition .
__bs__ They circle the great truths again and again and again .
__bs__ We associate repetition with boredom .
__bs__ &quot; &quot; Give us the new , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
__bs__ &quot; The new is better than the old . &quot;
__bs__ If I said to you , &quot; &quot; Okay , we &apos;re not going to have new TED .
__bs__ We &apos;re just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they &apos;re so true .
__bs__ We &apos;re going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times because what she says is so clever , &quot; &quot; you &apos;d feel cheated .
__bs__ Not so if you &apos;re adopting a religious mindset .
__bs__ The other things that religions do is to arrange time .
__bs__ All the major religions give us calendars .
__bs__ What is a calendar ?
__bs__ A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas .
__bs__ In the Catholic chronology , Catholic calendar , at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor .
__bs__ You won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
__bs__ Now we don &apos;t think that way .
__bs__ In the secular world we think , &quot; &quot; If an idea is important , I &apos;ll bump into it .
__bs__ I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot; &quot; Nonsense , says the religious world view .
__bs__ Religious view says we need calendars , we need to structure time , we need to synchronize encounters .
__bs__ This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
__bs__ Take the Moon . It &apos;s really important to look at the Moon .
__bs__ You know , when you look at the Moon , you think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really small . What are my problems ? &quot; &quot; It sets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
__bs__ We should all look at the Moon a bit more often . We don &apos;t .
__bs__ Why don &apos;t we ? Well there &apos;s nothing to tell us , &quot; &quot; Look at the Moon . &quot; &quot; But if you &apos;re a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi , where you will be given poems to read in honor of the Moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of .
__bs__ You &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
__bs__ And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
__bs__ That &apos;s very good .
__bs__ The other thing that religions are really aware of is : speak well — I &apos;m not doing a very good job of this here — but oratory , oratory is absolutely key to religions .
__bs__ In the secular world , you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .
__bs__ But the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
__bs__ What you &apos;re saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .
__bs__ So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
__bs__ After every convincing point , people will go , &quot; &quot; Amen , amen , amen . &quot; &quot; At the end of a really rousing paragraph , they &apos;ll all stand up , and they &apos;ll go , &quot; &quot; Thank you Jesus , thank you Christ , thank you Savior . &quot; &quot; If we were doing it like they do it — let &apos;s not do it , but if we were to do it — I would tell you something like , &quot; &quot; Culture should replace scripture . &quot; &quot; And you would go , &quot; &quot; Amen , amen , amen . &quot; &quot; And at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; &quot; Thank you Plato , thank you Shakespeare , thank you Jane Austen . &quot; &quot; And we &apos;d know that we had a real rhythm going .
__bs__ All right , all right . We &apos;re getting there . We &apos;re getting there .
__bs__ ( Applause ) The other thing that religions know is we &apos;re not just brains , we are also bodies .
__bs__ And when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
__bs__ So for example , take the Jewish idea of forgiveness .
__bs__ Jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh .
__bs__ They don &apos;t just deliver us sermons on this .
__bs__ They don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
__bs__ They tell us to have a bath .
__bs__ So in Orthodox Jewish communities , every Friday you go to a Mikveh .
__bs__ You immerse yourself in the water , and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea .
__bs__ We don &apos;t tend to do that .
__bs__ Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
__bs__ Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
__bs__ Let &apos;s look at art now .
__bs__ Now art is something that in the secular world , we think very highly of . We think art is really , really important .
__bs__ A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums , etc .
__bs__ We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals , or our new churches .
__bs__ You &apos;ve heard that saying .
__bs__ Now I think that the potential is there , but we &apos;ve completely let ourselves down .
__bs__ And the reason we &apos;ve let ourselves down is that we &apos;re not properly studying how religions handle art .
__bs__ The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art : The first idea is that art should be for art &apos;s sake — a ridiculous idea — an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world .
__bs__ I couldn &apos;t disagree more .
__bs__ The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
__bs__ That &apos;s why a very common feeling when you &apos;re in a museum — let &apos;s admit it — is , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what this is about . &quot; &quot; But if we &apos;re serious people , we don &apos;t admit to that .
__bs__ But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
__bs__ Now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
__bs__ They have no trouble telling us what art is about .
__bs__ Art is about two things in all the major faiths .
__bs__ Firstly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to love .
__bs__ And secondly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
__bs__ And that &apos;s what art is .
__bs__ Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
__bs__ So as you walk around a church , or a mosque or a cathedral , what you &apos;re trying to imbibe , what you &apos;re imbibing is , through your eyes , through your senses , truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
__bs__ Essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
__bs__ Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view .
__bs__ Now the word &quot; &quot; propaganda &quot; &quot; sets off alarm bells .
__bs__ We think of Hitler , we think of Stalin . Don &apos;t , necessarily .
__bs__ Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something .
__bs__ And if that thing is good , there &apos;s no problem with it at all .
__bs__ My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
__bs__ And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum — if I was a museum curator , I would make a room for love , a room for generosity .
__bs__ All works of art are talking to us about things .
__bs__ And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
__bs__ Art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we &apos;ve neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas .
__bs__ Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
__bs__ Art should be didactic .
__bs__ Let &apos;s think of something else .
__bs__ The people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
__bs__ They &apos;re poets , they &apos;re philosophers , they &apos;re photographers , they &apos;re filmmakers .
__bs__ And they tend to be on their own .
__bs__ They &apos;re our cottage industries . They are vulnerable , single people .
__bs__ And they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
__bs__ And they don &apos;t really change much .
__bs__ Now think about religions , think about organized religions .
__bs__ What do organized religions do ?
__bs__ They group together , they form institutions .
__bs__ And that has all sorts of advantages .
__bs__ First of all , scale , might .
__bs__ The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the Wall Street Journal .
__bs__ These are massive machines .
__bs__ They &apos;re collaborative , they &apos;re branded , they &apos;re multinational , and they &apos;re highly disciplined .
__bs__ These are all very good qualities .
__bs__ We recognize them in relation to corporations .
__bs__ And corporations are very like religions in many ways , except they &apos;re right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs .
__bs__ They &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
__bs__ Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff — the therapists , the poets — are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
__bs__ So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
__bs__ Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
__bs__ Books alone , books written by lone individuals , are not going to change anything .
__bs__ We need to group together .
__bs__ If you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
__bs__ And that &apos;s what religions do .
__bs__ They are multinational , as I say , they are branded , they have a clear identity , so they don &apos;t get lost in a busy world .
__bs__ That &apos;s something we can learn from .
__bs__ I want to conclude .
__bs__ Really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields , there is something to learn from the example of religion — even if you don &apos;t believe any of it .
__bs__ If you &apos;re involved in anything that &apos;s communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
__bs__ If you &apos;re involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
__bs__ Look very closely at pilgrimage .
__bs__ We haven &apos;t begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven &apos;t looked at what religions do with travel .
__bs__ If you &apos;re in the art world , look at the example of what religions are doing with art .
__bs__ And if you &apos;re an educator in any way , again , look at how religions are spreading ideas .
__bs__ You may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they &apos;re highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
__bs__ So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion , but at the end of the day , religions are so subtle , so complicated , so intelligent in many ways that they &apos;re not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone ; they &apos;re for all of us .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Now this is actually a courageous talk , because you &apos;re kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .
__bs__ AB : You can get shot by both sides .
__bs__ You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
__bs__ CA : Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment .
__bs__ AB : Indeed .
__bs__ CA : But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense — that &apos;s actually probably the most important thing to anyone who &apos;s religious — of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that &apos;s bigger than you are .
__bs__ Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0 ?
__bs__ AB : Absolutely . I , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; &quot; But isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Of course . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; So aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot; &quot; And I go , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Why does that sense of mystery , that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe , need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling ?
__bs__ Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it , so I don &apos;t feel the need .
__bs__ The universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious superstructure .
__bs__ So one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit .
__bs__ CA : Actually , let me just ask a question .
__bs__ How many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
__bs__ Is there an equivalent process by which there &apos;s a sort of bridge between what you &apos;re talking about and what you would say to them ?
__bs__ AB : I would say that there are many , many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .
__bs__ It &apos;s not as though , as I try to suggest , it &apos;s not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you don &apos;t have religion and then you &apos;re cut off from all these very good things .
__bs__ It &apos;s so sad that we constantly say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe so I can &apos;t have community , so I &apos;m cut off from morality , so I can &apos;t go on a pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; One wants to say , &quot; &quot; Nonsense . Why not ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
__bs__ There &apos;s so much we can absorb .
__bs__ Atheism shouldn &apos;t cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
__bs__ CA : It seems to me that there &apos;s plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists .
__bs__ But probably most people in the community certainly don &apos;t think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
__bs__ Are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war , that there could be bridging ?
__bs__ AB : No , we need to be polite about differences .
__bs__ Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
__bs__ It &apos;s seen as hypocrisy .
__bs__ But we need to get to a stage when you &apos;re an atheist and someone says , &quot; &quot; Well you know , I did pray the other day , &quot; &quot; you politely ignore it .
__bs__ You move on .
__bs__ Because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
__bs__ And I think that &apos;s what the religious wars of late have ignored .
__bs__ They &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
__bs__ CA : And finally , does this new thing that you &apos;re proposing that &apos;s not a religion but something else , does it need a leader , and are you volunteering to be the pope ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) AB : Well , one thing that we &apos;re all very suspicious of is individual leaders .
__bs__ It doesn &apos;t need it .
__bs__ What I &apos;ve tried to lay out is a framework and I &apos;m hoping that people can just fill it in .
__bs__ I &apos;ve sketched a sort of broad framework .
__bs__ But wherever you are , as I say , if you &apos;re in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
__bs__ If you &apos;re in the communal industry , look at religion and do the communal bit .
__bs__ So it &apos;s a wiki project .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) CA : Alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m going to talk about your mindset .
__bs__ Does your mindset correspond to my dataset ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) If not , one or the other needs upgrading , isn &apos;t it ?
__bs__ When I talk to my students about global issues , and I listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them , &quot; &quot; What do you mean with &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; them &quot; &quot; ?
__bs__ &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s very easy . It &apos;s the western world and it &apos;s the developing world , &quot; &quot; they say .
__bs__ &quot; We learned it in college . &quot;
__bs__ And what is the definition then ? &quot; &quot; The definition ?
__bs__ Everyone knows , &quot; &quot; they say .
__bs__ But then you know , I press them like this .
__bs__ So one girl said , very cleverly , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s very easy .
__bs__ Western world is a long life in a small family .
__bs__ Developing world is a short life in a large family . &quot; &quot; And I like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset .
__bs__ And here you have the dataset .
__bs__ So , you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family . One , two , three , four , five children per woman on this axis .
__bs__ And here , length of life , life expectancy , 30 , 40 , 50 .
__bs__ Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world .
__bs__ And really this is about the bedroom .
__bs__ Whether the man and woman decide to have small family , and take care of their kids , and how long they will live .
__bs__ It &apos;s about the bathroom and the kitchen . If you have soap , water and food , you know , you can live long .
__bs__ And the students were right . It wasn &apos;t that the world consisted — the world consisted here , of one set of countries over here , which had large families and short life . Developing world .
__bs__ And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .
__bs__ They had small families and long life .
__bs__ And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime .
__bs__ Then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
__bs__ And all the developing world started to apply family planning .
__bs__ And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment .
__bs__ And you see all the world moves over to a two child family , and a life with 60 to 70 years .
__bs__ But some countries remain back in this area here .
__bs__ And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here .
__bs__ We have Liberia . We have Congo .
__bs__ So we have countries living there .
__bs__ So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we , in fact , when we have played this over the world .
__bs__ I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week , and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had , that they didn &apos;t realize the improvement of Mexico there , and China , in relation to United States .
__bs__ Look here when I move them forward .
__bs__ Here we go .
__bs__ They catch up . There &apos;s Mexico .
__bs__ It &apos;s on par with United States in these two social dimensions .
__bs__ There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this .
__bs__ This great nation , Mexico , has the problem that arms are coming from North , across the borders , so they had to stop that , because they have this strange relationship to the United States , you know .
__bs__ But if I would change this axis here , I would instead put income per person .
__bs__ Income per person . I can put that here .
__bs__ And we will then see a completely different picture .
__bs__ By the way , I &apos;m teaching you how to use our website , Gapminder World , while I &apos;m correcting this , because this is a free utility on the net .
__bs__ And when I now finally got it right , I can go back 200 years in history .
__bs__ And I can find United States up there .
__bs__ And I can let the other countries be shown .
__bs__ And now I have income per person on this axis .
__bs__ And United States only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time .
__bs__ And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years , on par with Afghanistan today .
__bs__ And what has happened in the world , I will show now .
__bs__ This is instead of studying history for one year at university .
__bs__ You can watch me for one minute now and you &apos;ll see the whole thing .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) You can see how the brown bubbles , which is west Europe , and the yellow one , which is the United States , they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier .
__bs__ And this is now 100 years ago , where the rest of the world remains behind .
__bs__ Here we come . And that was the influenza .
__bs__ That &apos;s why we are so scared about flu , isn &apos;t it ?
__bs__ It &apos;s still remembered . The fall of life expectancy .
__bs__ And then we come up . Not until independence started .
__bs__ Look here You have China over there , you have India over there , and this is what has happened .
__bs__ Did you note there , that we have Mexico up there ?
__bs__ Mexico is not at all on par with the United States , but they are quite close .
__bs__ And especially , it &apos;s interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years , because I have my oldest son now working for Google , after Google acquired this software .
__bs__ Because in fact , this is child labor . My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this .
__bs__ And my youngest son , who studied Chinese in Beijing .
__bs__ So they come in with the two perspectives I have , you know ?
__bs__ And my son , youngest son who studied in Beijing , in China , he got a long-term perspective .
__bs__ Whereas when my oldest son , who works for Google , he should develop by quarter , or by half-year .
__bs__ Or Google is quite generous , so he can have one or two years to go .
__bs__ But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period , for 100 years , when they went backwards .
__bs__ And then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward .
__bs__ But this was 1963 .
__bs__ Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China , and then he died , and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward .
__bs__ Isn &apos;t it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy , and then gradually got rich ?
__bs__ Whereas China could get healthy much earlier , because they applied the knowledge of education , nutrition , and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning .
__bs__ And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
__bs__ So to me , as a public health professor , it &apos;s not strange that all these countries grow so fast now .
__bs__ Because what you see here , what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman , isn &apos;t it .
__bs__ It &apos;s not really , really flat .
__bs__ But the middle income countries — and this is where I suggest to my students , stop using the concept &quot; &quot; developing world . &quot; &quot; Because after all , talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States .
__bs__ The last chapter is about present , and president Obama , and the other is about the past , where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower .
__bs__ Because Washington to Eisenhower , that is what we find in the developing world .
__bs__ We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower , and that would be put together into a developing world , which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way , which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collapsing countries .
__bs__ So , how could we make better sense about this ?
__bs__ Well , one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution .
__bs__ This is the income distribution of peoples in the world , from $ 1 . This is where you have food to eat .
__bs__ These people go to bed hungry .
__bs__ And this is the number of people .
__bs__ This is $ 10 , whether you have a public or a private health service system . This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children , and this is OECD countries : Green , Latin America , East Europe .
__bs__ This is East Asia , and the light blue there is South Asia .
__bs__ And this is how the world changed .
__bs__ It changed like this .
__bs__ Can you see how it &apos;s growing ? And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia ?
__bs__ And it goes over here ?
__bs__ And I come now , into projections , but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there , you know , because — ( Laughter ) that &apos;s where the projections are not valid any longer .
__bs__ Probably the world will do this .
__bs__ and then it will continue forward like this .
__bs__ But more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided .
__bs__ We have the high income countries here , with the United States as a leading power ; we have the emerging economies in the middle , which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ; and we have the low income countries here .
__bs__ Yeah , this is a fact that from where the money comes , they have been saving , you know , over the last decade .
__bs__ And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are .
__bs__ And here we have the countries in collapse and war , like Afghanistan , Somalia , parts of Congo , Darfur .
__bs__ We have all this at the same time .
__bs__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world .
__bs__ Because it &apos;s so different , what has happened there .
__bs__ And that &apos;s why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it .
__bs__ And you have huge differences within countries also .
__bs__ I heard that your departments here were by regions .
__bs__ Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa , South Asia , East Asia , Arab states , East Europe , Latin America , and OECD .
__bs__ And on this axis , GDP .
__bs__ And on this , heath , child survival , and it doesn &apos;t come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom .
__bs__ But when I split it , when I split it into country bubbles , the size of the bubbles here is the population .
__bs__ Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius , completely different .
__bs__ There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa .
__bs__ And I can split the others . Here is the South Asian , Arab world .
__bs__ Now all your different departments .
__bs__ East Europe , Latin America , and OECD countries .
__bs__ And here were are . We have a continuum in the world .
__bs__ We cannot put it into two parts .
__bs__ It is Mayflower down here . It is Washington here , building , building countries .
__bs__ It &apos;s Lincoln here , advancing them .
__bs__ It &apos;s Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries .
__bs__ And then it &apos;s United States today , up here .
__bs__ And we have countries all this way .
__bs__ Now , this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed .
__bs__ At this point I decided to make a pause .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And it is my task , on behalf of the rest of the world , to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers , for Demographic Health Survey .
__bs__ Many are not aware of — no , this is not a joke .
__bs__ This is very serious .
__bs__ It is due to USA &apos;s continuous sponsoring during 25 years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what &apos;s happening in the world .
__bs__ ( Applause ) And it is U.S. government at its best , without advocacy , providing facts , that it &apos;s useful for the society .
__bs__ And providing data free of charge on the internet , for the world to use . Thank you very much .
__bs__ Quite the opposite of the World Bank , who compiled data with government money , tax money , and then they sell it to add a little profit , in a very inefficient , Gutenberg way .
__bs__ ( Applause ) But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world .
__bs__ And they are highly skilled professionals .
__bs__ It &apos;s just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way , as we do .
__bs__ And when it comes to free data and transparency , United States of America is one of the best .
__bs__ And that doesn &apos;t come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m not paid to come here , no .
__bs__ I would like to show you what happens with the data , what we can show with this data .
__bs__ Look here . This is the world .
__bs__ With income down there and child mortality .
__bs__ And what has happened in the world ?
__bs__ Since 1950 , during the last 50 years we have had a fall in child mortality .
__bs__ And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this .
__bs__ And we had an increase in income .
__bs__ And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world .
__bs__ We have a continuum . But we still have , of course , Congo , up there . We still have as poor countries as we have had , always , in history .
__bs__ And that &apos;s the bottom billion , where we &apos;ve heard today about a completely new approach to do it .
__bs__ And how fast has this happened ?
__bs__ Well , MDG 4 .
__bs__ The United States has not been so eager to use MDG 4 .
__bs__ But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it , because it &apos;s the only child mortality that we can measure .
__bs__ And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year .
__bs__ Let &apos;s see what Sweden has done .
__bs__ We used to boast about fast social progress .
__bs__ That &apos;s where we were , 1900 .
__bs__ 1900 , Sweden was there .
__bs__ Same child mortality as Bangladesh had , 1990 , though they had lower income .
__bs__ They started very well . They used the aid well .
__bs__ They vaccinated the kids . They get better water .
__bs__ And they reduced child mortality , with an amazing 4.7 percent per year . They beat Sweden .
__bs__ I run Sweden the same 16 year period .
__bs__ Second round , it &apos;s Sweden , 1916 , against Egypt , 1990 .
__bs__ Here we go . Once again the USA is part of the reason here .
__bs__ They get safe water , they get food for the poor , and they get malaria eradicated .
__bs__ 5.5 percent . They are faster than the millennium development goal .
__bs__ And third chance for Sweden , against Brazil here .
__bs__ Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last 16 years , and they go faster than Sweden .
__bs__ This means that the world is converging .
__bs__ The middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catching up .
__bs__ They are moving to cities , where they also get better assistance for that .
__bs__ Well the Swedish students protest at this point .
__bs__ They say , &quot; &quot; This is not fair , because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden .
__bs__ We have to do real-time competition . &quot; &quot; Okay . I give you Singapore , the year I was born .
__bs__ Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden .
__bs__ It &apos;s the most tropical country in the world , a marshland on the equator .
__bs__ And here we go . It took a little time for them to get independent .
__bs__ But then they started to grow their economy .
__bs__ And they made the social investment . They got away malaria .
__bs__ They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S. and Sweden .
__bs__ We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden !
__bs__ ( Applause ) All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals .
__bs__ These yellow are just about to be doing this .
__bs__ These red are the countries that doesn &apos;t do it , and the policy has to be improved .
__bs__ Not simplistic extrapolation .
__bs__ We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way .
__bs__ We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing .
__bs__ And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world .
__bs__ This is dollar per person . This is HIV in the countries .
__bs__ The blue is Africa .
__bs__ The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected .
__bs__ You see the tragedy in South Africa there .
__bs__ About 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
__bs__ And in spite of them having quite a high income , they have a huge number of HIV infected .
__bs__ But you also see that there are African countries down here .
__bs__ There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa .
__bs__ There &apos;s a number , five to 10 countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States .
__bs__ And there are others who are extremely high .
__bs__ And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries , with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance , Botswana .
__bs__ They have a very high level . It &apos;s coming down .
__bs__ But now it &apos;s not falling , because there , with help from PEPFAR , it &apos;s working with treatment . And people are not dying .
__bs__ And you can see it &apos;s not that easy , that it is war which caused this .
__bs__ Because here , in Congo , there is war .
__bs__ And here , in Zambia , there is peace .
__bs__ And it &apos;s not the economy . Richer country has a little higher .
__bs__ If I split Tanzania in its income , the richer 20 percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one .
__bs__ And it &apos;s really different within each country .
__bs__ Look at the provinces of Kenya . They are very different .
__bs__ And this is the situation you see .
__bs__ It &apos;s not deep poverty . It &apos;s the special situation , probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries , or some parts of countries , in south and eastern Africa .
__bs__ Don &apos;t make it Africa . Don &apos;t make it a race issue .
__bs__ Make it a local issue . And do prevention at each place , in the way it can be done there .
__bs__ So to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
__bs__ Those who live beyond the cellphone , those who have yet to see a computer , those who have no electricity at home .
__bs__ This is the disease , Konzo , I spent 20 years elucidating in Africa .
__bs__ It &apos;s caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation .
__bs__ It &apos;s similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the &apos; 30s .
__bs__ It &apos;s similar to other nutritional diseases .
__bs__ It will never affect a rich person .
__bs__ We have seen it here in Mozambique .
__bs__ This is the epidemic in Mozambique . This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania .
__bs__ You never heard about the disease .
__bs__ But it &apos;s much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease .
__bs__ Cause crippling throughout the world .
__bs__ And over the last two years , 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region .
__bs__ That used to be the illegal diamond trade , from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola .
__bs__ That has now disappeared , and they are now in great economic problem .
__bs__ And one week ago , for the first time , there were four lines on the Internet .
__bs__ Don &apos;t get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries .
__bs__ There is still mystery in one billion .
__bs__ And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world .
__bs__ We need a new mindset . The world is converging , but — but — but not the bottom billion .
__bs__ They are still as poor as they &apos;ve ever been .
__bs__ It &apos;s not sustainable , and it will not happen around one superpower .
__bs__ But you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be .
__bs__ And this institution will have a very crucial role , not for United States , but for the world .
__bs__ So you have a very bad name , State Department . This is not the State Department .
__bs__ It &apos;s the World Department .
__bs__ And we have a high hope in you . Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey , actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis .
__bs__ As a child , I had two passions .
__bs__ One was a passion for rodents .
__bs__ I had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
__bs__ You name it , I bred it , and I sold them to pet shops .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) I also had a passion for Africa .
__bs__ Growing up in a multicultural environment , we had African students in the house , and I learned about their stories , so different backgrounds , dependency on imported know-how , goods , services , exuberant cultural diversity .
__bs__ Africa was truly fascinating for me .
__bs__ I became an industrial engineer , engineer in product development , and I focused on appropriate detection technologies , actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries .
__bs__ I started working in the industry , but I wasn &apos;t really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear , extracting and manufacturing mode .
__bs__ I quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines .
__bs__ We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
__bs__ Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development , which is really true .
__bs__ As long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you can &apos;t really enter into the land .
__bs__ Actually , there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they &apos;re needed to produce , which is mainly in the developing world .
__bs__ We chose rats .
__bs__ Why would you choose rats ?
__bs__ Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
__bs__ Well , actually rats are , in contrary to what most people think about them , rats are highly sociable creatures .
__bs__ And actually , our product — what you see here .
__bs__ There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
__bs__ You see an operator , a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right .
__bs__ There , the animal finds a mine .
__bs__ It scratches on the soil .
__bs__ And the animal comes back for a food reward .
__bs__ Very , very simple .
__bs__ Very sustainable in this environment .
__bs__ Here , the animal gets its food reward .
__bs__ And that &apos;s how it works .
__bs__ Very , very simple .
__bs__ Now why would you use rats ?
__bs__ Rats have been used since the &apos; 50s last century , in all kinds of experiments .
__bs__ Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .
__bs__ They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
__bs__ Moreover , they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it .
__bs__ Now how do we communicate with rats ?
__bs__ Well don &apos;t talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
__bs__ A clicker , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors .
__bs__ First of all , we associate the click sound with a food reward , which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe .
__bs__ Once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food — so click is food — we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds — five seconds , which is long for a rat .
__bs__ Once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
__bs__ It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes , up to 10 holes .
__bs__ Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
__bs__ In the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
__bs__ They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
__bs__ This consists of 400 square meters .
__bs__ There &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
__bs__ If the animal does that , it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field — just like dogs , by the way .
__bs__ Maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
__bs__ This is our team in Mozambique : one Tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows .
__bs__ And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people .
__bs__ They have a skill , which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid .
__bs__ Moreover , this small team together with , of course , you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up .
__bs__ But with this small investment in a rat capacity , we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal — two dollars per square meter , we do it at $ 1.18 , and we can still bring that price down .
__bs__ Question of scale .
__bs__ If you can bring in more rats , we can actually make the output even bigger .
__bs__ We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
__bs__ Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
__bs__ They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
__bs__ But let me bring you to a very different problem .
__bs__ And there &apos;s about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine , but worldwide last year , almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection .
__bs__ Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
__bs__ Microscopy , the standard WHO procedure , reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability .
__bs__ In Tanzania — the numbers don &apos;t lie — 45 percent of people — T.B. patients — get diagnosed with T.B. before they die .
__bs__ It means that , if you have T.B. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be detected , but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on .
__bs__ And if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in HIV-positives , it makes sense .
__bs__ You can actually cure T.B. , even in HIV-positives .
__bs__ So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
__bs__ is &quot; &quot; tering , &quot; &quot; which , etymologically , refers to the smell of tar .
__bs__ Already the old Chinese and the Greek , Hippocrates , have actually published , documented , that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients .
__bs__ So what we did is we collected some samples — just as a way of testing — from hospitals , trained rats on them and see if this works , and wonder , well , we can reach 89 percent sensitivity , 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row .
__bs__ This is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
__bs__ We &apos;re talking now explosives , tuberculosis , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
__bs__ So how does it work ?
__bs__ You have a cassette with 10 samples .
__bs__ You put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
__bs__ An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
__bs__ Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
__bs__ This is a positive sample .
__bs__ It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
__bs__ And by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
__bs__ Just as an indication , whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day , a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .
__bs__ A cage like this — ( Applause ) A cage like this — provided that you have rats , and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats — a cage like this , operating throughout the day , can process 1,680 samples .
__bs__ Can you imagine the potential offspring applications — environmental detection of pollutants in soils , customs applications , detection of illicit goods in containers and so on .
__bs__ But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
__bs__ I just want to briefly highlight , the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people , where 15,000 reported to get a test done .
__bs__ Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
__bs__ And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
__bs__ Throughout last year , we &apos;ve been — depending on which intervals you take — we &apos;ve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
__bs__ So this is really considerable .
__bs__ Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
__bs__ At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives .
__bs__ The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
__bs__ And there are simple things like , for instance , we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .
__bs__ So , to standardize this .
__bs__ Also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
__bs__ To conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
__bs__ Here is a first prototype of our camera rat , which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .
__bs__ This is in a prototype stage .
__bs__ We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
__bs__ To conclude , I would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
__bs__ It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
__bs__ So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you , whether they are environmental , technological , animal , or human .
__bs__ And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
