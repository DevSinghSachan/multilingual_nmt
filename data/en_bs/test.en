__bs__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__bs__ Now I work in the solar technology industry .
__bs__ And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
__bs__ ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
__bs__ It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
__bs__ Huh . Hang on a moment .
__bs__ It might take a moment to load .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
__bs__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__bs__ ( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
__bs__ Okay . ( Laughter )
__bs__ Solar technology is ...
__bs__ Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
__bs__ Okay . Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
__bs__ Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations headquarters .
__bs__ Thankfully , those plans were foiled by an FBI informant .
__bs__ Sadly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not .
__bs__ Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__bs__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__bs__ My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
__bs__ It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
__bs__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__bs__ A few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
__bs__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__bs__ We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range , which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI .
__bs__ That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
__bs__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__bs__ They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
__bs__ They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
__bs__ These were the men I looked up to .
__bs__ These were the men I called ammu , which means uncle .
__bs__ By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
__bs__ Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
__bs__ Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bullies .
__bs__ I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
__bs__ So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
__bs__ I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
__bs__ So what opened my eyes ?
__bs__ The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
__bs__ One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish .
__bs__ Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us .
__bs__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
__bs__ There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
__bs__ Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
__bs__ Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
__bs__ Then there was &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; On a nightly basis , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
__bs__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__bs__ Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
__bs__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__bs__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__bs__ I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
__bs__ So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
__bs__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__bs__ I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that I did not become fanaticized .
__bs__ Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
__bs__ I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
__bs__ For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father &apos;s actions .
__bs__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__bs__ I am not my father .
__bs__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__bs__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__bs__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__bs__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__bs__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__bs__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__bs__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__bs__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__bs__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__bs__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__bs__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__bs__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__bs__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__bs__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__bs__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__bs__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__bs__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__bs__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__bs__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__bs__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__bs__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__bs__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__bs__ They work in the field .
__bs__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__bs__ They have education programs .
__bs__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__bs__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__bs__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__bs__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__bs__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__bs__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__bs__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__bs__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__bs__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__bs__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__bs__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__bs__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__bs__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__bs__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__bs__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__bs__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__bs__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__bs__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__bs__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__bs__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__bs__ This can happen .
__bs__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__bs__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__bs__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__bs__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__bs__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__bs__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__bs__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__bs__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__bs__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__bs__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__bs__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__bs__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__bs__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__bs__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__bs__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__bs__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__bs__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__bs__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__bs__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__bs__ This is the transformation that took place .
__bs__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__bs__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__bs__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__bs__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__bs__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__bs__ I have so much money , it takes me forever .
__bs__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
__bs__ They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
__bs__ We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
__bs__ Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
__bs__ These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland , and as we speak , forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves , 20 years after the war .
__bs__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__bs__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__bs__ Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities , when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army .
__bs__ The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__bs__ Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
__bs__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__bs__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__bs__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__bs__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__bs__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__bs__ Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
__bs__ These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
__bs__ Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
__bs__ Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shelved , out of sight and out of mind .
__bs__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__bs__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__bs__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__bs__ And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
__bs__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__bs__ In this case , I am merely a tool , a forensic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
__bs__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__bs__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__bs__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__bs__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__bs__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__bs__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__bs__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__bs__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__bs__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__bs__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__bs__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__bs__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__bs__ You see that glass of water ?
__bs__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__bs__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__bs__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__bs__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__bs__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__bs__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__bs__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__bs__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__bs__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__bs__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__bs__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__bs__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__bs__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__bs__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__bs__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__bs__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__bs__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__bs__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__bs__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__bs__ The light never goes out .
__bs__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__bs__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__bs__ Can that possibly be true ?
__bs__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__bs__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__bs__ CA : How does it work ?
__bs__ How do people release the documents ?
__bs__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__bs__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__bs__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__bs__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__bs__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__bs__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__bs__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__bs__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__bs__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__bs__ If we can have this document up ...
__bs__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__bs__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__bs__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__bs__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__bs__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__bs__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__bs__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__bs__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__bs__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__bs__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__bs__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__bs__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__bs__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__bs__ And so it came in from the outside .
__bs__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__bs__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__bs__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__bs__ JA : Yep .
__bs__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__bs__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__bs__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__bs__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__bs__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__bs__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__bs__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__bs__ Light &apos; em all up .
__bs__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__bs__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__bs__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__bs__ we need to move , time now !
__bs__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__bs__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__bs__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__bs__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__bs__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__bs__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__bs__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__bs__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__bs__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__bs__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__bs__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__bs__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__bs__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__bs__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__bs__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__bs__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__bs__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__bs__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__bs__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__bs__ I mean , did he ?
__bs__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__bs__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__bs__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__bs__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__bs__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__bs__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__bs__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__bs__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__bs__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__bs__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__bs__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__bs__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__bs__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__bs__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__bs__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__bs__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__bs__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__bs__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__bs__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__bs__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__bs__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__bs__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__bs__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__bs__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__bs__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__bs__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__bs__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__bs__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__bs__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__bs__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__bs__ Light is good .
__bs__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__bs__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__bs__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__bs__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__bs__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__bs__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__bs__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__bs__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__bs__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__bs__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__bs__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__bs__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__bs__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__bs__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__bs__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__bs__ What is this ?
__bs__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__bs__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__bs__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__bs__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__bs__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__bs__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__bs__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__bs__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__bs__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__bs__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__bs__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__bs__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__bs__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__bs__ Yeah .
__bs__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__bs__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__bs__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__bs__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__bs__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__bs__ That &apos;s a problem .
__bs__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__bs__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__bs__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__bs__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__bs__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__bs__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__bs__ Can that be right ?
__bs__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__bs__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__bs__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__bs__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__bs__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__bs__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__bs__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__bs__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__bs__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__bs__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__bs__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__bs__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__bs__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__bs__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__bs__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__bs__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__bs__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__bs__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__bs__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__bs__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__bs__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__bs__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__bs__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__bs__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__bs__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__bs__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__bs__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__bs__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__bs__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__bs__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__bs__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__bs__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__bs__ CA : Wow .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__bs__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__bs__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__bs__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__bs__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__bs__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__bs__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__bs__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__bs__ My name is Amit .
__bs__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__bs__ And it took 18 months .
__bs__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__bs__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__bs__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__bs__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__bs__ And I grew up in India .
__bs__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__bs__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__bs__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__bs__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__bs__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__bs__ You look around at all these museums here .
__bs__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__bs__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__bs__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__bs__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__bs__ You move around , you have fun .
__bs__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__bs__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__bs__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__bs__ Keep going . Have fun .
__bs__ Explore .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__bs__ I see this plus sign .
__bs__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__bs__ Now this is one of the images .
__bs__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__bs__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__bs__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__bs__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__bs__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__bs__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__bs__ You can zoom around very simply .
__bs__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__bs__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__bs__ But then you really want to go deep .
__bs__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__bs__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__bs__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__bs__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__bs__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__bs__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__bs__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__bs__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__bs__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__bs__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__bs__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__bs__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__bs__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__bs__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__bs__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__bs__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__bs__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__bs__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__bs__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__bs__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__bs__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__bs__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__bs__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__bs__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__bs__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__bs__ It really comes from these artists .
__bs__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__bs__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__bs__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__bs__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__bs__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__bs__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__bs__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__bs__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__bs__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__bs__ ( Applause )
