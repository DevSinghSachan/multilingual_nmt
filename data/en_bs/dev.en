__bs__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__bs__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__bs__ Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
__bs__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__bs__ They kill our livestock .
__bs__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__bs__ My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__bs__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__bs__ The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__bs__ So they kill the lions .
__bs__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__bs__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__bs__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__bs__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__bs__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__bs__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
__bs__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__bs__ And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
__bs__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
__bs__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__bs__ So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__bs__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__bs__ So I had an idea .
__bs__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
__bs__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__bs__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__bs__ So I set up everything .
__bs__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
__bs__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__bs__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__bs__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__bs__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__bs__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__bs__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__bs__ One of them was this grandmother .
__bs__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__bs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__bs__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__bs__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__bs__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__bs__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__bs__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__bs__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__bs__ And here I am today .
__bs__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__bs__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__bs__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__bs__ Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__bs__ So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
__bs__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__bs__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__bs__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
__bs__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
__bs__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
__bs__ Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
__bs__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__bs__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__bs__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
__bs__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__bs__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__bs__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__bs__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__bs__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__bs__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__bs__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__bs__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__bs__ Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
__bs__ They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
__bs__ They are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
__bs__ So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
__bs__ Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
__bs__ Useful as the universe &apos;s most massive laboratories .
__bs__ And as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
__bs__ And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big .
__bs__ So , how big ?
__bs__ Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
__bs__ It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it &apos;s being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
__bs__ And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see rings around this cluster .
__bs__ Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
__bs__ It &apos;s just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
__bs__ But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
__bs__ They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
__bs__ And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
__bs__ might be answered by studying these systems .
__bs__ So that was very big .
__bs__ The second things is very hot .
__bs__ Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy cluster , and I subtract away all of the starlight , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blob .
__bs__ This is in false color .
__bs__ It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
__bs__ And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
__bs__ The answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plasma .
__bs__ And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
__bs__ The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
__bs__ So this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
__bs__ There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
__bs__ Third thing : probing the very small .
__bs__ Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
__bs__ Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
__bs__ You were lied to .
__bs__ Most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
__bs__ Dark matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
__bs__ If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
__bs__ And dark matter is no exception .
__bs__ Well , how do we do this ?
__bs__ To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
__bs__ Here is an image .
__bs__ Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
__bs__ They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this bluish purple .
__bs__ The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
__bs__ What &apos;s happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
__bs__ And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
__bs__ So , it &apos;s very funny .
__bs__ The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
__bs__ Fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
__bs__ Certainly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
__bs__ Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
__bs__ If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
__bs__ What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
__bs__ Similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
__bs__ They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
__bs__ They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
__bs__ And , again , we want to learn more about it .
__bs__ So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
__bs__ Depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
__bs__ Well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horribly complicated .
__bs__ Here is a computer simulation .
__bs__ And we need a way to simplify it .
__bs__ Well , I like to think about this using an analogy .
__bs__ If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
__bs__ The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
__bs__ Similarly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
__bs__ So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
__bs__ I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
__bs__ Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
__bs__ He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
__bs__ And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
__bs__ They are not faster horses .
__bs__ They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
__bs__ So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
__bs__ And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ Can geographic information make you healthy ?
__bs__ In 2001 I got hit by a train .
__bs__ My train was a heart attack .
__bs__ I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
__bs__ And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
__bs__ I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
__bs__ &quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
__bs__ So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
__bs__ Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
__bs__ That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
__bs__ Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
__bs__ And you know why I understand that ?
__bs__ Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
__bs__ Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
__bs__ I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
__bs__ But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
__bs__ What does that mean , my environment ?
__bs__ Well , it can mean a lot of things .
__bs__ This is my life . These are my life places .
__bs__ We all have these .
__bs__ While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
__bs__ Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
__bs__ And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
__bs__ You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
__bs__ And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
__bs__ So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
__bs__ And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
__bs__ And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
__bs__ Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
__bs__ I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
__bs__ I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
__bs__ You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
__bs__ And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
__bs__ So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
__bs__ OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
__bs__ Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
__bs__ They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
__bs__ Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
__bs__ And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
__bs__ It was insidious and it was really happening .
__bs__ Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
__bs__ And I moved to Redlands California .
__bs__ Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
__bs__ Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
__bs__ Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
__bs__ If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
__bs__ So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
__bs__ Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
__bs__ The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
__bs__ No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
__bs__ They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
__bs__ They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
__bs__ Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
__bs__ This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
__bs__ Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
__bs__ Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
__bs__ So , how many people are in the white ?
__bs__ How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
__bs__ Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
__bs__ How many have spent it in the red places ?
__bs__ Oh , not so lucky .
__bs__ There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
__bs__ They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
__bs__ But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
__bs__ And it &apos;s not in yours either .
__bs__ So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
__bs__ He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
__bs__ And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
__bs__ And this is where he has spent most of his time .
__bs__ If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
__bs__ Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
__bs__ We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
__bs__ And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
__bs__ Did you know that data existed ?
__bs__ For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
__bs__ So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
__bs__ This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
__bs__ This might be what we end up with .
__bs__ This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
__bs__ This could be my little assessment .
__bs__ And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
__bs__ I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
__bs__ Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
__bs__ It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
__bs__ And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
__bs__ These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
__bs__ The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
__bs__ It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
__bs__ But it will also be useful for us .
__bs__ I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
__bs__ Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
__bs__ With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
__bs__ Just look at that for a minute .
__bs__ That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
__bs__ That was what he was talking about on that quote .
__bs__ And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
__bs__ So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
__bs__ So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
__bs__ And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
__bs__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__bs__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
__bs__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__bs__ Doesn &apos;t say a word — just rolls away with it .
__bs__ Doesn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there .
__bs__ Doesn &apos;t acknowledge the fact that you might need your chair to get some work done today .
__bs__ You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a stink .
__bs__ You &apos;d follow that guy back to his cubicle and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my chair ? &quot; &quot; Okay , so now it &apos;s Tuesday morning and you &apos;re at the office , and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall , and the subject line references some project that you heard a little bit about .
__bs__ But there &apos;s no agenda .
__bs__ There &apos;s no information about why you were invited to the meeting .
__bs__ And yet you accept the meeting invitation , and you go .
__bs__ And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
__bs__ I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
__bs__ In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS : Mindless Accept Syndrome .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar . ( Laughter )
__bs__ It &apos;s an involuntary reflex — ding , click , bing — it &apos;s in your calendar , &quot; &quot; Gotta go , I &apos;m already late for a meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Meetings are important , right ?
__bs__ And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
__bs__ And a well-run meeting can yield really positive , actionable results .
__bs__ But between globalization and pervasive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dramatically over the last few years .
__bs__ And we &apos;re miserable . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re miserable not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good meeting , it &apos;s because of MAS , our Mindless Accept Syndrome , which is a self-inflicted wound .
__bs__ Actually , I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic .
__bs__ Let me tell you why .
__bs__ A couple of years ago , I put a video on Youtube , and in the video , I acted out every terrible conference call you &apos;ve ever been on .
__bs__ It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings .
__bs__ There &apos;s the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
__bs__ There are the participants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
__bs__ The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck .
__bs__ It &apos;s kind of funny .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
__bs__ ( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__bs__ As a group , we need to decide if — bloop bloop — Hi , who just joined ?
__bs__ Hi , it &apos;s Joe . I &apos;m working from home today .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Hi , Joe . Thanks for joining us today , great .
__bs__ Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__bs__ Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
__bs__ &quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
__bs__ &quot; This is my life . &quot;
__bs__ It made me laugh until I cried .
__bs__ And cried . And I cried some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My daily life until retirement or death , sigh . &quot;
__bs__ These are real quotes and it &apos;s real sad .
__bs__ But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
__bs__ In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
__bs__ It &apos;s right at our fingertips , literally .
__bs__ It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No MAS !
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Which , if I remember my high school Spanish , means something like , &quot; &quot; Enough already , make it stop ! &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s how No MAS works . It &apos;s very simple .
__bs__ First of all , the next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn &apos;t have a lot of information in it at all , click the tentative button !
__bs__ It &apos;s right next to the accept button .
__bs__ Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
__bs__ Then , get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting .
__bs__ Tell them you &apos;re very excited to support their work , ask them what the goal of the meeting is , and tell them you &apos;re interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal .
__bs__ And if we do this often enough , and we do it respectfully , people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations .
__bs__ People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
__bs__ Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with .
__bs__ People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours .
__bs__ And they just might bring your chair back , too . ( Laughter ) No MAS !
__bs__ Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause ) .
__bs__ And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
__bs__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__bs__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__bs__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__bs__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__bs__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__bs__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__bs__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__bs__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__bs__ But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
__bs__ Values are a certain kind of fact .
__bs__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__bs__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__bs__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__bs__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__bs__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__bs__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__bs__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__bs__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__bs__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__bs__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
__bs__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__bs__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__bs__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__bs__ Probably not .
__bs__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__bs__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__bs__ And morality relates to these truths .
__bs__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__bs__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__bs__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__bs__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__bs__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__bs__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__bs__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__bs__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__bs__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__bs__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__bs__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__bs__ And these await our discovery .
__bs__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__bs__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__bs__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__bs__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__bs__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__bs__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
__bs__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__bs__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__bs__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__bs__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__bs__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__bs__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__bs__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
__bs__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__bs__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__bs__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__bs__ As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
__bs__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__bs__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__bs__ There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__bs__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
__bs__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__bs__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__bs__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__bs__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__bs__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__bs__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__bs__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__bs__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
__bs__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__bs__ Why would we think this ?
__bs__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__bs__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__bs__ But it clearly admits some exceptions .
__bs__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__bs__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__bs__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__bs__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__bs__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__bs__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__bs__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__bs__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__bs__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
__bs__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__bs__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
__bs__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__bs__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__bs__ Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__bs__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__bs__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__bs__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__bs__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__bs__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__bs__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__bs__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
__bs__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__bs__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__bs__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__bs__ But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__bs__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__bs__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__bs__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__bs__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__bs__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
__bs__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
__bs__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__bs__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__bs__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__bs__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__bs__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__bs__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
__bs__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__bs__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__bs__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__bs__ But this is just the point .
__bs__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__bs__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__bs__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__bs__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__bs__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__bs__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__bs__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__bs__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__bs__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__bs__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__bs__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__bs__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__bs__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__bs__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__bs__ It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__bs__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__bs__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__bs__ Thank you very much .
__bs__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
__bs__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__bs__ Language seems to be really important here .
__bs__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__bs__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__bs__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__bs__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
__bs__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__bs__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__bs__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
__bs__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__bs__ But can you reconcile that ?
__bs__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__bs__ Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__bs__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__bs__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__bs__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__bs__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__bs__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__bs__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__bs__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__bs__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__bs__ SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
__bs__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__bs__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__bs__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__bs__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__bs__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__bs__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__bs__ ( Applause )
