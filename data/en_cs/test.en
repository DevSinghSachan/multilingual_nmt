__cs__ By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
__cs__ The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
__cs__ While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
__cs__ What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
__cs__ And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
__cs__ Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
__cs__ In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
__cs__ Consider a few stats for a moment .
__cs__ Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
__cs__ There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
__cs__ And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
__cs__ So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
__cs__ But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
__cs__ And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
__cs__ Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
__cs__ Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
__cs__ One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
__cs__ ( Recording ) Adam Ostrow : Hello .
__cs__ Death : Adam ?
__cs__ AO : Yeah .
__cs__ Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
__cs__ AO : Who is this ?
__cs__ Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
__cs__ So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
__cs__ Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
__cs__ And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
__cs__ But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
__cs__ Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
__cs__ I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
__cs__ And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
__cs__ Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
__cs__ One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
__cs__ Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
__cs__ You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
__cs__ Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
__cs__ But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
__cs__ Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
__cs__ What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
__cs__ I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
__cs__ Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
__cs__ Thank you very much .

__cs__ People returning to work after a career break : I call them relaunchers .
__cs__ These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care , for childcare reasons , pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue .
__cs__ Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds : veterans , military spouses , retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats .
__cs__ Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers .
__cs__ This disconnect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
__cs__ Now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
__cs__ This is Sami Kafala .
__cs__ He &apos;s a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children .
__cs__ The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks .
__cs__ And speaking of long career breaks , this is Mimi Kahn .
__cs__ She &apos;s a social worker in Orange County , California , who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break .
__cs__ That &apos;s the longest career break that I &apos;m aware of .
__cs__ Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O &apos;Connor took a five-year career break early in her career .
__cs__ And this is Tracy Shapiro , who took a 13-year career break .
__cs__ Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it .
__cs__ Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home , but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work , plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working .
__cs__ Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we &apos;ve put in a good day in the job search .
__cs__ She was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
__cs__ I met Tracy in June of 2011 , when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around .
__cs__ The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house .
__cs__ I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__cs__ I also told her , &quot; &quot; You are going to have a lot of conversations that don &apos;t go anywhere .
__cs__ Expect that , and don &apos;t be discouraged by it .
__cs__ There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit , but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce .
__cs__ And that is , that people &apos;s view of you is frozen in time .
__cs__ What I mean by this is , when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past , the people with whom you worked or went to school , they are going to remember you as you were before your career break .
__cs__ And that &apos;s even if your sense of self has diminished over time , as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities .
__cs__ So for example , you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this .
__cs__ This is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan .
__cs__ Or here I am in the kitchen .
__cs__ But those people from the past , they don &apos;t know about any of this .
__cs__ They only remember you as you were , and it &apos;s a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work .
__cs__ There &apos;s one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break .
__cs__ And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news .
__cs__ My background is in finance , and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children .
__cs__ So I was afraid I &apos;d go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn &apos;t exist anymore .
__cs__ So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again .
__cs__ I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here &apos;s why .
__cs__ Think about our life stage : for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
__cs__ We did that already .
__cs__ We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations .
__cs__ We &apos;re in a more settled time of life .
__cs__ We have great work experience .
__cs__ We have a more mature perspective .
__cs__ We &apos;re not trying to find ourselves at an employer &apos;s expense .
__cs__ Plus we have an energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we &apos;ve been away from it for a while .
__cs__ On the flip side , I speak with employers , and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers .
__cs__ The first one is , employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete .
__cs__ Now , I can tell you , having been technologically obsolete myself at one point , that it &apos;s a temporary condition .
__cs__ I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3 .
__cs__ I don &apos;t know if anyone can even remember back that far , but I had to relearn it on Excel .
__cs__ It actually wasn &apos;t that hard . A lot of the commands are the same .
__cs__ I found PowerPoint much more challenging , but now I use PowerPoint all the time .
__cs__ I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software .
__cs__ And if they &apos;re not up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to get there .
__cs__ And they do .
__cs__ The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they &apos;re worried that relaunchers don &apos;t know what they want to do .
__cs__ I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
__cs__ That &apos;s not the employer &apos;s job .
__cs__ It &apos;s the relauncher &apos;s responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value .
__cs__ Back in 2010 I started noticing something .
__cs__ I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008 , and in 2010 , I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity , whether it was called an internship or not , but an internship-like experience , as a way for professionals to return to work .
__cs__ I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs .
__cs__ I saw a returning engineer , a nontraditional reentry candidate , apply for an entry-level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
__cs__ I saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs .
__cs__ So I wrote a report about what I was seeing , and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called &quot; &quot; The 40-Year-Old Intern . &quot; &quot; I have to thank the editors there for that title , and also for this artwork where you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns .
__cs__ And then , courtesy of Fox Business News , they called the concept &quot; &quot; The 50-Year-Old Intern . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals .
__cs__ And at this point , hundreds of people have participated .
__cs__ These internships are paid , and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries .
__cs__ And now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers .
__cs__ Now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
__cs__ Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews , and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over .
__cs__ This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
__cs__ Think about how far we have come .
__cs__ Before this , most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all .
__cs__ But now , not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind , but you can &apos;t even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé .
__cs__ This is the mark of real change , of true institutional shift , because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers , we can solve it for other career transitioners too .
__cs__ In fact , an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program .
__cs__ And there &apos;s no reason why there can &apos;t be a retiree internship program .
__cs__ Different pool , same concept .
__cs__ So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro .
__cs__ Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
__cs__ Well , one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy , and it was an accounting job in a finance department .
__cs__ But it was a temp job .
__cs__ The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more , but no guarantees .
__cs__ This was in the fall of 2011 .
__cs__ Tracy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
__cs__ So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role , she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best .
__cs__ Well , she ended up blowing away all of their expectations , and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of 2012 , but they made it even more interesting and challenging , because they knew what Tracy could handle .
__cs__ Fast forward to 2015 , Tracy &apos;s been promoted .
__cs__ They &apos;ve paid for her to get her MBA at night .
__cs__ She &apos;s even hired another relauncher to work for her .
__cs__ Tracy &apos;s temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer .
__cs__ Now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
__cs__ But in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , don &apos;t hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
__cs__ Be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
__cs__ Thank you .

__cs__ Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
__cs__ Now I work in the solar technology industry .
__cs__ And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
__cs__ ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
__cs__ It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
__cs__ Huh . Hang on a moment .
__cs__ It might take a moment to load .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
__cs__ No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
__cs__ ( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
__cs__ Okay . ( Laughter )
__cs__ Solar technology is ...
__cs__ Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
__cs__ Okay . Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority .
__cs__ Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
__cs__ Then , predictions can be made and tested .
__cs__ So what do we know about complex systems ?
__cs__ So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
__cs__ Where are economic networks ?
__cs__ What we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
__cs__ And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
__cs__ How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
__cs__ These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
__cs__ Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
__cs__ Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors .
__cs__ We call ourselves Pors and Rao , and we live and work in India .
__cs__ I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigarettes .
__cs__ And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
__cs__ But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family .
__cs__ And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone .
__cs__ He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him .
__cs__ And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Uncle Phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
__cs__ It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
__cs__ But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his commands .
__cs__ And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
__cs__ So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the carriage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
__cs__ This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
__cs__ So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital .
__cs__ So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
__cs__ And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
__cs__ The next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; &quot; The Pygmies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
__cs__ So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
__cs__ And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of creep out .
__cs__ And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their necks out .
__cs__ And at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
__cs__ So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
__cs__ And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them .
__cs__ So this is how it works .
__cs__ This is a video prototype .
__cs__ So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
__cs__ And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
__cs__ So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .
__cs__ And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
__cs__ You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
__cs__ ( Noise ) But they react to foreground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
__cs__ ( Whistling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
__cs__ So each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
__cs__ So this is a very early prototype .
__cs__ Of course , it got much better after that .
__cs__ And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
__cs__ This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Missing Person . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .
__cs__ How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
__cs__ So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
__cs__ So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
__cs__ On the right side you can see my colleague Soren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
__cs__ And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
__cs__ Soren enters the room . Pop ! He goes invisible .
__cs__ And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing .
__cs__ It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet dealt with the overlap and all of that , but that got refined pretty soon , later .
__cs__ So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
__cs__ And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
__cs__ So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Shadow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
__cs__ And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
__cs__ So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some crap laying around .
__cs__ But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion .
__cs__ And it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .
__cs__ His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his hat , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
__cs__ Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement .
__cs__ And it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
__cs__ Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .
__cs__ And there &apos;s no wires .
__cs__ So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activates this object .
__cs__ And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
__cs__ And this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
__cs__ But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of manages to pull itself up .
__cs__ So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics .
__cs__ And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
__cs__ So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
__cs__ That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
__cs__ Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
__cs__ But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
__cs__ So this is a work that we were very intrigued with , working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics , which twinkle like the night sky .
__cs__ And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
__cs__ So we wrapped this around a blob-like form , which is in the shape of a teddy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
__cs__ And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
__cs__ And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky .
__cs__ So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space Filler . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approached it , it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
__cs__ And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something .
__cs__ So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
__cs__ But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
__cs__ And once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I love the Internet .
__cs__ It &apos;s true .
__cs__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__cs__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__cs__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__cs__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__cs__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__cs__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__cs__ So let me show you something .
__cs__ This here is Brain .
__cs__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__cs__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__cs__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__cs__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__cs__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__cs__ All right .
__cs__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__cs__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__cs__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Now , 1986 .
__cs__ Now it &apos;s 2011 .
__cs__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__cs__ The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
__cs__ So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
__cs__ So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
__cs__ This is from the city of Lahore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad , where Bin Laden was caught .
__cs__ Here &apos;s a typical street view .
__cs__ And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .
__cs__ And I knocked on the door .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
__cs__ Basit and Amjad ; they are still there .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Basit .
__cs__ Sitting down is his brother Amjad .
__cs__ These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
__cs__ Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
__cs__ I asked them why .
__cs__ I asked them how they feel about what they started .
__cs__ And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .
__cs__ So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
__cs__ Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
__cs__ So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
__cs__ What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .
__cs__ So let me just mount some drives . Go over there .
__cs__ What we have here is a list of old viruses .
__cs__ So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
__cs__ For example , let &apos;s go with the Centipede virus first .
__cs__ And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
__cs__ You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
__cs__ Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Crash , invented in Russia in 1992 .
__cs__ Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
__cs__ ( Siren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Walker virus does ?
__cs__ Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
__cs__ So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__cs__ Today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
__cs__ Today , viruses are a global problem .
__cs__ What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
__cs__ So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .
__cs__ In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of malware we find every single day .
__cs__ Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Server.exe.
__cs__ And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
__cs__ And if we just scroll around , it &apos;s just massive .
__cs__ We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
__cs__ And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day .
__cs__ So where are all these coming from then ?
__cs__ Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
__cs__ It &apos;s gangs like — let &apos;s go to GangstaBucks.com.
__cs__ This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .
__cs__ So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of infecting Windows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
__cs__ And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
__cs__ So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
__cs__ Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers .
__cs__ Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
__cs__ So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google searches .
__cs__ Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
__cs__ Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
__cs__ Same thing with every single password and so on .
__cs__ But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .
__cs__ Because when you do purchases in online stores , you will be typing in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
__cs__ And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
__cs__ That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the expiration date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
__cs__ Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
__cs__ And that , obviously , is a problem .
__cs__ We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .
__cs__ One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .
__cs__ We find guys like Bjorn Sundin , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages , Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain , a U.S. citizen .
__cs__ These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. , a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .
__cs__ They are both right now on the run .
__cs__ Nobody knows where they are .
__cs__ U.S. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it .
__cs__ So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .
__cs__ And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
__cs__ We know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with SQL databases .
__cs__ And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
__cs__ They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
__cs__ I mean , the Internet is international .
__cs__ That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
__cs__ And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Clarified Networks , which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .
__cs__ This operation , believed to be originally from Estonia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
__cs__ So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
__cs__ They will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
__cs__ So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .
__cs__ Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
__cs__ So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
__cs__ How do you actually track them down ?
__cs__ Let me give you an example .
__cs__ What we have here is one exploit file .
__cs__ Here , I &apos;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file , which contains an exploit .
__cs__ And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
__cs__ Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image header , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
__cs__ And that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
__cs__ It has been encrypted with XOR function 97 .
__cs__ You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
__cs__ And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
__cs__ Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .
__cs__ And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
__cs__ But just keep staring at it .
__cs__ You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
__cs__ And that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer .
__cs__ But even more interestingly , if we continue decrypting , we &apos;ll find this mysterious string , which says O600KO78RUS .
__cs__ That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
__cs__ It &apos;s not used for anything .
__cs__ And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
__cs__ So obviously I Googled for it .
__cs__ I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
__cs__ So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
__cs__ And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in RUS like Russia .
__cs__ And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg .
__cs__ For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .
__cs__ So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
__cs__ Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .
__cs__ And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St. Petersburg — he &apos;s in his early 20s — about his cat , about his girlfriend .
__cs__ And he drives a very nice car .
__cs__ In fact , this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
__cs__ Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg .
__cs__ How do I know about this car ?
__cs__ Because he blogged about the car .
__cs__ He actually had a car accident .
__cs__ In downtown St. Petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
__cs__ And he put blogged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mercedes — right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .
__cs__ And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .
__cs__ And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .
__cs__ Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
__cs__ Well in most cases it never gets this far .
__cs__ The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
__cs__ And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
__cs__ The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
__cs__ I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
__cs__ But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
__cs__ You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet .
__cs__ So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .
__cs__ That &apos;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC , programmable logic &#91; controller &#93; .
__cs__ And this is what runs our infrastructure .
__cs__ This is what runs everything around us .
__cs__ PLC &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programmed , are put in place , and they do their job .
__cs__ For example , the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
__cs__ And when Stuxnet infects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
__cs__ Because everything around us is being run by these .
__cs__ I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
__cs__ You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
__cs__ Everything is being run by computers .
__cs__ Everything is reliant on these computers working .
__cs__ We have become very reliant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
__cs__ And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
__cs__ We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
__cs__ It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
__cs__ Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
__cs__ Think about all the services we have online .
__cs__ Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
__cs__ I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
__cs__ I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
__cs__ Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
__cs__ We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
__cs__ What we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs — these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .
__cs__ That &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
__cs__ What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
__cs__ We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__cs__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__cs__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__cs__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__cs__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__cs__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__cs__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__cs__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__cs__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__cs__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__cs__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__cs__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__cs__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__cs__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__cs__ This is an illusion .
__cs__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__cs__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__cs__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__cs__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__cs__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__cs__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__cs__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__cs__ We can &apos;t .
__cs__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__cs__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__cs__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__cs__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__cs__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__cs__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__cs__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__cs__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__cs__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__cs__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__cs__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__cs__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__cs__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__cs__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__cs__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__cs__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__cs__ And what does it mean ?
__cs__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__cs__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__cs__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__cs__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__cs__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__cs__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__cs__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__cs__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__cs__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__cs__ One country , two systems .
__cs__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__cs__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__cs__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__cs__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__cs__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__cs__ What happened ?
__cs__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__cs__ One nation , one system .
__cs__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__cs__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__cs__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__cs__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__cs__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__cs__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__cs__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__cs__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__cs__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__cs__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__cs__ So the question is , why ?
__cs__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__cs__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__cs__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__cs__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__cs__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__cs__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__cs__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__cs__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__cs__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__cs__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__cs__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__cs__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__cs__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__cs__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__cs__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__cs__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__cs__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__cs__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__cs__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__cs__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__cs__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__cs__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__cs__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__cs__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__cs__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__cs__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__cs__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__cs__ The state is everywhere in China .
__cs__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__cs__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__cs__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__cs__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__cs__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__cs__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__cs__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__cs__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__cs__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__cs__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__cs__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__cs__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__cs__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__cs__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__cs__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__cs__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__cs__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__cs__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__cs__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__cs__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__cs__ But it &apos;s not .
__cs__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__cs__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__cs__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__cs__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__cs__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__cs__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__cs__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__cs__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__cs__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__cs__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__cs__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__cs__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__cs__ And there are two consequences of this .
__cs__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__cs__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__cs__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__cs__ When did that last happen ?
__cs__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__cs__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__cs__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__cs__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__cs__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__cs__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__cs__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__cs__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__cs__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__cs__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__cs__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__cs__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__cs__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__cs__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__cs__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__cs__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__cs__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__cs__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__cs__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__cs__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__cs__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__cs__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__cs__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__cs__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__cs__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__cs__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__cs__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__cs__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__cs__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__cs__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__cs__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__cs__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__cs__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
__cs__ Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
__cs__ By revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
__cs__ Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
__cs__ We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
__cs__ And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
__cs__ You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
__cs__ I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
__cs__ And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
__cs__ We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
__cs__ There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
__cs__ We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
__cs__ And there we are , not just last in the E.U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
__cs__ And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
__cs__ We &apos;re the saddest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the saddest place on Earth .
__cs__ That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
__cs__ Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
__cs__ Last in reading , math and science . Last .
__cs__ Business : The lowest perception in the E.U.
__cs__ that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
__cs__ Why as a result , what happens ?
__cs__ The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
__cs__ And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
__cs__ We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
__cs__ So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
__cs__ Last in Europe GDP per capita .
__cs__ Last .
__cs__ So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
__cs__ We &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
__cs__ And these are facts , guys .
__cs__ This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
__cs__ It &apos;s not .
__cs__ It &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . These are facts .
__cs__ So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
__cs__ The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
__cs__ We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
__cs__ How did this happen ?
__cs__ Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
__cs__ I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be drastic to some of you — because we are handicapping ourselves .
__cs__ We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
__cs__ I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
__cs__ In case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
__cs__ Babies play , kids play , adults play .
__cs__ We don &apos;t value play .
__cs__ In fact , we devalue play .
__cs__ And we devalue it in three areas .
__cs__ Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
__cs__ Social : 45 years of what ?
__cs__ Of communism — of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-expression and innovation .
__cs__ And instead , what do we value ?
__cs__ Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
__cs__ To be serious .
__cs__ To be really , really serious .
__cs__ It did .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Be serious .
__cs__ I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
__cs__ Heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water — that will kill them .
__cs__ I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
__cs__ We have a serious meme running through .
__cs__ It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
__cs__ It &apos;s a serious gene .
__cs__ It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; baba factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
__cs__ Step one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . Iskam baby . &quot; &quot; Step two : we get the baby . Woohoo !
__cs__ But then what happens in step three ?
__cs__ I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to give bebko to baba .
__cs__ But we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
__cs__ So what happens ?
__cs__ She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the redwood trees — for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
__cs__ What happens then ?
__cs__ It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , memorization and standardization , and devalues self-expression , self-exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
__cs__ It &apos;s a crap system .
__cs__ True story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
__cs__ We went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
__cs__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and recess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Ha . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
__cs__ And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mindless , robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes .
__cs__ But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
__cs__ We need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
__cs__ We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
__cs__ But no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
__cs__ We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
__cs__ What are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
__cs__ Autocratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
__cs__ I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
__cs__ Untrusting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Controlling — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
__cs__ So they &apos;re restrictive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.M.
__cs__ That &apos;s somehow unprofessional and bad .
__cs__ And at the end of the day , it &apos;s unfulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
__cs__ In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
__cs__ And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
__cs__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dumb idea .
__cs__ It can &apos;t be because of play .
__cs__ Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious meme in us .
__cs__ Well I &apos;m going to say no .
__cs__ And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
__cs__ Play : our brains are hardwired for play .
__cs__ Evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
__cs__ And you know what ?
__cs__ Evolution does a really , really good job of deselecting traits that aren &apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
__cs__ Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
__cs__ Throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . Ants play .
__cs__ Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
__cs__ But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
__cs__ Rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
__cs__ Kittens play . We all know kittens play .
__cs__ But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
__cs__ They can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
__cs__ Bears play .
__cs__ But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
__cs__ It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
__cs__ It &apos;s the ones that play more .
__cs__ And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
__cs__ The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
__cs__ Dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
__cs__ But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
__cs__ Yours truly : humans .
__cs__ Kids play , we play — of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
__cs__ It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
__cs__ And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
__cs__ Really cool term : neoteny — the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
__cs__ And who are the biggest neotenists ?
__cs__ Humans . We play sports .
__cs__ We do it for fun , or as Olympians , or as professionals .
__cs__ We play musical instruments .
__cs__ We dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
__cs__ We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
__cs__ We &apos;re designed to do that continuously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
__cs__ It is a huge benefit .
__cs__ Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
__cs__ For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
__cs__ It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening .
__cs__ As a result , what happens ?
__cs__ We develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
__cs__ We develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
__cs__ These guys are facts .
__cs__ It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
__cs__ These are the benefits to play .
__cs__ It is a genetic birthright that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
__cs__ And if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have .
__cs__ We hold ourselves back .
__cs__ Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
__cs__ Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
__cs__ What does this world look like ?
__cs__ It &apos;s pretty bleak .
__cs__ It &apos;s pretty glum .
__cs__ Now imagine your workplace .
__cs__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__cs__ Or maybe the workplace of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
__cs__ Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
__cs__ Or is it crap ? Is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling ?
__cs__ We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
__cs__ We even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
__cs__ &quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
__cs__ He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
__cs__ The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
__cs__ is depression . It &apos;s depression .
__cs__ In fact , play improves our work .
__cs__ Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
__cs__ For example , it stimulates creativity .
__cs__ It increases our openness to change .
__cs__ It improves our ability to learn .
__cs__ It provides a sense of purpose and mastery — two key motivational things that increase productivity , through play .
__cs__ So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean frivolous .
__cs__ You know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
__cs__ He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
__cs__ A doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
__cs__ Our thinking is backwards .
__cs__ We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
__cs__ We should be celebrating play .
__cs__ Quick example from the corporate world .
__cs__ FedEx , easy motto : people , service , profit .
__cs__ If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
__cs__ What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
__cs__ And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
__cs__ And what do great customers do , great-feeling customers ?
__cs__ They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
__cs__ People , service , profit .
__cs__ Play increases productivity , not decreases .
__cs__ And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Gee , that can work for FedEx out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in Bulgaria .
__cs__ No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in Bulgaria , you guys . Two reasons .
__cs__ One , play is universal .
__cs__ There &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious meme that we have to kick out .
__cs__ Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sciant .
__cs__ When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
__cs__ Not one customer would refer us .
__cs__ I asked them all .
__cs__ We had marginal profit — I did .
__cs__ We had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
__cs__ Through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not autocracy , the things like having a results-focus .
__cs__ I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
__cs__ I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
__cs__ Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;clock ?
__cs__ Basically promoting fun .
__cs__ Through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sciant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
__cs__ And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
__cs__ Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
__cs__ It does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
__cs__ There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
__cs__ So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
__cs__ First of all , you have to believe me .
__cs__ If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
__cs__ Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
__cs__ Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
__cs__ I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
__cs__ Rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
__cs__ You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution .
__cs__ You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
__cs__ You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; Weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
__cs__ Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
__cs__ We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
__cs__ We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
__cs__ Fear is the enemy of play .
__cs__ And we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
__cs__ You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven forbid .
__cs__ Let them be on the Internet .
__cs__ Let them be on instant messengers .
__cs__ Let them take long lunches .
__cs__ Lunch is like the recess for work .
__cs__ It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
__cs__ Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the workplace .
__cs__ We spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
__cs__ Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__cs__ We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
__cs__ What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising . What we need is a players &apos; uprising .
__cs__ Seriously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the uprising . But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
__cs__ of what worked about reinvigorating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
__cs__ Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__cs__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__cs__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__cs__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__cs__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__cs__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__cs__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__cs__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__cs__ This is a time of need .
__cs__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__cs__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__cs__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__cs__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__cs__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__cs__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__cs__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__cs__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__cs__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__cs__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__cs__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__cs__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__cs__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__cs__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__cs__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__cs__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__cs__ The earth moved for both of them .
__cs__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__cs__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__cs__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__cs__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__cs__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__cs__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__cs__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__cs__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
__cs__ I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Skeptical Environmentalist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
__cs__ And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
__cs__ So get out your pen and paper .
__cs__ Bottom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
__cs__ I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
__cs__ There are 800 million people starving .
__cs__ There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
__cs__ Two billion people without sanitation .
__cs__ There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
__cs__ The lists go on and on .
__cs__ There &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change — so on .
__cs__ There are many , many problems out there .
__cs__ In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
__cs__ We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
__cs__ And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
__cs__ And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
__cs__ If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
__cs__ We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communicable diseases , conflicts , education , financial instability , governance and corruption , malnutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsidies and trade barriers .
__cs__ We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world .
__cs__ The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
__cs__ Where should we start on solving these problems ?
__cs__ But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
__cs__ That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January .
__cs__ But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
__cs__ Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
__cs__ Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
__cs__ But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
__cs__ So the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
__cs__ And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
__cs__ To climate change that would be like Kyoto .
__cs__ To communicable diseases , it might be health clinics or mosquito nets .
__cs__ To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peacekeeping forces , and so on .
__cs__ The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
__cs__ And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
__cs__ What should be at the bottom of the list ?
__cs__ Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
__cs__ The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substantial amount of my time , right ?
__cs__ I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
__cs__ And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually prioritize ?
__cs__ Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
__cs__ And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable .
__cs__ Nobody wants to do this .
__cs__ Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
__cs__ But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
__cs__ And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
__cs__ We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
__cs__ So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not prioritizing — any decision is a prioritization , so of course we are still prioritizing , if only implicitly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization , and went in and talked about it .
__cs__ So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
__cs__ There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
__cs__ We have not had an idea .
__cs__ Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
__cs__ You know , you have a pizza ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
__cs__ It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
__cs__ It could be a family-size pizza ; it could be a very individual-size pizza , right ?
__cs__ We &apos;d like to know these things .
__cs__ And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
__cs__ And so basically , this has been the Copenhagen Consensus &apos; process .
__cs__ We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
__cs__ So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
__cs__ What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
__cs__ Likewise in communicable diseases .
__cs__ Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
__cs__ What would be the price ?
__cs__ What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
__cs__ And so on .
__cs__ Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel Laureates , meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 .
__cs__ We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics .
__cs__ That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
__cs__ And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
__cs__ And then you ask , why economists ?
__cs__ And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
__cs__ The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
__cs__ If you want to know about climate , you ask a climatologist .
__cs__ But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
__cs__ That is what economists do .
__cs__ They prioritize .
__cs__ They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
__cs__ So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
__cs__ Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
__cs__ They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
__cs__ Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
__cs__ And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
__cs__ These were the bad projects .
__cs__ As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
__cs__ This offends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
__cs__ And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
__cs__ Why is it it came up ?
__cs__ And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
__cs__ The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto — or doing something more than Kyoto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
__cs__ It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
__cs__ It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
__cs__ But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
__cs__ What they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that Kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
__cs__ That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
__cs__ That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
__cs__ Yet it would do very little good .
__cs__ All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100 .
__cs__ So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
__cs__ Which is a little good , but not very much good .
__cs__ So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
__cs__ And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
__cs__ We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
__cs__ So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
__cs__ Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
__cs__ And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
__cs__ It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
__cs__ But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first priority .
__cs__ The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
__cs__ It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very costly .
__cs__ Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
__cs__ If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
__cs__ Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
__cs__ So I &apos;d like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
__cs__ The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
__cs__ The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
__cs__ It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
__cs__ If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
__cs__ We could avoid about 500,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
__cs__ We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
__cs__ This third best one was free trade .
__cs__ Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accrue to the Third World .
__cs__ Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
__cs__ That would be the third best thing we could do .
__cs__ The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
__cs__ Not just malnutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition , namely , the lack of micronutrients .
__cs__ Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is lacking in iron , zinc , iodine and vitamin A.
__cs__ If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
__cs__ That would be the second best investment that we could do .
__cs__ And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
__cs__ Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
__cs__ Again , what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
__cs__ One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
__cs__ And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
__cs__ But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
__cs__ And treatment is much , much more expensive than prevention .
__cs__ So basically , what this focuses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .
__cs__ Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
__cs__ So again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
__cs__ What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
__cs__ I &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
__cs__ Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
__cs__ Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
__cs__ I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
__cs__ We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
__cs__ But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
__cs__ There are many problems out there in the world .
__cs__ And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
__cs__ The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
__cs__ And I think , actually — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
__cs__ One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
__cs__ Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
__cs__ estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today .
__cs__ Much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
__cs__ And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
__cs__ But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangladeshi .
__cs__ We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
__cs__ And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
__cs__ Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very cheaply ?
__cs__ Or as Schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bolivian , a rich Congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
__cs__ Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
__cs__ Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
__cs__ We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tomorrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
__cs__ It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
__cs__ So in many ways , I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems .
__cs__ To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
__cs__ It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
__cs__ The other objections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — positing a false choice .
__cs__ Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
__cs__ I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
__cs__ In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
__cs__ Since then our aid has halved .
__cs__ So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
__cs__ Likewise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
__cs__ You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
__cs__ I &apos;m all for that .
__cs__ If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
__cs__ But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
__cs__ So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities .
__cs__ I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
__cs__ You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inevitably end up asking old , white American men .
__cs__ And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
__cs__ So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
__cs__ The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
__cs__ The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
__cs__ They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
__cs__ And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
__cs__ We &apos;ve done this many other times .
__cs__ There &apos;s been many other seminars and university students , and different things .
__cs__ They all come out with very much the same list .
__cs__ And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
__cs__ Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
__cs__ But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
__cs__ I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process .
__cs__ We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
__cs__ Map out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political triage .
__cs__ To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these , but we have to be honest and frank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
__cs__ If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
__cs__ So I hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ Our world has many superheroes .
__cs__ But they have the worst of all superpowers : invisibility .
__cs__ For example , the catadores , workers who collect recyclable materials for a living .
__cs__ Catadores emerged from social inequality , unemployment , and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the waste collection system .
__cs__ Catadores provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . But they are not acknowledged for it .
__cs__ Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
__cs__ Most of the catadores work independently , picking waste from the streets and selling to junk yards at very low prices .
__cs__ They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags , shopping carts , bicycles and carroças .
__cs__ Carroças are carts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil , much like graffiti and street art .
__cs__ And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes .
__cs__ I am a graffiti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
__cs__ In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças , as a new urban support for my message .
__cs__ But at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
__cs__ By adding art and humor to the cause , it became more appealing , which helped call attention to the catadores and improve their self-esteem .
__cs__ And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
__cs__ So , the thing is , I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
__cs__ I have painted over 200 carroças in many cities and have been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide .
__cs__ And then I realized that catadores , in their invisibility , are not exclusive to Brazil .
__cs__ I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
__cs__ And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
__cs__ And then , I created a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crowdfunded event .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) .
__cs__ So Pimp My Carroça is a large crowdfunded event to help catadores and their carroças .
__cs__ Catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare , like physicians , dentists , podiatrists , hair stylists , massage therapists and much more .
__cs__ But also , they also receive safety shirts , gloves , raincoats and eyeglasses to see in high-definition the city , while their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers .
__cs__ And then they receive safety items , too : reflective tapes , horns and mirrors .
__cs__ Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
__cs__ Pimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba .
__cs__ But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created Pimpx , which is inspired by TEDx , and it &apos;s a simplified , do-it-yourself , crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça .
__cs__ So now everybody can join .
__cs__ In two years , over 170 catadores , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 donors have been involved in the Pimp My Carroça movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school .
__cs__ So catadores are leaving invisibility behind and becoming increasingly respected and valued .
__cs__ Because of their pimped carroças , they are able to fight back to prejudice , increase their income and their interaction with society .
__cs__ So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledging the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city .
__cs__ Try to see the world as one , without boundaries or frontiers .
__cs__ Believe it or not , there are over 20 million catadores worldwide .
__cs__ So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
__cs__ Muito obrigado , thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) .
__cs__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__cs__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__cs__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__cs__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__cs__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__cs__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__cs__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__cs__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__cs__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__cs__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__cs__ We get it in the abstract .
__cs__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__cs__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__cs__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__cs__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__cs__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__cs__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__cs__ I think this is a problem .
__cs__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__cs__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__cs__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__cs__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__cs__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__cs__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__cs__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__cs__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__cs__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__cs__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__cs__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__cs__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__cs__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__cs__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__cs__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__cs__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__cs__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__cs__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__cs__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__cs__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__cs__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__cs__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__cs__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__cs__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__cs__ I call this error blindness .
__cs__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__cs__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__cs__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__cs__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__cs__ This is not mine , by the way .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__cs__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__cs__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__cs__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__cs__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__cs__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__cs__ Okay , so fine .
__cs__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__cs__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__cs__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__cs__ So let me tell you a story .
__cs__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__cs__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__cs__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__cs__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__cs__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__cs__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__cs__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__cs__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__cs__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__cs__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__cs__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__cs__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__cs__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__cs__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__cs__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__cs__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__cs__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__cs__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__cs__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__cs__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__cs__ So this is a catastrophe .
__cs__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__cs__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__cs__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__cs__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__cs__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__cs__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__cs__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__cs__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__cs__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__cs__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__cs__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__cs__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__cs__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__cs__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__cs__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__cs__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__cs__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__cs__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__cs__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__cs__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__cs__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__cs__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__cs__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__cs__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__cs__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__cs__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__cs__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__cs__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__cs__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__cs__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__cs__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__cs__ And something else happened instead .
__cs__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__cs__ And something else happened instead .
__cs__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__cs__ And something else happened instead .
__cs__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__cs__ And something else happened instead .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__cs__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__cs__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__cs__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__cs__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__cs__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__cs__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__cs__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__cs__ We come up with another idea .
__cs__ We tell another story .
__cs__ We hold another conference .
__cs__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__cs__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__cs__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__cs__ On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League .
__cs__ Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder , but while serving time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations headquarters .
__cs__ Thankfully , those plans were foiled by an FBI informant .
__cs__ Sadly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not .
__cs__ Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot .
__cs__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__cs__ I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
__cs__ It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
__cs__ My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
__cs__ It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
__cs__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__cs__ A few months prior to his arrest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
__cs__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__cs__ We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range , which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI .
__cs__ When it was my turn to shoot , my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off .
__cs__ That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .
__cs__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__cs__ They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
__cs__ They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
__cs__ Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others .
__cs__ These were the men I looked up to .
__cs__ These were the men I called ammu , which means uncle .
__cs__ By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that instability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
__cs__ Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
__cs__ Being the perpetual new face in class , I was frequently the target of bullies .
__cs__ I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition .
__cs__ So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
__cs__ For those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigoted household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world .
__cs__ I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
__cs__ So what opened my eyes ?
__cs__ One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .
__cs__ Through a college prep program , I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia .
__cs__ My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
__cs__ The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
__cs__ One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish .
__cs__ Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us .
__cs__ I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable .
__cs__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
__cs__ There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
__cs__ Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
__cs__ As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kindest , least judgmental people I had ever met .
__cs__ Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
__cs__ Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
__cs__ I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acquainted with being judged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
__cs__ Then there was &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; On a nightly basis , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
__cs__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__cs__ Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me .
__cs__ One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live .
__cs__ She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of hating people . &quot;
__cs__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__cs__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__cs__ I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
__cs__ So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
__cs__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__cs__ I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subjected to this violent , intolerant ideology , that I did not become fanaticized .
__cs__ Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
__cs__ I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
__cs__ For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father &apos;s actions .
__cs__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__cs__ I am not my father .
__cs__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m delighted to be here .
__cs__ I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
__cs__ I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
__cs__ First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
__cs__ I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
__cs__ So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
__cs__ And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
__cs__ And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
__cs__ I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
__cs__ It &apos;s tedious .
__cs__ I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
__cs__ The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
__cs__ A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
__cs__ I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
__cs__ So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
__cs__ Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
__cs__ I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
__cs__ My idea is : no ! No !
__cs__ Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
__cs__ And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
__cs__ So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
__cs__ It probably has lies in it as well .
__cs__ Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
__cs__ I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
__cs__ Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
__cs__ In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
__cs__ No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
__cs__ No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
__cs__ They know .
__cs__ In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
__cs__ They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
__cs__ I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
__cs__ Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
__cs__ But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
__cs__ What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
__cs__ Change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
__cs__ But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
__cs__ I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
__cs__ Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
__cs__ Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
__cs__ I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
__cs__ Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
__cs__ Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
__cs__ This is a Klein bottle .
__cs__ For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
__cs__ It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
__cs__ It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
__cs__ It has wonderful properties .
__cs__ If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
__cs__ And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
__cs__ Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
__cs__ But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
__cs__ This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
__cs__ And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
__cs__ So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
__cs__ That was a month of my life .
__cs__ But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
__cs__ Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
__cs__ Could somebody put this guy up ?
__cs__ And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
__cs__ And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
__cs__ As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
__cs__ Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
__cs__ And it sent me back .
__cs__ Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
__cs__ This guy over here of course is me .
__cs__ This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
__cs__ Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
__cs__ A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
__cs__ He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
__cs__ We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
__cs__ Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
__cs__ He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
__cs__ In the background , my bicycle .
__cs__ I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
__cs__ Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
__cs__ We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
__cs__ Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
__cs__ Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
__cs__ ( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
__cs__ Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
__cs__ Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
__cs__ It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
__cs__ I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
__cs__ So I think locally and I act locally .
__cs__ I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
__cs__ So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
__cs__ I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
__cs__ And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
__cs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
__cs__ Put your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
__cs__ Not just showing up every now and then .
__cs__ No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
__cs__ I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not claps .
__cs__ I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
__cs__ Not just show up to class every now and then .
__cs__ Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
__cs__ One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
__cs__ No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
__cs__ You won &apos;t need to know trig .
__cs__ But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
__cs__ None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
__cs__ We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
__cs__ ( High-pitched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
__cs__ My students in El Cerrito — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope — measured the speed of light .
__cs__ We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
__cs__ In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
__cs__ I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
__cs__ I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Aw man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
__cs__ And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
__cs__ And there &apos;s no time to do it .
__cs__ So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
__cs__ But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
__cs__ Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
__cs__ But , probably — one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
__cs__ And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
__cs__ is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
__cs__ Right ? This is simple physics .
__cs__ All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
__cs__ What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eighth-grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
__cs__ And that constant is the speed of sound .
__cs__ So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
__cs__ I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
__cs__ Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
__cs__ Now , so I know the frequency .
__cs__ It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
__cs__ All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
__cs__ So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
__cs__ I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
__cs__ The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
__cs__ Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
__cs__ From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
__cs__ So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
__cs__ I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
__cs__ 0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
__cs__ OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
__cs__ And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
__cs__ The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
__cs__ Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
__cs__ If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
__cs__ But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . Pretty good .
__cs__ All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
__cs__ Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
__cs__ It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
__cs__ I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
__cs__ There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
__cs__ There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
__cs__ I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
__cs__ Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
__cs__ And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
__cs__ I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
__cs__ This cop comes after me with a rifle .
__cs__ He wants to clunk me over the head !
__cs__ I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
__cs__ It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
__cs__ The cop &apos;s chasing me .
__cs__ Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
__cs__ Chases me into this room .
__cs__ The entranceway to the bell tower .
__cs__ I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
__cs__ And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
__cs__ I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
__cs__ There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
__cs__ The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
__cs__ I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
__cs__ I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
__cs__ I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
__cs__ A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
__cs__ I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
__cs__ And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
__cs__ Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
__cs__ So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
__cs__ I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
__cs__ In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
__cs__ It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
__cs__ A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
__cs__ I had just driven home , it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter , I had been visiting my friend , Jeff , across town , and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees — and don &apos;t bother asking if that &apos;s Celsius or Fahrenheit , minus 40 is where the two scales meet — it was very cold .
__cs__ And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
__cs__ In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them .
__cs__ So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
__cs__ I thought about calling a locksmith — at least I had my cellphone , but at midnight , it could take a while for a locksmith to show up , and it was cold .
__cs__ I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase .
__cs__ So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it .
__cs__ This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even .
__cs__ Now , I &apos;m a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress .
__cs__ It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate , it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking .
__cs__ So the next morning , when I woke up on too little sleep , worrying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contractor , and the freezing temperatures , and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cortisol in my brain , my thinking was cloudy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport check-in counter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my passport . ( Laughter )
__cs__ So I raced home in the snow and ice , 40 minutes , got my passport , raced back to the airport , I made it just in time , but they had given away my seat to someone else , so I got stuck in the back of the plane , next to the bathrooms , in a seat that wouldn &apos;t recline , on an eight-hour flight .
__cs__ Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
__cs__ Or at least if bad things happen , will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe .
__cs__ So I started thinking about that , but my thoughts didn &apos;t crystallize until about a month later .
__cs__ I was having dinner with my colleague , Danny Kahneman , the Nobel Prize winner , and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window , and , you know , forgotten my passport , and Danny shared with me that he &apos;d been practicing something called prospective hindsight .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-mortem .
__cs__ Now , you all know what the postmortem is .
__cs__ Whenever there &apos;s a disaster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
__cs__ Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage .
__cs__ So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem .
__cs__ Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
__cs__ I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
__cs__ Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
__cs__ Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
__cs__ There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
__cs__ The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged .
__cs__ It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
__cs__ And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels , and they could still find their nuts .
__cs__ They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
__cs__ But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
__cs__ So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
__cs__ So in the home , designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
__cs__ For your passport , a particular drawer .
__cs__ For your reading glasses , a particular table .
__cs__ If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
__cs__ What about travel ?
__cs__ Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
__cs__ If these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .
__cs__ Now these are some rather obvious things .
__cs__ Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
__cs__ Cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
__cs__ So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
__cs__ And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .
__cs__ And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
__cs__ And so I want to talk about that .
__cs__ And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
__cs__ But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , and social decision-making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts .
__cs__ So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
__cs__ Now , you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
__cs__ And so you &apos;re thinking having high cholesterol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doctor says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol , a statin . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve probably heard of statins , you know that they &apos;re among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today , you probably even know people who take them .
__cs__ And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! Give me the statin . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don &apos;t like talking about , and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less .
__cs__ It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
__cs__ Now , what is this , the NNT ?
__cs__ It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
__cs__ And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that ?
__cs__ The number should be one .
__cs__ My doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
__cs__ But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
__cs__ And it &apos;s not the doctor &apos;s fault , if it &apos;s anybody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s the fault of scientists like me .
__cs__ We haven &apos;t figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
__cs__ But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
__cs__ How many people have to take it before one person is helped ?
__cs__ 300 .
__cs__ This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband , independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
__cs__ I ran through the numbers myself .
__cs__ 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack , stroke or other adverse event is prevented .
__cs__ Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol .
__cs__ Why not , doc ? Give me the prescription anyway . &quot; &quot; But you should ask at this point for another statistic , and that is , &quot; &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__cs__ So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
__cs__ And they include terrible things — debilitating muscle and joint pain , gastrointestinal distress — but now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Five percent , not very likely it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;ll still take the drug . &quot; &quot; But wait a minute .
__cs__ Remember under stress you &apos;re not thinking clearly .
__cs__ So think about how you &apos;re going to work through this ahead of time , so you don &apos;t have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot .
__cs__ 300 people take the drug , right ? One person &apos;s helped , five percent of those 300 have side effects , that &apos;s 15 people .
__cs__ You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
__cs__ Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
__cs__ I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
__cs__ Medical ethics requires it , it &apos;s part of the principle of informed consent .
__cs__ You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not .
__cs__ Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pulled this number out of the air for shock value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .
__cs__ For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 .
__cs__ That &apos;s right , 49 surgeries are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
__cs__ And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
__cs__ They include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
__cs__ And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
__cs__ So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
__cs__ You don &apos;t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
__cs__ And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
__cs__ Because you have a choice oftentimes , do you I want a shorter life that &apos;s pain-free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end ?
__cs__ These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your loved ones .
__cs__ You might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you &apos;re practiced with this kind of thinking .
__cs__ Remember , our brain under stress releases cortisol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down .
__cs__ There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
__cs__ Face-to-face with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if you &apos;re body is expending metabolism on those things and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s lunch , and then none of those things matter .
__cs__ Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
__cs__ So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
__cs__ I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
__cs__ We all are going to fail now and then .
__cs__ The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
__cs__ Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I got back from my trip , I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .
__cs__ And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
__cs__ So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a gradual process , and I &apos;m getting there .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Are you awake ?
__cs__ They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
__cs__ Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
__cs__ Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , ordering food .
__cs__ So I looked at the waiter and said , &quot; Do you have a menu ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
__cs__ He looked at me strangely , thinking that he misheard .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pronunciation correct ?
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the waiter .
__cs__ He was disgusted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
__cs__ What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
__cs__ Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant .
__cs__ How could she speak that way ?
__cs__ At that moment , I started thinking .
__cs__ It made me mad .
__cs__ It definitely hurts !
__cs__ I &apos;m denied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
__cs__ Where could this happen ?
__cs__ How did we get here ?
__cs__ Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civilized .
__cs__ Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intellect and all my memories ?
__cs__ Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
__cs__ Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to conform ?
__cs__ To be one of them ?
__cs__ Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
__cs__ Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me .
__cs__ The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satisfy today &apos;s needs .
__cs__ It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
__cs__ If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
__cs__ Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
__cs__ So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
__cs__ This is one reality .
__cs__ But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
__cs__ Arabic is the mother tongue .
__cs__ Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue .
__cs__ Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages .
__cs__ How ?
__cs__ Gibran Khalil Gibran , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
__cs__ All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , smelling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
__cs__ So , when he started writing in English , he had enough baggage .
__cs__ Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
__cs__ You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Mount Lebanon .
__cs__ So , this is an example no one can argue with .
__cs__ Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
__cs__ This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
__cs__ The Germans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
__cs__ That &apos;s why they legislate to protect their language .
__cs__ They make it sacred .
__cs__ That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
__cs__ Do we know better than them ?
__cs__ All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
__cs__ Countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
__cs__ They kept it close to them .
__cs__ Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Turkish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
__cs__ You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
__cs__ They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
__cs__ So , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
__cs__ If I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this remind you of ?
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
__cs__ Regardless of the who , how and why .
__cs__ Language isn &apos;t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
__cs__ Language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
__cs__ So when we say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
__cs__ Language isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
__cs__ It &apos;s an idea inside that relates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
__cs__ What is our intellect ?
__cs__ How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
__cs__ So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
__cs__ How would you feel ?
__cs__ If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
__cs__ The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
__cs__ I have a francophone friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
__cs__ I asked her once how things were going .
__cs__ She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; toqborni &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mistakenly told him &quot; &quot; toqborni , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
__cs__ He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cruel ?
__cs__ Does she want to commit suicide ?
__cs__ &apos;Bury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
__cs__ It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
__cs__ She said to me , &quot; &quot; He listens to Fairuz with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and stole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pickle : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
__cs__ Translate that for me .
__cs__ ( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
__cs__ We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
__cs__ Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
__cs__ Forget about this headache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
__cs__ The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West . &quot;
__cs__ We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
__cs__ And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
__cs__ We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and day-to-day life .
__cs__ In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
__cs__ So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you reply from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
__cs__ Something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
__cs__ After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
__cs__ You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
__cs__ Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
__cs__ We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
__cs__ If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
__cs__ We &apos;d have to find an existence .
__cs__ We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
__cs__ This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
__cs__ After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
__cs__ Photos of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
__cs__ We are very cool !
__cs__ And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; Ha ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nicer and matches the reality better .
__cs__ I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laughs ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
__cs__ But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
__cs__ Creativity is the idea .
__cs__ So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
__cs__ At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
__cs__ Creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
__cs__ Let &apos;s start from this moment .
__cs__ Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
__cs__ A single novel could make us global again .
__cs__ It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
__cs__ So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
__cs__ But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
__cs__ In conclusion , what can you do today ?
__cs__ Now , tweets , who &apos;s tweeting ?
__cs__ Please , I beg of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
__cs__ But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
__cs__ ( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
__cs__ You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
__cs__ It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
__cs__ That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
__cs__ Second , there are many other things that we can do .
__cs__ We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
__cs__ We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language .
__cs__ Now I will tell you a secret .
__cs__ A baby first identifies its father through language .
__cs__ When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter Noor , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Dis , &apos; Merci , Maman , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe . ( Applause )
__cs__ Sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
__cs__ The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
__cs__ I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
__cs__ I want to know how I impact them .
__cs__ I want to know how they impact me .
__cs__ I want to know why they fish .
__cs__ I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
__cs__ Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
__cs__ It allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
__cs__ So what do we call this ?
__cs__ I think we call it restorative seafood .
__cs__ Where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain , restorative is the ability to replenish and progress .
__cs__ Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
__cs__ It is a more hopeful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
__cs__ Wallet guides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very handy ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
__cs__ Green , yellow and red lists &#91; of &#93; seafood species .
__cs__ The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
__cs__ But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
__cs__ We can &apos;t sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
__cs__ But what if we eat only in the green list ?
__cs__ You &apos;ve got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here — comes from sustainable stocks .
__cs__ Pole caught — no bycatch .
__cs__ Great for fishermen . Lots of money . Supporting local economies .
__cs__ But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
__cs__ What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
__cs__ Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this ?
__cs__ Do I do this three times a week ?
__cs__ I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favors .
__cs__ The point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
__cs__ Example : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — antioxidants and minerals — heart healthy .
__cs__ That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
__cs__ I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
__cs__ Well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
__cs__ Well folks , we have a protein problem .
__cs__ We have lost this sensibility when it regards our food , and we are paying a cost .
__cs__ The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
__cs__ We are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
__cs__ And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
__cs__ So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .
__cs__ Restorative seafood might best be represented not by Jaws , or by Flipper , or the Gordon &apos;s fisherman , but rather , by the Jolly Green Giant .
__cs__ Vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
__cs__ Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
__cs__ Well I &apos;d like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue .
__cs__ We must continue to eat the best seafood possible , if at all .
__cs__ But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .
__cs__ The best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half-shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges .
__cs__ It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
__cs__ Whooo !
__cs__ This is an easy sell .
__cs__ And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .
__cs__ Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat .
__cs__ Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
__cs__ There &apos;s a pattern here .
__cs__ Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
__cs__ We have ravaged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one .
__cs__ So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
__cs__ And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
__cs__ Sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
__cs__ So let &apos;s start there .
__cs__ There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
__cs__ Dan Barber and Alice Waters are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution .
__cs__ But green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters .
__cs__ Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate .
__cs__ We have eco-friendly shrimp .
__cs__ We can make them ; we have that technology .
__cs__ But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__cs__ Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood .
__cs__ While we try to manage declining marine populations , the media &apos;s recommending increased consumption of seafood .
__cs__ Studies say that tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood .
__cs__ That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
__cs__ But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
__cs__ It &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
__cs__ As a chef , I realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
__cs__ A couple things happened .
__cs__ I made more money .
__cs__ People started buying appetizers and salads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entrees alone .
__cs__ People spent more time engaging in their meals , engaging with each other over their meals .
__cs__ People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
__cs__ They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
__cs__ They got healthier . I made more money .
__cs__ This is great .
__cs__ Environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .
__cs__ One of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served — small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
__cs__ Shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char — these were the common species .
__cs__ We were directing tastes towards more resilience , more restorative options .
__cs__ This is what we need to favor .
__cs__ This is what the green list says .
__cs__ But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
__cs__ But what of those big predators , those fashionable species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
__cs__ Well , if you must , I have a recipe for you .
__cs__ It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
__cs__ Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish .
__cs__ Get a knife . Cut it into four portions .
__cs__ Put it on four plates .
__cs__ Mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
__cs__ Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this .
__cs__ Invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
__cs__ I expect a lot from food .
__cs__ I expect health and joy and family and community .
__cs__ I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests .
__cs__ I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
__cs__ And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
__cs__ I remember well the meals of my childhood .
__cs__ They were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch , usually rice .
__cs__ This is still how I largely eat today .
__cs__ I get sick when I go to steakhouses .
__cs__ I get the meat sweats .
__cs__ It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
__cs__ It &apos;s disgusting .
__cs__ But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
__cs__ Eat your vegetables .
__cs__ It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
__cs__ So what are we looking for in a meal ?
__cs__ Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body .
__cs__ For joy , I &apos;m looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance .
__cs__ For family , I &apos;m looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories .
__cs__ For community though , we start at the very beginning .
__cs__ There &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
__cs__ So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .
__cs__ We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
__cs__ But it is more than just a repository of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geography of the communion we call dinner .
__cs__ So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
__cs__ We need to savor vegetables .
__cs__ We need to savor smaller portions of seafood .
__cs__ And we need to save dinner .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
__cs__ If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
__cs__ In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
__cs__ So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
__cs__ Let me give you just one example of this .
__cs__ One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
__cs__ After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
__cs__ And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
__cs__ Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
__cs__ We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
__cs__ Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
__cs__ Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
__cs__ So how do we actually ask them the question ?
__cs__ Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
__cs__ What we did — Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
__cs__ Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
__cs__ And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
__cs__ So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
__cs__ But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
__cs__ I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
__cs__ I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
__cs__ We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
__cs__ And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
__cs__ So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
__cs__ And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
__cs__ On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
__cs__ But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
__cs__ So there are two really remarkable things about this .
__cs__ The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
__cs__ And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
__cs__ Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
__cs__ So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
__cs__ And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
__cs__ The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
__cs__ And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
__cs__ I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
__cs__ And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
__cs__ But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
__cs__ If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
__cs__ And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
__cs__ On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
__cs__ And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
__cs__ They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
__cs__ And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
__cs__ On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
__cs__ And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
__cs__ So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
__cs__ Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
__cs__ They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
__cs__ Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
__cs__ So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
__cs__ There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
__cs__ Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
__cs__ Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
__cs__ So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
__cs__ Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
__cs__ And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
__cs__ We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
__cs__ We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
__cs__ And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
__cs__ My son is 23 .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
__cs__ All right , why would we see this correlation ?
__cs__ Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
__cs__ And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
__cs__ So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
__cs__ You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
__cs__ And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
__cs__ So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
__cs__ We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
__cs__ And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
__cs__ So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
__cs__ So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
__cs__ We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
__cs__ Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
__cs__ If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
__cs__ And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
__cs__ But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
__cs__ And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
__cs__ And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
__cs__ And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
__cs__ So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
__cs__ They go out and test it against the evidence .
__cs__ The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
__cs__ Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
__cs__ And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
__cs__ And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
__cs__ And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
__cs__ So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
__cs__ This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
__cs__ So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
__cs__ All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
__cs__ Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
__cs__ How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
__cs__ So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
__cs__ This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
__cs__ And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
__cs__ Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
__cs__ If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
__cs__ But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
__cs__ Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
__cs__ Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
__cs__ So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
__cs__ It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
__cs__ So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
__cs__ And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
__cs__ Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
__cs__ The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
__cs__ They &apos;re just learning how to count .
__cs__ But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
__cs__ And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
__cs__ And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
__cs__ So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
__cs__ When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
__cs__ Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
__cs__ What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
__cs__ And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
__cs__ And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
__cs__ ( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
__cs__ Same as the other side .
__cs__ Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
__cs__ AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
__cs__ Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
__cs__ AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
__cs__ AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
__cs__ Boy : That &apos;s why .
__cs__ Oh .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) AG : Now this is his next idea .
__cs__ He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
__cs__ Not working either .
__cs__ Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
__cs__ Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
__cs__ AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
__cs__ Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
__cs__ So when you put four .
__cs__ So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
__cs__ AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
__cs__ Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
__cs__ If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
__cs__ This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
__cs__ Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
__cs__ What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
__cs__ Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
__cs__ And I think just the opposite is true .
__cs__ I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
__cs__ Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
__cs__ And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
__cs__ So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
__cs__ Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
__cs__ And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
__cs__ So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
__cs__ So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
__cs__ If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
__cs__ I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
__cs__ So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
__cs__ But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
__cs__ And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
__cs__ So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
__cs__ So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
__cs__ That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
__cs__ Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
__cs__ And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
__cs__ And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
__cs__ So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
__cs__ It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
__cs__ Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__cs__ I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
__cs__ It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
__cs__ We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
__cs__ And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
__cs__ But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner .
__cs__ And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign .
__cs__ In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 46664 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
__cs__ And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island .
__cs__ And that &apos;s me with Youssou N &apos;Dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
__cs__ The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
__cs__ You can see the bars of the window there .
__cs__ It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
__cs__ In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
__cs__ This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
__cs__ And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
__cs__ I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
__cs__ Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela .
__cs__ But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
__cs__ I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
__cs__ I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
__cs__ I met him at a 46664 event .
__cs__ He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .
__cs__ This is a tool — this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
__cs__ And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
__cs__ It &apos;s a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV-positive .
__cs__ They work in the field .
__cs__ They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
__cs__ They have education programs .
__cs__ They bring out the issues of stigma .
__cs__ It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
__cs__ And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
__cs__ A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
__cs__ So this is my SING Campaign .
__cs__ SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
__cs__ I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
__cs__ Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
__cs__ In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
__cs__ Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
__cs__ This is in the Scottish Parliament .
__cs__ I &apos;ve subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .
__cs__ And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
__cs__ And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Choir who I simply adore .
__cs__ And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
__cs__ I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe — he &apos;s the director of UNAIDS .
__cs__ And I &apos;m very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador .
__cs__ And in this way , I &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
__cs__ The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
__cs__ It &apos;s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
__cs__ This can happen .
__cs__ And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
__cs__ And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
__cs__ Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
__cs__ It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic .
__cs__ Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile .
__cs__ This is Avelile — she goes with me wherever I go .
__cs__ I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans .
__cs__ Avelile &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from AIDS-related illness .
__cs__ Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
__cs__ And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
__cs__ At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown AIDS and had pneumonia .
__cs__ We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
__cs__ The doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
__cs__ They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
__cs__ And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
__cs__ So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
__cs__ Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again .
__cs__ And I &apos;m getting — the hairs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
__cs__ They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
__cs__ This is the transformation that took place .
__cs__ Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
__cs__ ( Applause ) That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile .
__cs__ And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
__cs__ So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-Saharan Africa — could you please stand up .
__cs__ I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
__cs__ With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
__cs__ The rocket was huge .
__cs__ And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
__cs__ On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
__cs__ One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
__cs__ In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
__cs__ Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
__cs__ And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; &quot; Sputnik , &quot; &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
__cs__ It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
__cs__ For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
__cs__ A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
__cs__ But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
__cs__ All hell broke loose .
__cs__ Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America — historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
__cs__ It provoked the missile gap .
__cs__ It exploded an arms race .
__cs__ It began the space race .
__cs__ Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
__cs__ And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
__cs__ For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
__cs__ Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
__cs__ But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
__cs__ For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
__cs__ Support for engineering , math and science — education in general — boomed .
__cs__ And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
__cs__ My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
__cs__ But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Sputnik &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
__cs__ In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
__cs__ And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
__cs__ ( Applause ) .
__cs__ Thank you , Chris .
__cs__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__cs__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__cs__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__cs__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__cs__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__cs__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__cs__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__cs__ Let me show you what I mean .
__cs__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__cs__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__cs__ All right . Very significant mark .
__cs__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__cs__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__cs__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__cs__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__cs__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__cs__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__cs__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__cs__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__cs__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__cs__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__cs__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__cs__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__cs__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__cs__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__cs__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__cs__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__cs__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__cs__ Wake up .
__cs__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__cs__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__cs__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__cs__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__cs__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__cs__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__cs__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__cs__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__cs__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__cs__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__cs__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
__cs__ ( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
__cs__ The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
__cs__ MT : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
__cs__ Voice : I think you got your birthday wish.MT : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
__cs__ And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.Voice : Signed card detected .
__cs__ Digital MT : This is without a question the real thing .
__cs__ MT : Bye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
__cs__ So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
__cs__ Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
__cs__ That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
__cs__ 6.6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
__cs__ Most of these deaths are preventable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
__cs__ Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five , and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn &apos;t some smart , new technological innovations .
__cs__ It &apos;s one of the world &apos;s oldest inventions : a bar of soap .
__cs__ Washing hands with soap , a habit we all take for granted , can reduce diarrhea by half , can reduce respiratory infections by one third .
__cs__ Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu , trachoma , SARS , and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak , one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap .
__cs__ Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school .
__cs__ It stops babies from dying .
__cs__ Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
__cs__ It can save over 600,000 children every year .
__cs__ That &apos;s the equivalent of stopping 10 jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day .
__cs__ I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
__cs__ So now just take a minute .
__cs__ I think you need to get to know the person next to you .
__cs__ Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
__cs__ Please shake their hands .
__cs__ All right , get to know each other .
__cs__ They look really pretty .
__cs__ All right .
__cs__ So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
__cs__ Pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
__cs__ What is it ? Is there no soap ?
__cs__ Actually , soap is available .
__cs__ In 90 percent of households in India , 94 percent of households in Kenya , you will find soap .
__cs__ Even in countries where soap is the lowest , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
__cs__ So why is it ?
__cs__ Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
__cs__ Why is it that Mayank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
__cs__ Well , in Mayank &apos;s family , soap is used for bathing , soap is used for laundry , soap is used for washing dishes .
__cs__ His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a precious commodity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cupboard .
__cs__ They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
__cs__ On average , in Mayank &apos;s family , they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best , and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap .
__cs__ What &apos;s the result of that ?
__cs__ Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
__cs__ Think about where you learned to wash your hands .
__cs__ Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
__cs__ Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
__cs__ I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it &apos;s very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life .
__cs__ However , we all copy what everyone else does , and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior , and this is where the private sector comes in .
__cs__ Every second in Asia and Africa , 111 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
__cs__ Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene , diseases , from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand .
__cs__ Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products .
__cs__ It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Unilever , that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers .
__cs__ Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn .
__cs__ Think about it : Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
__cs__ And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
__cs__ Just for a minute , imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap .
__cs__ The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world .
__cs__ But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera .
__cs__ Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment .
__cs__ A hundred and eighteen years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading .
__cs__ I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
__cs__ Government is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera , or Ebola at the moment , but with competing priorities .
__cs__ The budget is not always there .
__cs__ And when you think about this , you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit , it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior .
__cs__ In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap .
__cs__ We have friends like USAID , the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap , London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , Plan , WaterAid , that all believe for a win-win-win partnership .
__cs__ Win for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
__cs__ Win for the private sector , because we build new generations of future handwashers .
__cs__ And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
__cs__ On October 15 , we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day .
__cs__ Schools , communities , our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector — yes , on that day even our competitors , we all join hands to celebrate the world &apos;s most important public health intervention .
__cs__ What &apos;s required , and again where the private sector can make a huge difference , is coming up with this big , creative thinking that drives advocacy .
__cs__ If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign , we &apos;ve created great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them .
__cs__ We &apos;ve had over 30 million views .
__cs__ Most of these discussions are still happening online .
__cs__ I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films .
__cs__ I come from Mali , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
__cs__ I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice .
__cs__ I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
__cs__ I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Nine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and promoting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : soap .
__cs__ We run today the world &apos;s largest handwashing program by any public health standards .
__cs__ We &apos;ve reached over 183 million people in 16 countries .
__cs__ My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
__cs__ Over the last four years , business has grown double digits , whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased .
__cs__ It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
__cs__ Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
__cs__ Last week , my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a newborn .
__cs__ I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
__cs__ This one is from Myanmar .
__cs__ She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
__cs__ Her son , Myo , is her second one .
__cs__ She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks , and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life , and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant , and that if soap is used before touching the babies , we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers .
__cs__ And that &apos;s what inspires me , inspires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equip her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nurturing her newborn .
__cs__ And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her soap .
__cs__ It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
__cs__ I hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like Myo reach their fifth birthday .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ These are simple objects : clocks , keys , combs , glasses .
__cs__ They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey .
__cs__ We are all familiar with these mundane , everyday objects .
__cs__ Usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
__cs__ And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
__cs__ During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early &apos; 90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
__cs__ Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities , when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army .
__cs__ The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
__cs__ Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial , political , religious or ethnic group .
__cs__ As much as genocide is about killing .
__cs__ It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
__cs__ Genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
__cs__ There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
__cs__ There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them .
__cs__ Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified .
__cs__ Once recovered , these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned , analyzed , catalogued and stored .
__cs__ Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI .
__cs__ These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
__cs__ Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically , but physical browsing is extremely difficult , an ineffective and painful process .
__cs__ I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse .
__cs__ As a storyteller , I like to give back to the community .
__cs__ I like to move beyond raising awareness .
__cs__ And in this case , someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened .
__cs__ Photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
__cs__ In all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ But that can &apos;t be right .
__cs__ I am for chocolate donuts .
__cs__ So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
__cs__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
__cs__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__cs__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__cs__ It &apos;s awful .
__cs__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
__cs__ Since we are still realizing these works , we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery , still .
__cs__ So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
__cs__ So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes .
__cs__ A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room , and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall .
__cs__ Within seconds , as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So this is the sketch of the two states .
__cs__ One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
__cs__ And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state .
__cs__ This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions .
__cs__ One is the altar tablets of the 15th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Malevich &apos;s abstract compositions .
__cs__ So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
__cs__ So a viewer enters the space , and they snap to attention .
__cs__ And after a while , if the viewer continues to remain in the space , the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again , until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement , when they will again snap to attention .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So here it appears as if it &apos;s the viewer that &apos;s sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels , but it could also be the other way around , that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant .
__cs__ So this brings me to a quieter , small work called Handheld .
__cs__ The viewer sees a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on the far end of the wall , but when you go closer , you see that it &apos;s a blank A4 , or a letter-sized piece of paper , that &apos;s held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood .
__cs__ The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly , as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time , and somehow are not managing to .
__cs__ So here I &apos;m going to show you two tandem clips .
__cs__ And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
__cs__ So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel .
__cs__ So here &apos;s a video .
__cs__ You have to imagine the other hand . It &apos;s not there yet .
__cs__ But to us , we &apos;re sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture , as if there &apos;s a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper .
__cs__ That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them .
__cs__ The next work is Decoy .
__cs__ This is a cardboard model , so the object is about as tall as I am .
__cs__ It has a rounded body , two arms , and a very tall , head-like antenna , and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
__cs__ So when a viewer passes by , it sort of tilts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer .
__cs__ So here is the first test scenario .
__cs__ You see the two movements integrated , and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation .
__cs__ But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy .
__cs__ It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines .
__cs__ Because we are always working from a very personal space , we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance , at least .
__cs__ The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
__cs__ In the shape of an amphitheater that &apos;s scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage .
__cs__ Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
__cs__ They &apos;re mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will .
__cs__ So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
__cs__ It could be a few claps or a strong applause , and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage , and again the audience will respond .
__cs__ It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .
__cs__ So to us , I think we &apos;re really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that &apos;s also got a sort of musical-like quality to it , an instrument .
__cs__ So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied , nuanced musical or sound patterns , but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response .
__cs__ So there &apos;s a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved .
__cs__ It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it .
__cs__ So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands .
__cs__ So here &apos;s a small visual animation , as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension .
__cs__ And here is a prototype .
__cs__ So we can &apos;t wait to be engulfed by 996 of them .
__cs__ Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Framerunners .
__cs__ It comes out of the idea of a window .
__cs__ This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections .
__cs__ So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
__cs__ This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures .
__cs__ They &apos;re also made up of three different sizes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
__cs__ Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks .
__cs__ So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .
__cs__ So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they &apos;re oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall .
__cs__ So to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
__cs__ These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a fortress , because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world .
__cs__ So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement .
__cs__ So it &apos;s really quite small .
__cs__ You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand .
__cs__ So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Now , when a normal student writes a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
__cs__ So , you know — ( Laughter ) you get started maybe a little slowly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some heavier days later on , everything gets done , things stay civil . ( Laughter )
__cs__ And I would want to do that like that .
__cs__ I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And that would happen every single paper .
__cs__ And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
__cs__ This is how the year would go .
__cs__ So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
__cs__ How hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
__cs__ No big deal , right ?
__cs__ But then , the funniest thing happened .
__cs__ Those first few months ?
__cs__ So we had an awesome new revised plan .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And then — ( Laughter ) But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
__cs__ And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
__cs__ I thought that was the end of everything .
__cs__ But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school .
__cs__ And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That did not happen . ( Laughter )
__cs__ It was a very , very bad thesis . ( Laughter )
__cs__ I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot; ( Laughter )
__cs__ No , no , it was very , very bad .
__cs__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__cs__ And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
__cs__ My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me , and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators , and why we are the way we are .
__cs__ Now , I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people .
__cs__ I actually brought them here to show you today .
__cs__ I know that if you &apos;re not a trained brain expert , it &apos;s not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
__cs__ So here &apos;s the brain of a non-procrastinator .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Now ...
__cs__ here &apos;s my brain .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) There is a difference .
__cs__ Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them , but the procrastinator &apos;s brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey .
__cs__ Now , what does this mean for the procrastinator ?
__cs__ Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
__cs__ After that , we &apos;re going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much , much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber &apos;s mom .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today .
__cs__ Sorry ! &quot; &quot; ( Sigh ) Now , what is going on here ?
__cs__ The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel .
__cs__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__cs__ If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And to the Monkey , humans are just another animal species .
__cs__ You have to keep well-slept , well-fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
__cs__ But , if you haven &apos;t noticed , now we &apos;re not in tribal times .
__cs__ We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , and the Monkey does not know what that is .
__cs__ Which is why we have another guy in our brain , the Rational Decision-Maker , who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do .
__cs__ We can visualize the future .
__cs__ We can see the big picture .
__cs__ And he wants to take all of that into account .
__cs__ And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
__cs__ Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you &apos;re having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time .
__cs__ That &apos;s why there &apos;s an overlap .
__cs__ Sometimes they agree .
__cs__ And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
__cs__ I call it the Dark Playground .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Now , the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well .
__cs__ It &apos;s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening .
__cs__ And the question is , in this situation , with the Monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Now , the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time , but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there &apos;s danger of public embarrassment , a career disaster or some other scary consequence .
__cs__ And importantly , he &apos;s the only thing the Monkey is terrified of .
__cs__ Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Now , of course , I said yes .
__cs__ It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in the middle of all this excitement , the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind .
__cs__ He was saying , &quot; &quot; Are we clear on what we just accepted ?
__cs__ Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
__cs__ As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
__cs__ And I opened up the website , and there was my face staring right back at me .
__cs__ And guess who woke up ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system &apos;s in mayhem . ( Laughter )
__cs__ And the Monkey — remember , he &apos;s terrified of the Panic Monster — boom , he &apos;s up the tree !
__cs__ And this entire situation , with the three characters — this is the procrastinator &apos;s system .
__cs__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__cs__ This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
__cs__ When I did , I was amazed by the response .
__cs__ Literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
__cs__ These are people who were nurses , bankers , painters , engineers and lots and lots of PhD students .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And they were all writing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;
__cs__ But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails .
__cs__ These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
__cs__ And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the procrastinator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?
__cs__ Why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
__cs__ Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of procrastination .
__cs__ But there &apos;s a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline .
__cs__ He has nothing to wake up for , so the effects of procrastination , they &apos;re not contained ; they just extend outward forever .
__cs__ And it &apos;s this long-term kind of procrastination that &apos;s much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier , short-term deadline-based kind .
__cs__ It &apos;s usually suffered quietly and privately .
__cs__ And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are emailing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
__cs__ It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cramming for some project .
__cs__ It &apos;s that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator , at times , in their own lives .
__cs__ So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany — that I don &apos;t think non-procrastinators exist .
__cs__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastinators .
__cs__ Now , I want to show you one last thing .
__cs__ I call this a Life Calendar .
__cs__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__cs__ That &apos;s not that many boxes , especially since we &apos;ve already used a bunch of those .
__cs__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__cs__ We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastinating on , because everyone is procrastinating on something in life .
__cs__ We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey .
__cs__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__cs__ And because there &apos;s not that many boxes on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today .
__cs__ Well , maybe not today , but ...
__cs__ ( Laughter ) You know .
__cs__ Sometime soon .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ There &apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
__cs__ On that day , a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of Afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
__cs__ The column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
__cs__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
__cs__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__cs__ It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck .
__cs__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__cs__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__cs__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__cs__ There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?
__cs__ You know , in the military , they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
__cs__ In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
__cs__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__cs__ So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
__cs__ And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
__cs__ That &apos;s why they &apos;re attracted to the military .
__cs__ These better people are attracted to this concept of service .
__cs__ But that &apos;s completely wrong .
__cs__ What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
__cs__ I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
__cs__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__cs__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__cs__ So trust and cooperation are really important here .
__cs__ The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
__cs__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__cs__ I can &apos;t simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
__cs__ It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
__cs__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__cs__ If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
__cs__ Nothing personal .
__cs__ Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
__cs__ And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
__cs__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__cs__ There are inherent benefits to this .
__cs__ It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
__cs__ If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , that means you won &apos;t watch for danger .
__cs__ Bad system of survival .
__cs__ The modern day is exactly the same thing .
__cs__ The world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
__cs__ It could be the ups and downs in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
__cs__ It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
__cs__ Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
__cs__ It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
__cs__ We have no control over these forces .
__cs__ These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
__cs__ The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
__cs__ When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong , remarkable things happen .
__cs__ I was flying on a trip , and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called , and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
__cs__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__cs__ So I said something .
__cs__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__cs__ Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
__cs__ She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
__cs__ she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
__cs__ The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
__cs__ It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
__cs__ You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weakens the organization .
__cs__ When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
__cs__ The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
__cs__ If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
__cs__ We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
__cs__ Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
__cs__ They want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipline when necessary , build their self-confidence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
__cs__ Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
__cs__ We would never do it .
__cs__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__cs__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__cs__ If you get a job at Next Jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
__cs__ In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
__cs__ It &apos;s the complete opposite .
__cs__ This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
__cs__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__cs__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__cs__ They have violated this deep-seated social contract .
__cs__ We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
__cs__ This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
__cs__ Would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to Gandhi ?
__cs__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
__cs__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__cs__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__cs__ the people to save the numbers .
__cs__ They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
__cs__ Bob Chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
__cs__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__cs__ They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed layoffs .
__cs__ And Bob refused .
__cs__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__cs__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__cs__ And so they came up with a furlough program .
__cs__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
__cs__ They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
__cs__ But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much .
__cs__ He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot , and morale went up .
__cs__ They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
__cs__ And quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
__cs__ Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
__cs__ People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
__cs__ Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
__cs__ I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
__cs__ They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
__cs__ And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
__cs__ This is what a leader is .
__cs__ I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
__cs__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__cs__ We call them leaders because they go first .
__cs__ We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
__cs__ We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
__cs__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__cs__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__cs__ And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__cs__ So I grew up in Limpopo , on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga , a little town called Motetema .
__cs__ Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
__cs__ The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
__cs__ So as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shocking statistics .
__cs__ Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
__cs__ Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
__cs__ Various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
__cs__ Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
__cs__ The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
__cs__ So after seeing these shocking statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to bathe , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my trusty little steed , my Nokia 6234 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
__cs__ and it looked like the KFC special spice , you know ?
__cs__ So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the formula ready .
__cs__ Now we need to get this thing into practice .
__cs__ Fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more bathing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented DryBath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .
__cs__ You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
__cs__ So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available .
__cs__ One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bulk .
__cs__ They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigarettes . They buy one cigarette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
__cs__ So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets .
__cs__ You just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
__cs__ And the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
__cs__ After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
__cs__ We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
__cs__ Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
__cs__ After seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
__cs__ DryBath is a rich man &apos;s convenience and a poor man &apos;s lifesaver .
__cs__ Having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of Limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , I came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
__cs__ What &apos;s stopping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
__cs__ And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
__cs__ I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to bathe . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause . )
__cs__ Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
__cs__ I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
__cs__ There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
__cs__ The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
__cs__ So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
__cs__ Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
__cs__ It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
__cs__ And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
__cs__ In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
__cs__ In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
__cs__ In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
__cs__ After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
__cs__ You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
__cs__ So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
__cs__ And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
__cs__ So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
__cs__ At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
__cs__ And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
__cs__ Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
__cs__ We call this value-based healthcare .
__cs__ On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
__cs__ This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
__cs__ On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
__cs__ When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
__cs__ You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
__cs__ The differences were dramatic .
__cs__ Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
__cs__ Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
__cs__ If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
__cs__ You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
__cs__ If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
__cs__ Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
__cs__ That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
__cs__ When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
__cs__ But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
__cs__ And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
__cs__ Nobody knows .
__cs__ So going the hospital is a lottery .
__cs__ Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
__cs__ In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
__cs__ To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
__cs__ They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
__cs__ They all argued that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
__cs__ So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
__cs__ And they finally agreed .
__cs__ And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
__cs__ Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
__cs__ They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
__cs__ Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
__cs__ Since then , they publish every year .
__cs__ Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
__cs__ And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
__cs__ For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
__cs__ Now I found this principle really exciting .
__cs__ So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
__cs__ Continuous improvement .
__cs__ Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
__cs__ That &apos;s exciting in itself .
__cs__ But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
__cs__ So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
__cs__ They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
__cs__ In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
__cs__ So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
__cs__ Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
__cs__ We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
__cs__ OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
__cs__ The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
__cs__ Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
__cs__ That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
__cs__ Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
__cs__ This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
__cs__ The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
__cs__ In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
__cs__ The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
__cs__ Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
__cs__ They were always best in class .
__cs__ We were always best in class .
__cs__ And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
__cs__ But most of them don &apos;t know .
__cs__ But physicians have another characteristic .
__cs__ They actually thrive from peer recognition .
__cs__ If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
__cs__ They will share the information on how to improve .
__cs__ So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
__cs__ Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
__cs__ This is happening in reality .
__cs__ We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
__cs__ Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
__cs__ You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
__cs__ It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
__cs__ We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
__cs__ They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
__cs__ The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
__cs__ That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
__cs__ Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
__cs__ In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
__cs__ Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
__cs__ Why is that ?
__cs__ Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
__cs__ They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
__cs__ This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
__cs__ The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
__cs__ Can we measure it better than we do ?
__cs__ We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
__cs__ And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
__cs__ There was an enormous energy in the room .
__cs__ There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
__cs__ At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
__cs__ He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__cs__ Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
__cs__ I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
__cs__ Thank you .

__cs__ I &apos;m really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most , what factors actually matter the most for startup success .
__cs__ I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
__cs__ If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup , you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible .
__cs__ You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
__cs__ But if the startup organization is so great , why do so many fail ?
__cs__ That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
__cs__ I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success .
__cs__ And I wanted to try to be systematic about it , avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years .
__cs__ I wanted to know this because I &apos;ve been starting businesses since I was 12 years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school , to high school , when I made solar energy devices , to college , when I made loudspeakers .
__cs__ And when I graduated from college , I started software companies .
__cs__ And 20 years ago , I started Idealab , and in the last 20 years , we started more than 100 companies , many successes , and many big failures .
__cs__ We learned a lot from those failures .
__cs__ So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure .
__cs__ So I looked at these five .
__cs__ First , the idea .
__cs__ I used to think that the idea was everything .
__cs__ I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the &quot; &quot; aha ! &quot; &quot; moment when you first come up with the idea .
__cs__ But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the execution , adaptability , that mattered even more than the idea .
__cs__ I never thought I &apos;d be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everybody has a plan , until they get punched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well .
__cs__ So much about a team &apos;s execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer .
__cs__ The customer is the true reality .
__cs__ And that &apos;s why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
__cs__ Then I started looking at the business model .
__cs__ Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
__cs__ That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
__cs__ Then I looked at the funding .
__cs__ Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding .
__cs__ Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
__cs__ And then of course , the timing .
__cs__ Is the idea way too early and the world &apos;s not ready for it ?
__cs__ Is it early , as in , you &apos;re in advance and you have to educate the world ?
__cs__ Is it just right ?
__cs__ Or is it too late , and there &apos;s already too many competitors ?
__cs__ So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies .
__cs__ And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies , and 100 non-Idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it .
__cs__ So first , on these Idealab companies , the top five companies — Citysearch , CarsDirect , GoTo , NetZero , Tickets.com — those all became billion-dollar successes .
__cs__ And the five companies on the bottom — Z.com , Insider Pages , MyLife , Desktop Factory , Peoplelink — we all had high hopes for , but didn &apos;t succeed .
__cs__ So I tried to rank across all of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions .
__cs__ And then for non-Idealab companies , I looked at wild successes , like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn .
__cs__ And some failures : Webvan , Kozmo , Pets.com Flooz and Friendster .
__cs__ The bottom companies had intense funding , they even had business models in some cases , but they didn &apos;t succeed .
__cs__ I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies , and the results really surprised me .
__cs__ The number one thing was timing .
__cs__ Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
__cs__ Team and execution came in second , and the idea , the differentiability of the idea , the uniqueness of the idea , that actually came in third .
__cs__ Now , this isn &apos;t absolutely definitive , it &apos;s not to say that the idea isn &apos;t important , but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn &apos;t the most important thing .
__cs__ Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed .
__cs__ The last two , business model and funding , made sense to me actually .
__cs__ I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you &apos;re creating .
__cs__ And funding , I think as well , if you &apos;re underfunded at first but you &apos;re gaining traction , especially in today &apos;s age , it &apos;s very , very easy to get intense funding .
__cs__ So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these .
__cs__ So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about .
__cs__ Well , that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought , &quot; No one &apos;s going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger . &quot;
__cs__ Of course , people proved that wrong .
__cs__ But one of the reasons it succeeded , aside from a good business model , a good idea , great execution , is the timing .
__cs__ That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money , and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger .
__cs__ Same thing with Uber .
__cs__ Uber came out , incredible company , incredible business model , great execution , too .
__cs__ But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system .
__cs__ Drivers were looking for extra money ; it was very , very important .
__cs__ Some of our early successes , Citysearch , came out when people needed web pages .
__cs__ GoTo.com , which we announced actually at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic .
__cs__ We thought the idea was so great , but actually , the timing was probably maybe more important .
__cs__ And then some of our failures .
__cs__ We started a company called Z.com , it was an online entertainment company .
__cs__ We were so excited about it — we raised enough money , we had a great business model , we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company .
__cs__ But broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000 .
__cs__ It was too hard to watch video content online , you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff , and the company eventually went out of business in 2003 .
__cs__ Just two years later , when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America , YouTube was perfectly timed .
__cs__ Great idea , but unbelievable timing .
__cs__ In fact , YouTube didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started .
__cs__ It wasn &apos;t even certain that that would work out .
__cs__ But that was beautifully , beautifully timed .
__cs__ So what I would say , in summary , is execution definitely matters a lot .
__cs__ The idea matters a lot .
__cs__ But timing might matter even more .
__cs__ And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them .
__cs__ And to be really , really honest about it , not be in denial about any results that you see , because if you have something you love , you want to push it forward , but you have to be very , very honest about that factor on timing .
__cs__ As I said earlier , I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place .
__cs__ I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio , and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn &apos;t have happened otherwise .
__cs__ Thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .

__cs__ I &apos;d done well at school . Expectations for me were high , and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
__cs__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__cs__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__cs__ I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
__cs__ &quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
__cs__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__cs__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__cs__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__cs__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__cs__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__cs__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__cs__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__cs__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__cs__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__cs__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__cs__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__cs__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__cs__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__cs__ You see that glass of water ?
__cs__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__cs__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__cs__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__cs__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__cs__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__cs__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__cs__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__cs__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__cs__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__cs__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__cs__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__cs__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__cs__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__cs__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__cs__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__cs__ I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Intervoice , the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
__cs__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__cs__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__cs__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__cs__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__cs__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__cs__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__cs__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__cs__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__cs__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__cs__ The light never goes out .
__cs__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__cs__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m here to share my photography .
__cs__ Or is it photography ?
__cs__ Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
__cs__ Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
__cs__ It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
__cs__ And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
__cs__ So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
__cs__ I felt like anyone could do that .
__cs__ So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
__cs__ Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
__cs__ But it has an unexpected twist .
__cs__ And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
__cs__ Or photos like these — both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
__cs__ When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
__cs__ Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
__cs__ Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
__cs__ So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
__cs__ But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
__cs__ Is it something about the details or the colors ?
__cs__ Is it something about the light ?
__cs__ What creates the illusion ?
__cs__ Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
__cs__ But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
__cs__ It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
__cs__ So I think the basics are quite simple .
__cs__ I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
__cs__ And let me show you a simple example .
__cs__ Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
__cs__ But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
__cs__ But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
__cs__ So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
__cs__ And I see the same process with combining photographs .
__cs__ It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
__cs__ So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
__cs__ But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
__cs__ So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
__cs__ As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
__cs__ But combined , they can create something like this .
__cs__ So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
__cs__ Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
__cs__ And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
__cs__ The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
__cs__ Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
__cs__ So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
__cs__ So here &apos;s another example .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
__cs__ But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
__cs__ I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
__cs__ But it does require a lot of planning .
__cs__ And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
__cs__ So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
__cs__ The shores are from a different location .
__cs__ The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
__cs__ And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
__cs__ So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
__cs__ It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
__cs__ Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
__cs__ And here every piece is very well planned .
__cs__ And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
__cs__ So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Now , this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions .
__cs__ The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned .
__cs__ It seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
__cs__ Why should we care about this ?
__cs__ And that affects all of us .
__cs__ Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
__cs__ I like to think of it a bit like a Russian doll .
__cs__ Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
__cs__ It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients .
__cs__ I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
__cs__ It has allowed scammers to rip off vulnerable investors .
__cs__ This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
__cs__ Now , at Global Witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
__cs__ How does this actually work ?
__cs__ Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet .
__cs__ But as a natural optimist , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
__cs__ One of the things that is sad is that , actually , the US is lagging behind .
__cs__ So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
__cs__ For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
__cs__ We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
__cs__ We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Secrecy like this is not good for business . &quot;
__cs__ We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
__cs__ Together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
__cs__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__cs__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__cs__ Can that possibly be true ?
__cs__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__cs__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__cs__ CA : How does it work ?
__cs__ How do people release the documents ?
__cs__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__cs__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__cs__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__cs__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__cs__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__cs__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__cs__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__cs__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__cs__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__cs__ If we can have this document up ...
__cs__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__cs__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__cs__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__cs__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__cs__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__cs__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__cs__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__cs__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__cs__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__cs__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__cs__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__cs__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__cs__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__cs__ And so it came in from the outside .
__cs__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__cs__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__cs__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__cs__ JA : Yep .
__cs__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__cs__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__cs__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__cs__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__cs__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__cs__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__cs__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__cs__ Light &apos; em all up .
__cs__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__cs__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__cs__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__cs__ we need to move , time now !
__cs__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__cs__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__cs__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__cs__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__cs__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__cs__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__cs__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__cs__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__cs__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__cs__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__cs__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__cs__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__cs__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__cs__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__cs__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__cs__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__cs__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__cs__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__cs__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__cs__ I mean , did he ?
__cs__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__cs__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__cs__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__cs__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__cs__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__cs__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__cs__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__cs__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__cs__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__cs__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__cs__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__cs__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__cs__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__cs__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__cs__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__cs__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__cs__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__cs__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__cs__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__cs__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__cs__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__cs__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__cs__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__cs__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__cs__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__cs__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__cs__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__cs__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__cs__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__cs__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__cs__ Light is good .
__cs__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__cs__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__cs__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__cs__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__cs__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__cs__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__cs__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__cs__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__cs__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__cs__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__cs__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__cs__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__cs__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__cs__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__cs__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__cs__ What is this ?
__cs__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__cs__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__cs__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__cs__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__cs__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__cs__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__cs__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__cs__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__cs__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__cs__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__cs__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__cs__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__cs__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__cs__ Yeah .
__cs__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__cs__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__cs__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__cs__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__cs__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__cs__ That &apos;s a problem .
__cs__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__cs__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__cs__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__cs__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__cs__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__cs__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__cs__ Can that be right ?
__cs__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__cs__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__cs__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__cs__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__cs__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__cs__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__cs__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__cs__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__cs__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__cs__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__cs__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__cs__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__cs__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__cs__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__cs__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__cs__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__cs__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__cs__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__cs__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__cs__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__cs__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__cs__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__cs__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__cs__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__cs__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__cs__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__cs__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__cs__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__cs__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__cs__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__cs__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__cs__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__cs__ CA : Wow .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__cs__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__cs__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__cs__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__cs__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__cs__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__cs__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__cs__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__cs__ &quot; What I Will &quot; I will not dance to your war drum .
__cs__ I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
__cs__ I will not dance to that beating .
__cs__ I know that beat .
__cs__ It is lifeless .
__cs__ I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
__cs__ It was alive once , hunted , stolen , stretched .
__cs__ I will not dance to your drummed-up war .
__cs__ I will not pop , spin , break for you .
__cs__ I will not hate for you or even hate you .
__cs__ I will not kill for you .
__cs__ Especially I will not die for you .
__cs__ I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
__cs__ I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing .
__cs__ Everyone can be wrong .
__cs__ Life is a right , not collateral or casual .
__cs__ I will not forget where I come from .
__cs__ I will craft my own drum .
__cs__ Gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing .
__cs__ Our humming will be drumming .
__cs__ I will not be played .
__cs__ I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
__cs__ I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance .
__cs__ This heartbeat is louder than death .
__cs__ Your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . Haaa .
__cs__ What &apos;s up TED people ? Let me hear you make some noise .
__cs__ ( Applause ) A bunch of pacifists .
__cs__ Confused , aspiring pacifists .
__cs__ I understand .
__cs__ I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
__cs__ Like a lot .
__cs__ So I couldn &apos;t figure out what to read today .
__cs__ I mean , I &apos;ve been saying I &apos;ve been prepping .
__cs__ What that means is prepping my outfit , ( Laughter ) prepping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
__cs__ Poetry does that .
__cs__ It preps you . It aims you .
__cs__ So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
__cs__ But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
__cs__ Hold her now with you .
__cs__ You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
__cs__ Are you holding her ?
__cs__ This is &quot; &quot; Break Clustered . &quot; &quot; All holy history banned .
__cs__ Unwritten books predicted the future , projected the past .
__cs__ But my head unwraps around what appears limitless , man &apos;s creative violence .
__cs__ Whose son shall it be ?
__cs__ Which male child will perish a new day ?
__cs__ Our boys &apos; deaths galvanize .
__cs__ We cherish corpses .
__cs__ We mourn women , complicated .
__cs__ Bitches get beat daily .
__cs__ Profits made , prophets ignored .
__cs__ War and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods .
__cs__ All colors run , none of us solid .
__cs__ Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
__cs__ I live cycles of light and darkness .
__cs__ Rhythm is half silence .
__cs__ I see now , I never was one and not the other .
__cs__ Sickness , health , tender violence .
__cs__ I think now I never was pure .
__cs__ Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant — still am .
__cs__ Human contracted itself blind , malignant .
__cs__ I never was pure .
__cs__ Girl spoiled before ripened .
__cs__ Language can &apos;t math me .
__cs__ I experience exponentially .
__cs__ Everything is everything .
__cs__ One woman loses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
__cs__ One woman loses six .
__cs__ One woman loses her head .
__cs__ One woman searches rubble . One woman feeds on trash .
__cs__ One woman shoots her face . One woman shoots her husband .
__cs__ One woman straps herself .
__cs__ One woman gives birth to a baby .
__cs__ One woman gives birth to borders .
__cs__ One woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
__cs__ One woman never did .
__cs__ Where do refugee hearts go ?
__cs__ Broken , dissed , placed where they &apos;re not from , don &apos;t want to be missed .
__cs__ Faced with absence .
__cs__ We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all .
__cs__ My spine curves spiral .
__cs__ Precipice running to and running from human beings .
__cs__ Cluster bombs left behind .
__cs__ De facto landmines .
__cs__ A smoldering grief .
__cs__ Harvest contaminated tobacco .
__cs__ Harvest bombs .
__cs__ Harvest baby teeth .
__cs__ Harvest palms , smoke .
__cs__ Harvest witness , smoke .
__cs__ Resolutions , smoke .
__cs__ Salvation , smoke .
__cs__ Redemption , smoke .
__cs__ Breathe .
__cs__ Do not fear what has blown up .
__cs__ If you must , fear the unexploded .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
__cs__ The population explosion was unstoppable .
__cs__ Global famine was inevitable .
__cs__ A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
__cs__ The acid rain was falling on the forests .
__cs__ The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
__cs__ The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
__cs__ None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
__cs__ Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
__cs__ Child mortality is down by two-thirds .
__cs__ Per-capita food production is up by a third .
__cs__ And all this at a time when the population has doubled .
__cs__ How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
__cs__ How did we achieve that ?
__cs__ How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
__cs__ The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
__cs__ I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
__cs__ In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
__cs__ I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
__cs__ These are both real objects .
__cs__ One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus .
__cs__ The other is obviously a computer mouse .
__cs__ They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
__cs__ I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
__cs__ And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
__cs__ They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
__cs__ It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
__cs__ The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
__cs__ Homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
__cs__ Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
__cs__ There was no progress , no innovation .
__cs__ It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
__cs__ Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
__cs__ And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
__cs__ The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
__cs__ And more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
__cs__ They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
__cs__ And it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
__cs__ My body &apos;s an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
__cs__ They &apos;ve come together .
__cs__ How does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
__cs__ Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
__cs__ In an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
__cs__ One goes extinct for the other to survive .
__cs__ But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
__cs__ So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
__cs__ It &apos;s not confined to its own lineage .
__cs__ What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
__cs__ And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
__cs__ It &apos;s a unique human feature .
__cs__ No other animal does it .
__cs__ You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
__cs__ As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
__cs__ You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
__cs__ Chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
__cs__ They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
__cs__ In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
__cs__ But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
__cs__ Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
__cs__ There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
__cs__ And why does exchange raise living standards ?
__cs__ Well , the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817 .
__cs__ And here is a Stone Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
__cs__ Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
__cs__ Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
__cs__ So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .
__cs__ He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
__cs__ He can make his own spears and axes .
__cs__ Well no , because if you think about it , if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
__cs__ And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears .
__cs__ So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
__cs__ And this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
__cs__ Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time .
__cs__ That is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
__cs__ Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
__cs__ If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the countryside .
__cs__ You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
__cs__ You render it down . You make a candle , etc. etc .
__cs__ How long is it going to take you ? Quite a long time .
__cs__ How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average wage in Britain today ?
__cs__ And the answer is about half a second .
__cs__ Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
__cs__ And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
__cs__ And back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
__cs__ Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
__cs__ In other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
__cs__ Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
__cs__ It was self-sufficiency .
__cs__ We call that poverty these days .
__cs__ But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
__cs__ How many other people ?
__cs__ Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
__cs__ You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
__cs__ Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
__cs__ They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
__cs__ And that &apos;s the way society works .
__cs__ That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
__cs__ In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
__cs__ That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
__cs__ Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him .
__cs__ They made his silly outfits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
__cs__ He had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
__cs__ But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV &apos;s pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
__cs__ They &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had .
__cs__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
__cs__ We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
__cs__ Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
__cs__ Ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
__cs__ But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
__cs__ There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
__cs__ And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a reproductive division of labor .
__cs__ That is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
__cs__ The queen does it all .
__cs__ In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
__cs__ It &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
__cs__ ( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
__cs__ And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
__cs__ Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
__cs__ But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
__cs__ It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
__cs__ In all hunter-gatherer societies today , there &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
__cs__ It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
__cs__ And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
__cs__ The woman knows that , in the Hadzas &apos; case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
__cs__ And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
__cs__ And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
__cs__ All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it &apos;s big enough to share some .
__cs__ And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
__cs__ When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neanderthals didn &apos;t do this .
__cs__ They were a highly cooperative species .
__cs__ They were a highly intelligent species .
__cs__ Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
__cs__ They were imaginative . They buried their dead .
__cs__ They had language , probably , because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
__cs__ And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
__cs__ They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dissing the Neanderthals .
__cs__ But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
__cs__ There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
__cs__ It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
__cs__ And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
__cs__ For example , in the Caucasus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neanderthal tools .
__cs__ They &apos;re always made from local chert .
__cs__ In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
__cs__ And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
__cs__ Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
__cs__ People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
__cs__ Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
__cs__ And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
__cs__ You also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria .
__cs__ And that &apos;s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
__cs__ And that will have led to specialization .
__cs__ How do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
__cs__ Well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa , which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe .
__cs__ They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia .
__cs__ So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
__cs__ What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
__cs__ And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
__cs__ An example is Tasmania .
__cs__ When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
__cs__ They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
__cs__ It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
__cs__ How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
__cs__ It didn &apos;t happen in Tierra del Fuego — similar island , similar people .
__cs__ The reason : because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
__cs__ The Tasmanians were isolated .
__cs__ Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
__cs__ In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
__cs__ But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
__cs__ Nobody , literally nobody .
__cs__ There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
__cs__ I mean this quite seriously .
__cs__ The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
__cs__ He just knows how to run a company .
__cs__ The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
__cs__ We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
__cs__ I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Pencil &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
__cs__ And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
__cs__ It &apos;s not the same with language .
__cs__ With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
__cs__ But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
__cs__ We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
__cs__ And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.Q. , about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups .
__cs__ It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
__cs__ What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
__cs__ So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
__cs__ We &apos;re just the nodes in the network .
__cs__ We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
__cs__ It &apos;s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
__cs__ However , bad things happen .
__cs__ And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
__cs__ There will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
__cs__ Awful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
__cs__ But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
__cs__ Because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ My name is Amit .
__cs__ And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
__cs__ And it took 18 months .
__cs__ A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
__cs__ But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
__cs__ There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
__cs__ I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
__cs__ And I grew up in India .
__cs__ I had a great education — I &apos;m not complaining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
__cs__ And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
__cs__ And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
__cs__ So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
__cs__ So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
__cs__ You look around at all these museums here .
__cs__ You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
__cs__ Two ways of going in — very simple .
__cs__ Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
__cs__ You move around , you have fun .
__cs__ You want to navigate around the museum ?
__cs__ Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
__cs__ You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
__cs__ Keep going . Have fun .
__cs__ Explore .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harvesters &quot; &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
__cs__ I see this plus sign .
__cs__ If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
__cs__ Now this is one of the images .
__cs__ So this is all of the meta-data information .
__cs__ For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
__cs__ And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
__cs__ So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
__cs__ And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
__cs__ So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
__cs__ You can zoom around very simply .
__cs__ You see some fun stuff happening here .
__cs__ I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
__cs__ But then you really want to go deep .
__cs__ And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
__cs__ And I was like , &quot; &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
__cs__ I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
__cs__ And apparently it was quite popular .
__cs__ I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
__cs__ Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
__cs__ Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
__cs__ Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
__cs__ ( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
__cs__ So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
__cs__ So another one of my favorites , &quot; &quot; The Starry Night . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
__cs__ But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
__cs__ And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
__cs__ You zoom in . You really go in .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
__cs__ This is &quot; &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
__cs__ There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
__cs__ This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
__cs__ Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
__cs__ You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
__cs__ Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom — you can just zoom around .
__cs__ This is &quot; &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; &quot; based in the National Gallery .
__cs__ You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
__cs__ So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
__cs__ I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
__cs__ It really comes from these artists .
__cs__ And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
__cs__ I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
__cs__ And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
__cs__ It &apos;s to supplement the experience .
__cs__ And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m a storyteller .
__cs__ That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing novels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
__cs__ But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story .
__cs__ I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
__cs__ I was born in Strasbourg , France to Turkish parents .
__cs__ Shortly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
__cs__ From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
__cs__ Now in the early 1970s , in Ankara , that was a bit unusual .
__cs__ Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment .
__cs__ In fact , I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood .
__cs__ On the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , Turkish woman .
__cs__ On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
__cs__ This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
__cs__ Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
__cs__ Each time , my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
__cs__ Then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink .
__cs__ A week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination .
__cs__ Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
__cs__ I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of praying ?
__cs__ In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls .
__cs__ It will dry up inside .
__cs__ Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
__cs__ We all do .
__cs__ We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
__cs__ But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside .
__cs__ Our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .
__cs__ Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
__cs__ Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
__cs__ It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
__cs__ Ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
__cs__ And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , East and West alike .
__cs__ We tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .
__cs__ In my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
__cs__ Stories cannot demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls .
__cs__ And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
__cs__ I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
__cs__ My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
__cs__ In retrospect , I think she was slightly worried about my sanity .
__cs__ I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
__cs__ I was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
__cs__ What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
__cs__ Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
__cs__ And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
__cs__ So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
__cs__ And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
__cs__ Now one other thing happened around this same time .
__cs__ My mother became a diplomat .
__cs__ So from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in Madrid &#93; , where I was the only Turk .
__cs__ It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; representative foreigner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy .
__cs__ Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger .
__cs__ We were like a miniature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place .
__cs__ The child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
__cs__ And I should know , because during the time I attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Eurovision Song Contest .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
__cs__ I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there .
__cs__ The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Midnight Express , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked , because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
__cs__ I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
__cs__ After Spain , we went to Jordan , Germany and Ankara again .
__cs__ Everywhere I went , I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me .
__cs__ Stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked .
__cs__ In my mid-twenties , I moved to Istanbul , the city I adore .
__cs__ I lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .
__cs__ I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
__cs__ When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
__cs__ There was the local grocer there — a grumpy , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to marginals .
__cs__ He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks .
__cs__ I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .
__cs__ In the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
__cs__ But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
__cs__ I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against .
__cs__ Shortly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
__cs__ I experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
__cs__ I started writing fiction in English .
__cs__ I &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile — they ask me why I do this — but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
__cs__ I love writing in Turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
__cs__ So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
__cs__ For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
__cs__ When you &apos;re a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration .
__cs__ As latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
__cs__ And that gap is very intimidating .
__cs__ But if we manage not to be frightened by it , it &apos;s also stimulating .
__cs__ And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimulating .
__cs__ At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all .
__cs__ And because God loves her , I did get married .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But instead of settling down , I went to Arizona .
__cs__ And since my husband is in Istanbul , I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
__cs__ I guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually .
__cs__ Stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue .
__cs__ Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
__cs__ And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
__cs__ When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
__cs__ &quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hispanic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Turkish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters , but I understood what my critic was looking for .
__cs__ And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him .
__cs__ He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
__cs__ He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
__cs__ We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
__cs__ Many authors feel this pressure , but non-Western authors feel it more heavily .
__cs__ If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
__cs__ You &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your Western colleagues .
__cs__ What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .
__cs__ Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the representatives of their respective cultures : a few authors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
__cs__ We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
__cs__ The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality .
__cs__ When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , Baldwin stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
__cs__ There &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together .
__cs__ I never forget my first multicultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
__cs__ We were three writers , one from the Philippines , one Turkish and one Indonesian — like a joke , you know .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .
__cs__ It was only because of our passports .
__cs__ Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary .
__cs__ A function is attributed to fiction .
__cs__ In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
__cs__ But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West .
__cs__ It comes from everywhere .
__cs__ And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel .
__cs__ I had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women .
__cs__ My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted .
__cs__ Some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict .
__cs__ But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
__cs__ It was just a story .
__cs__ And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to belittle my work .
__cs__ I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
__cs__ Writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
__cs__ Chekhov said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
__cs__ And only the latter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; Identity politics divides us . Fiction connects .
__cs__ One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
__cs__ The other , in nuances .
__cs__ One draws boundaries .
__cs__ The other recognizes no frontiers .
__cs__ Identity politics is made of solid bricks .
__cs__ Fiction is flowing water .
__cs__ In the Ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called &quot; &quot; meddah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising .
__cs__ With each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character .
__cs__ Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , Muslims and non-Muslims .
__cs__ Stories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Balkans and Asia .
__cs__ Today , stories continue to transcend borders .
__cs__ When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator .
__cs__ Literature has to take us beyond .
__cs__ If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
__cs__ Books have saved the introverted , timid child that I was — that I once was .
__cs__ But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fetishizing them .
__cs__ When the poet and mystic , Rumi , met his spiritual companion , Shams of Tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
__cs__ The Sufis say , &quot; &quot; Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected .
__cs__ There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compass .
__cs__ As you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
__cs__ Meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving .
__cs__ Like that , my fiction as well .
__cs__ One part of it is rooted in Istanbul , with strong Turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures .
__cs__ In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
__cs__ Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace , which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than 400 years .
__cs__ In the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there &apos;s an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn .
__cs__ It &apos;s between buildings .
__cs__ I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
__cs__ We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
__cs__ We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .
__cs__ But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most .
__cs__ When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability .
__cs__ I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
__cs__ I like it when my characters surprise me .
__cs__ I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a handsome , gay professor in Norway .
__cs__ As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
__cs__ Audre Lorde once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
__cs__ And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
__cs__ Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
__cs__ Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
__cs__ We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
__cs__ We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next .
__cs__ In the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles .
__cs__ They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
__cs__ And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
__cs__ We do achieve more in game worlds .
__cs__ So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
__cs__ Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
__cs__ We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
__cs__ And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
__cs__ Five million people use it every month .
__cs__ That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
__cs__ His work is brilliant .
__cs__ But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
__cs__ We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
__cs__ Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
__cs__ People were suffering . People were fighting .
__cs__ This is really exciting .
__cs__ According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
__cs__ We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
__cs__ We made this game in 2007 .
__cs__ This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
__cs__ We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
__cs__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__cs__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
__cs__ of sleep-deprived women .
__cs__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__cs__ Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
__cs__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__cs__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__cs__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__cs__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__cs__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
__cs__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__cs__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__cs__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__cs__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__cs__ So a high I.Q.
__cs__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__cs__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__cs__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__cs__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__cs__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__cs__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ This story is about taking imagination seriously .
__cs__ Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
__cs__ Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
__cs__ I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
__cs__ I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
__cs__ In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
__cs__ I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India .
__cs__ Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram .
__cs__ The deadline for the show arrived — my paints didn &apos;t .
__cs__ I had to do something .
__cs__ This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
__cs__ So I tried bronze casting .
__cs__ But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
__cs__ I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
__cs__ I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
__cs__ My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
__cs__ It &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; &quot; Wide Hips . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We hoisted them on poles to photograph .
__cs__ I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
__cs__ I was mesmerized .
__cs__ I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers .
__cs__ I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
__cs__ Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in Madrid .
__cs__ Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola-Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal .
__cs__ He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preserve my art .
__cs__ Durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
__cs__ For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
__cs__ We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
__cs__ So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
__cs__ We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
__cs__ But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
__cs__ I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America &apos;s Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel .
__cs__ He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
__cs__ I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
__cs__ So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
__cs__ There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
__cs__ So we had to create one .
__cs__ Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
__cs__ It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
__cs__ ( Applause ) This intersection had been bland and anonymous .
__cs__ Now it had a sense of place .
__cs__ I walked underneath it for the first time .
__cs__ As I watched the wind &apos;s choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
__cs__ My life was not going to be the same .
__cs__ I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
__cs__ Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
__cs__ So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
__cs__ I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
__cs__ Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
__cs__ I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .
__cs__ It shifted the Earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
__cs__ So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
__cs__ Its title : &quot; &quot; 1.26 &quot; &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shortened .
__cs__ I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
__cs__ Its shape was too complex now .
__cs__ So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
__cs__ The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
__cs__ There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
__cs__ So we had to create it .
__cs__ Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line .
__cs__ This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
__cs__ They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
__cs__ Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
__cs__ Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
__cs__ My artistic horizons continue to grow .
__cs__ I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
__cs__ I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
__cs__ An attorney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
__cs__ There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
__cs__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__cs__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__cs__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__cs__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__cs__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__cs__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__cs__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__cs__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__cs__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__cs__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__cs__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__cs__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__cs__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__cs__ And I felt lighter in my body .
