__cs__ When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
__cs__ My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
__cs__ There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shouted .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
__cs__ A morning that I will never forget .
__cs__ A real school .
__cs__ You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
__cs__ So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
__cs__ It was the only way we both could be educated .
__cs__ Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
__cs__ We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
__cs__ The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
__cs__ It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
__cs__ We all knew we were risking our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
__cs__ From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
__cs__ We always wondered what they knew about us .
__cs__ Were we being followed ?
__cs__ Do they know where we live ?
__cs__ We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
__cs__ I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
__cs__ My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
__cs__ A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
__cs__ But my educated mother became a teacher .
__cs__ There she is .
__cs__ She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
__cs__ And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
__cs__ There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
__cs__ To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
__cs__ During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
__cs__ I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
__cs__ Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
__cs__ But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
__cs__ So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
__cs__ I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
__cs__ Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
__cs__ Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
__cs__ ( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
__cs__ He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
__cs__ ( Applause ) My family believes in me .
__cs__ I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
__cs__ That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
__cs__ That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
__cs__ The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
__cs__ And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
__cs__ Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
__cs__ Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
__cs__ As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
__cs__ It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
__cs__ In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
__cs__ Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
__cs__ But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
__cs__ I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
__cs__ I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
__cs__ But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
__cs__ To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
__cs__ Like me , they are dreaming big .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ And you &apos;ll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
__cs__ And slightly more complex things appear .
__cs__ That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
__cs__ And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
__cs__ But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
__cs__ Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
__cs__ Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
__cs__ We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
__cs__ What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
__cs__ How old are you ? What do you do ?
__cs__ Then we get more personal with it .
__cs__ Have you ever had any diseases ?
__cs__ Have you ever been divorced ?
__cs__ Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
__cs__ What are you into ? Who are you into ?
__cs__ What gender do you like to sleep with ?
__cs__ I get it .
__cs__ We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
__cs__ We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
__cs__ We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
__cs__ We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
__cs__ Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
__cs__ Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
__cs__ The boxes are too narrow .
__cs__ And this can get really dangerous .
__cs__ So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
__cs__ I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
__cs__ I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
__cs__ I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
__cs__ Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
__cs__ So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
__cs__ I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
__cs__ They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
__cs__ So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
__cs__ When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
__cs__ I kept up the charade for eight years .
__cs__ So this is me when I was 11 .
__cs__ I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Julian Po . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
__cs__ See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
__cs__ In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
__cs__ Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
__cs__ When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
__cs__ At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
__cs__ It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
__cs__ I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
__cs__ I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
__cs__ If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
__cs__ But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
__cs__ Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
__cs__ When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
__cs__ No one is exactly shocked .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
__cs__ When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
__cs__ Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
__cs__ See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
__cs__ I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
__cs__ So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
__cs__ And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
__cs__ But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
__cs__ And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
__cs__ And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
__cs__ If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
__cs__ At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
__cs__ I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines — girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
__cs__ I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
__cs__ And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
__cs__ I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
__cs__ I was not an activist .
__cs__ I wave no flags in my own life .
__cs__ But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
__cs__ How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
__cs__ Were we even a group ? What group ?
__cs__ And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
__cs__ Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
__cs__ And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
__cs__ It might give them pause .
__cs__ Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
__cs__ Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
__cs__ For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
__cs__ Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
__cs__ So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
__cs__ And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
__cs__ So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
__cs__ And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
__cs__ And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
__cs__ And then we made this .
__cs__ ( Music ) Video : I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
__cs__ Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
__cs__ My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
__cs__ My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
__cs__ ( Music ) &quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
__cs__ It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
__cs__ We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
__cs__ There is no equality in the United States .
__cs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Marriage &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Freedom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
__cs__ The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
__cs__ Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
__cs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
__cs__ So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
__cs__ And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
__cs__ I want to take the project across the country .
__cs__ I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
__cs__ This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
__cs__ I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
__cs__ ( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Self evident truths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) iO Tillett Wright : Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
__cs__ Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
__cs__ And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
__cs__ So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
__cs__ That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
__cs__ I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
__cs__ Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
__cs__ So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
__cs__ Visibility really is key .
__cs__ Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
__cs__ Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
__cs__ Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
__cs__ Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
__cs__ But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
__cs__ In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
__cs__ It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
__cs__ It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
__cs__ At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; gays &quot; &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
__cs__ Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
__cs__ At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
__cs__ And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
__cs__ Can you quantify your openness ?
__cs__ Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
__cs__ Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
__cs__ I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; &quot; Grey . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
__cs__ And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
__cs__ I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
__cs__ The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
__cs__ And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
__cs__ Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
__cs__ Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
__cs__ Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
__cs__ Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
__cs__ Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
__cs__ After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
__cs__ Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
__cs__ So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
__cs__ Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
__cs__ Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
__cs__ What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
__cs__ And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
__cs__ At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
__cs__ So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
__cs__ Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
__cs__ It &apos;s too late .
__cs__ Because I already am all of those things .
__cs__ We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
__cs__ So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
__cs__ The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
__cs__ I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
__cs__ I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
__cs__ Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
__cs__ When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
__cs__ As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
__cs__ I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
__cs__ For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
__cs__ Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
__cs__ We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
__cs__ After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
__cs__ It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
__cs__ Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
__cs__ Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
__cs__ Some I even considered like my second home .
__cs__ But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
__cs__ A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
__cs__ That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
__cs__ A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
__cs__ That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
__cs__ Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
__cs__ Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
__cs__ Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
__cs__ Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
__cs__ Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
__cs__ In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
__cs__ This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
__cs__ Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
__cs__ Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
__cs__ There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
__cs__ So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
__cs__ Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
__cs__ Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
__cs__ I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
__cs__ I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
__cs__ I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
__cs__ I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
__cs__ I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
__cs__ As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
__cs__ In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
__cs__ The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
__cs__ It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
__cs__ How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
__cs__ Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
__cs__ They have nothing to compare it to .
__cs__ When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
__cs__ I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
__cs__ Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
__cs__ In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
__cs__ They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
__cs__ This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
__cs__ It was more like a restaurant .
__cs__ Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
__cs__ Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
__cs__ Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
__cs__ The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
__cs__ Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
__cs__ I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
__cs__ There were no back doors .
__cs__ There were no windows large enough to climb through .
__cs__ These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
__cs__ Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
__cs__ Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
__cs__ It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
__cs__ The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
__cs__ I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
__cs__ This is a family portrait .
__cs__ The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
__cs__ They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
__cs__ My interpreter told me their stories .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
__cs__ When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
__cs__ I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
__cs__ Wrong . They were all enslaved .
__cs__ Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
__cs__ This young child is eight years old .
__cs__ He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
__cs__ He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
__cs__ The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
__cs__ Many of them drown .
__cs__ For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
__cs__ Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
__cs__ I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
__cs__ in the cold , windy night .
__cs__ And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
__cs__ I want to introduce you to Kofi .
__cs__ Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
__cs__ I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
__cs__ Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
__cs__ Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
__cs__ Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
__cs__ Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
__cs__ He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
__cs__ At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
__cs__ Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
__cs__ After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
__cs__ Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
__cs__ Mercury is used in the extraction process .
__cs__ These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
__cs__ When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
__cs__ I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
__cs__ The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
__cs__ At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
__cs__ All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
__cs__ In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
__cs__ This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
__cs__ When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
__cs__ When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
__cs__ On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
__cs__ Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
__cs__ I want to shine a light on slavery .
__cs__ When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
__cs__ They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
__cs__ I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
__cs__ I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
__cs__ These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
__cs__ There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
__cs__ I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
__cs__ Thank you very much .

__cs__ The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
__cs__ But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
__cs__ Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .
__cs__ So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
__cs__ These pieces date back from the &apos; 40s to the late &apos; 50s .
__cs__ In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban .
__cs__ And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
__cs__ And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
__cs__ Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications .
__cs__ At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
__cs__ So I developed a whole range around — mass-produced range — that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
__cs__ We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
__cs__ This is our group , our main group of weavers .
__cs__ They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
__cs__ They all have bank accounts .
__cs__ They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
__cs__ It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
__cs__ This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
__cs__ And that &apos;s also modernized today , and it &apos;s supporting work for 300 weavers .
__cs__ And the rest says it all .
__cs__ Thank you very much .

__cs__ My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea .
__cs__ She wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of complimenting each other .
__cs__ So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom , and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner .
__cs__ And she said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we just stand here and compliment each other ?
__cs__ If you hear your name called , go and pick up your gift and sit down . &quot; &quot; What a wonderful idea , right ?
__cs__ What could go wrong ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Well , there were 40 of us to start with , and every time I heard someone &apos;s name called , I would give out the heartiest cheer .
__cs__ And then there were 20 people left , and 10 people left , and five left ...
__cs__ and three left .
__cs__ And I was one of them .
__cs__ And the compliments stopped .
__cs__ Well , at that moment , I was crying .
__cs__ And the teacher was freaking out .
__cs__ She was like , &quot; &quot; Hey , would anyone say anything nice about these people ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No one ? OK , why don &apos;t you go get your gift and sit down .
__cs__ So behave next year — someone might say something nice about you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , as I &apos;m describing this you , you probably know I remember this really well . ( Laughter )
__cs__ But I don &apos;t know who felt worse that day .
__cs__ Was it me or the teacher ?
__cs__ She must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds .
__cs__ And without the humor .
__cs__ You know , when you see people get roasted on TV , it was funny .
__cs__ There was nothing funny about that day .
__cs__ So that was one version of me , and I would die to avoid being in that situation again — to get rejected in public again .
__cs__ That &apos;s one version .
__cs__ Then fast-forward eight years .
__cs__ Bill Gates came to my hometown — Beijing , China — to speak , and I saw his message .
__cs__ I fell in love with that guy .
__cs__ I thought , wow , I know what I want to do now .
__cs__ That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them : &quot; &quot; By age 25 , I will build the biggest company in the world , and that company will buy Microsoft . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I totally embraced this idea of conquering the world — domination , right ?
__cs__ And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that letter .
__cs__ And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad handwriting , but I did highlight some key words .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So ...
__cs__ that was another version of me : one who will conquer the world .
__cs__ Well , then two years later , I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States .
__cs__ I jumped on it , because that was where Bill Gates lived , right ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey .
__cs__ Then , fast-forward another 14 years .
__cs__ I was 30 .
__cs__ Nope , I didn &apos;t build that company .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t even start .
__cs__ I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company .
__cs__ And I felt I was stuck ; I was stagnant .
__cs__ Why is that ?
__cs__ Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter ?
__cs__ It &apos;s not because he didn &apos;t try .
__cs__ It &apos;s because every time I had a new idea , every time I wanted to try something new , even at work — I wanted to make a proposal , I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group — I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old .
__cs__ One wanted to conquer the world — make a difference — another was afraid of rejection .
__cs__ And every time that six-year-old won .
__cs__ And this fear even persisted after I started my own company .
__cs__ I mean , I started my own company when I was 30 — if you want to be Bill Gates , you &apos;ve got to start sooner or later , right ?
__cs__ When I was an entrepreneur , I was presented with an investment opportunity , and then I was turned down .
__cs__ And that rejection hurt me .
__cs__ It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there .
__cs__ But then I thought , hey , would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection ?
__cs__ Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that ?
__cs__ No way .
__cs__ And this is where it clicked for me .
__cs__ OK , I can build a better company .
__cs__ I can build a better team or better product , but one thing for sure : I &apos;ve got to be a better leader .
__cs__ I &apos;ve got to be a better person .
__cs__ I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore .
__cs__ I have to put him back in his place .
__cs__ So this is where I went online and looked for help .
__cs__ Google was my friend .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I searched , &quot; &quot; How do I overcome the fear of rejection ? &quot; &quot; I came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from .
__cs__ Then I came up with a bunch of &quot; &quot; rah-rah &quot; &quot; inspirational articles about &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t take it personally , just overcome it . &quot; &quot; Who doesn &apos;t know that ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But why was I still so scared ?
__cs__ Then I found this website by luck .
__cs__ It &apos;s called rejectiontherapy.com.
__cs__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Rejection Therapy &quot; &quot; was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur .
__cs__ His name is Jason Comely .
__cs__ And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection , and every day get rejected at something , and then by the end , you desensitize yourself from the pain .
__cs__ And I loved that idea .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? I &apos;m going to do this .
__cs__ And I &apos;ll feel myself getting rejected 100 days . &quot; &quot; And I came up with my own rejection ideas , and I made a video blog out of it .
__cs__ And so here &apos;s what I did .
__cs__ This is what the blog looked like .
__cs__ Day One ...
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger .
__cs__ So this is where I went to where I was working .
__cs__ I came downstairs and I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk .
__cs__ He looked like a security guard .
__cs__ So I just approached him .
__cs__ And I was just walking and that was the longest walk of my life — hair on the back of my neck standing up , I was sweating and my heart was pounding .
__cs__ And I got there and said , &quot; Hey , sir , can I borrow 100 dollars from you ? &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;
__cs__ And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; Then I turned around , and I just ran .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I felt so embarrassed .
__cs__ But because I filmed myself — so that night I was watching myself getting rejected , I just saw how scared I was .
__cs__ I looked like this kid in &quot; &quot; The Sixth Sense . &quot; &quot; I saw dead people .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
__cs__ You know , he wasn &apos;t that menacing .
__cs__ He was a chubby , loveable guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he invited me to explain myself .
__cs__ And I could &apos;ve said many things .
__cs__ I could &apos;ve explained , I could &apos;ve negotiated .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t do any of that .
__cs__ All I did was run .
__cs__ I felt , wow , this is like a microcosm of my life .
__cs__ Every time I felt the slightest rejection , I would just run as fast as I could .
__cs__ And you know what ?
__cs__ The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run .
__cs__ I &apos;ll stay engaged .
__cs__ Day Two : Request a &quot; &quot; burger refill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s when I went to a burger joint , I finished lunch , and I went to the cashier and said , &quot; Hi , can I get a burger refill ? &quot; ( Laughter )
__cs__ He was all confused , like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a burger refill ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like a drink refill but with a burger . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Sorry , we don &apos;t do burger refill , man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So this is where rejection happened and I could have run , but I stayed .
__cs__ I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I love your burgers , I love your joint , and if you guys do a burger refill , I will love you guys more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , I &apos;ll tell my manager about it , and maybe we &apos;ll do it , but sorry , we can &apos;t do this today . &quot; &quot; Then I left .
__cs__ And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done burger refill .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
__cs__ But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time was no longer there , just because I stayed engaged — because I didn &apos;t run .
__cs__ I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , great , I &apos;m already learning things .
__cs__ Great . &quot; &quot; And then Day Three : Getting Olympic Doughnuts .
__cs__ This is where my life was turned upside down .
__cs__ I went to a Krispy Kreme .
__cs__ It &apos;s a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part of the United States .
__cs__ I &apos;m sure they have some here , too .
__cs__ And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; Can you make me doughnuts that look like Olympic symbols ?
__cs__ Basically , you interlink five doughnuts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say yes , right ?
__cs__ The doughnut maker took me so seriously .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So she put out paper , started jotting down the colors and the rings , and is like , &quot; &quot; How can I make this ? &quot; &quot; And then 15 minutes later , she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings .
__cs__ And I was so touched .
__cs__ I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
__cs__ And that video got over five million views on Youtube .
__cs__ The world couldn &apos;t believe that either .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) You know , because of that I was in newspapers , in talk shows , in everything .
__cs__ And I became famous .
__cs__ A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is awesome . &quot; &quot; But you know , fame and notoriety did not do anything to me .
__cs__ What I really wanted to do was learn , and to change myself .
__cs__ So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground — into this research project .
__cs__ I wanted to see what I could learn .
__cs__ And then I learned a lot of things .
__cs__ I discovered so many secrets .
__cs__ For example , I found if I just don &apos;t run , if I got rejected , I could actually turn a &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; into a &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and the magic word is , &quot; &quot; why . &quot; &quot; So one day I went to a stranger &apos;s house , I had this flower in my hand , knocked on the door and said , &quot; Hey , can I plant this flower in your backyard ? &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But before he could leave I said , &quot; Hey , can I know why ? &quot;
__cs__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard .
__cs__ I don &apos;t want to waste your flower .
__cs__ If you want to do this , go across the street and talk to Connie .
__cs__ She loves flowers . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__cs__ I went across and knocked on Connie &apos;s door .
__cs__ And she was so happy to see me .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And then half an hour later , there was this flower in Connie &apos;s backyard .
__cs__ I &apos;m sure it looks better now .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But had I left after the initial rejection , I would &apos;ve thought , well , it &apos;s because the guy didn &apos;t trust me , it &apos;s because I was crazy , because I didn &apos;t dress up well , I didn &apos;t look good .
__cs__ It was none of those .
__cs__ It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted .
__cs__ And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral , using a sales term .
__cs__ I converted a referral .
__cs__ Then one day — and I also learned that I can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes .
__cs__ So for example , one day I went to a Starbucks , and asked the manager , &quot; &quot; Hey , can I be a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; He was like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a Starbucks greeter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Do you know those Walmart greeters ?
__cs__ You know , those people who say &apos; hi &apos; to you before you walk in the store , and make sure you don &apos;t steal stuff , basically ?
__cs__ I want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s a good thing , actually — Actually , I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s a bad thing .
__cs__ And he was like , &quot; &quot; Oh &quot; &quot; — yeah , this is how he looked , his name is Eric — and he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; This is how he was hearing me . &quot; &quot; Not sure . &quot; &quot; Then I ask him , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s really weird , man . &quot; &quot; But as soon as he said that , his whole demeanor changed .
__cs__ It &apos;s as if he &apos;s putting all the doubt on the floor .
__cs__ And he said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you can do this , just don &apos;t get too weird . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter .
__cs__ I said &quot; &quot; hi &quot; &quot; to every customer that walked in , and gave them holiday cheers .
__cs__ By the way , I don &apos;t know what your career trajectory is , don &apos;t be a greeter .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) It was really boring .
__cs__ But then I found I could do this because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; I mentioned the doubt that he was having .
__cs__ And because I mentioned , &quot; &quot; Is that weird ? &quot; &quot; , that means I wasn &apos;t weird .
__cs__ That means I was actually thinking just like him , seeing this as a weird thing .
__cs__ And again , and again , I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have before I ask the question , I gained their trust .
__cs__ People were more likely to say yes to me .
__cs__ And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...
__cs__ by asking .
__cs__ You know , I came from four generations of teachers , and my grandma has always told me , &quot; &quot; Hey Jia , you can do anything you want , but it &apos;d be great if you became a teacher . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But I wanted to be an entrepreneur , so I didn &apos;t .
__cs__ But it has always been my dream to actually teach something .
__cs__ So I said , &quot; &quot; What if I just ask and teach a college class ? &quot; &quot; I lived in Austin at the time , so I went to University of Texas at Austin and knocked on professors &apos; doors and said , &quot; &quot; Can I teach your class ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t get anywhere the first couple of times .
__cs__ But because I didn &apos;t run — I kept doing it — and on the third try the professor was very impressed .
__cs__ He was like , &quot; &quot; No one has done this before . &quot; &quot; And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , I can use this .
__cs__ Why don &apos;t you come back in two months ? I &apos;ll fit you in my curriculum . &quot; &quot; And two months later I was teaching a class .
__cs__ This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture .
__cs__ You know , sometimes you get rejected by lighting , you know ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But wow — when I finished teaching that class , I walked out crying , because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking .
__cs__ I used to think I have to accomplish all these things — have to be a great entrepreneur , or get a PhD to teach — but no , I just asked , and I could teach .
__cs__ And in that picture , which you can &apos;t see , I quoted Martin Luther King , Jr .
__cs__ Why ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections .
__cs__ People like Martin Luther King , Jr . , like Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela , or even Jesus Christ .
__cs__ These people did not let rejection define them .
__cs__ They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves .
__cs__ And they embraced rejection .
__cs__ And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about rejection , and in my case , rejection was my curse , was my boogeyman .
__cs__ It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it .
__cs__ Then I started embracing it .
__cs__ I turned that into the biggest gift in my life .
__cs__ I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities .
__cs__ I use my blog , I use my talk , I use the book I just published , and I &apos;m even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection .
__cs__ When you get rejected in life , when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure , consider the possibilities .
__cs__ Don &apos;t run .
__cs__ If you just embrace them , they might become your gifts as well .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__cs__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__cs__ Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
__cs__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__cs__ They kill our livestock .
__cs__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__cs__ My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__cs__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__cs__ The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__cs__ So they kill the lions .
__cs__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__cs__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__cs__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__cs__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__cs__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__cs__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
__cs__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__cs__ And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
__cs__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
__cs__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__cs__ So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__cs__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__cs__ So I had an idea .
__cs__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
__cs__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__cs__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__cs__ So I set up everything .
__cs__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
__cs__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__cs__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__cs__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__cs__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__cs__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__cs__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__cs__ One of them was this grandmother .
__cs__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__cs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__cs__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__cs__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__cs__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__cs__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__cs__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__cs__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__cs__ And here I am today .
__cs__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__cs__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__cs__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__cs__ Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__cs__ So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
__cs__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__cs__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__cs__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
__cs__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
__cs__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
__cs__ Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
__cs__ Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
__cs__ Disappears right into the background .
__cs__ So , he &apos;s bluffing . Let &apos;s do it backwards .
__cs__ One , two , three .
__cs__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__cs__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__cs__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
__cs__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__cs__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__cs__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__cs__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__cs__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__cs__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__cs__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__cs__ ( Music ) ( Applause )
__cs__ This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 .
__cs__ We made this kindergarten to be a circle .
__cs__ It &apos;s a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof .
__cs__ If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
__cs__ This is how the rooftop looks .
__cs__ And why did we design this ?
__cs__ The principal of this kindergarten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a handrail . &quot;
__cs__ I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ?
__cs__ So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a handrail . &quot;
__cs__ But we could keep that idea around the trees .
__cs__ There are three trees popping through .
__cs__ And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
__cs__ But of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
__cs__ They fall into the net .
__cs__ And you get more , and more , more .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
__cs__ The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
__cs__ It looks so nice from underneath .
__cs__ Monkeys in the zoo .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Feeding time .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
__cs__ And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
__cs__ And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps .
__cs__ You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spray water to your friends , and the shower , and the one in front is quite normal .
__cs__ But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his boots , he &apos;s putting water into his boots .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) This kindergarten is completely open , most of the year .
__cs__ And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
__cs__ So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
__cs__ And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
__cs__ So there is no acoustic barrier at all .
__cs__ When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
__cs__ But in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
__cs__ Because there is no boundary .
__cs__ And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
__cs__ He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
__cs__ But here , just they leave and come back .
__cs__ It &apos;s a natural process .
__cs__ And secondly , we consider noise very important .
__cs__ You know that children sleep better in noise .
__cs__ They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
__cs__ And in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
__cs__ And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
__cs__ They need noise .
__cs__ And you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
__cs__ You are not supposed to be in silence .
__cs__ And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
__cs__ You know , it &apos;s completely open .
__cs__ And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
__cs__ In summer you go swimming .
__cs__ The sand is 50 degrees .
__cs__ And also , you should know that you are waterproof .
__cs__ You never melt in rain .
__cs__ So , children are supposed to be outside .
__cs__ So that is how we should treat them .
__cs__ This is how they divide classrooms .
__cs__ They are supposed to help teachers .
__cs__ They don &apos;t .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
__cs__ A classroom .
__cs__ And a washbasin .
__cs__ They talk to each other around the well .
__cs__ And there are always some trees in the classroom .
__cs__ A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Monkeys . ( Laughter )
__cs__ And each classroom has at least one skylight .
__cs__ And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas .
__cs__ This is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
__cs__ The building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
__cs__ And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
__cs__ So you have to consider safety .
__cs__ So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
__cs__ They tried to go in .
__cs__ He hit his head .
__cs__ He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
__cs__ He is resilient . It &apos;s my son .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
__cs__ And then we put other children .
__cs__ The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo , as you know .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
__cs__ Now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
__cs__ And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
__cs__ This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
__cs__ Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
__cs__ And the circumference of this building is 183 meters .
__cs__ So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
__cs__ And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
__cs__ But the surprise is yet to come .
__cs__ The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average .
__cs__ And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens .
__cs__ The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
__cs__ Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
__cs__ My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
__cs__ They need to get some injury .
__cs__ And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
__cs__ I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
__cs__ And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )

__cs__ Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
__cs__ They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
__cs__ Now , to be clear , North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified , board-certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients .
__cs__ And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo .
__cs__ And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
__cs__ You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
__cs__ Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology .
__cs__ And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jungles .
__cs__ But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
__cs__ But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
__cs__ I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook .
__cs__ Fear-induced heart failure .
__cs__ Around the year 2000 , human cardiologists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
__cs__ Some human patients harm themselves .
__cs__ Some pluck out patches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
__cs__ Some animal patients also harm themselves .
__cs__ There are birds that pluck out feathers .
__cs__ There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed .
__cs__ Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis .
__cs__ Can geographic information make you healthy ?
__cs__ In 2001 I got hit by a train .
__cs__ My train was a heart attack .
__cs__ I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
__cs__ And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
__cs__ I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
__cs__ So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
__cs__ Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
__cs__ That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
__cs__ Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
__cs__ And you know why I understand that ?
__cs__ Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
__cs__ Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
__cs__ I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
__cs__ But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
__cs__ What does that mean , my environment ?
__cs__ Well , it can mean a lot of things .
__cs__ This is my life . These are my life places .
__cs__ We all have these .
__cs__ While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
__cs__ Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
__cs__ And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
__cs__ You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
__cs__ And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
__cs__ So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
__cs__ And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
__cs__ And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
__cs__ Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
__cs__ I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
__cs__ I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
__cs__ You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities — 19 years of this .
__cs__ And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
__cs__ So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
__cs__ OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
__cs__ Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
__cs__ They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
__cs__ Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
__cs__ And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
__cs__ It was insidious and it was really happening .
__cs__ Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
__cs__ And I moved to Redlands California .
__cs__ Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
__cs__ Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
__cs__ Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
__cs__ If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
__cs__ So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
__cs__ Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
__cs__ The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
__cs__ No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
__cs__ They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
__cs__ They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
__cs__ Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
__cs__ This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
__cs__ Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
__cs__ Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
__cs__ So , how many people are in the white ?
__cs__ How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
__cs__ Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
__cs__ How many have spent it in the red places ?
__cs__ Oh , not so lucky .
__cs__ There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
__cs__ They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
__cs__ But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
__cs__ And it &apos;s not in yours either .
__cs__ So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
__cs__ He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
__cs__ And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
__cs__ And this is where he has spent most of his time .
__cs__ If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
__cs__ Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
__cs__ We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
__cs__ And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
__cs__ Did you know that data existed ?
__cs__ For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
__cs__ So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
__cs__ This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
__cs__ This might be what we end up with .
__cs__ This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
__cs__ This could be my little assessment .
__cs__ And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
__cs__ I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
__cs__ Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
__cs__ It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
__cs__ And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
__cs__ These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
__cs__ The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
__cs__ It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
__cs__ But it will also be useful for us .
__cs__ I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
__cs__ Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
__cs__ With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
__cs__ Just look at that for a minute .
__cs__ That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
__cs__ That was what he was talking about on that quote .
__cs__ And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
__cs__ So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
__cs__ So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
__cs__ And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
__cs__ When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
__cs__ But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
__cs__ After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
__cs__ It is not important if I like the job or not .
__cs__ But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
__cs__ That is me playing my imaginary piano .
__cs__ An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
__cs__ I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
__cs__ But no adults liked the idea .
__cs__ No adults believed I was serious .
__cs__ Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
__cs__ So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
__cs__ My dream would never come true .
__cs__ I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
__cs__ But that &apos;s so unfair .
__cs__ So I was determined to find another calling .
__cs__ Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
__cs__ I turned to books .
__cs__ I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
__cs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
__cs__ Books banned in China , of course .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
__cs__ That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
__cs__ The Bible is interesting , but strange .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
__cs__ But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
__cs__ Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
__cs__ It offers many insights .
__cs__ For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
__cs__ It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
__cs__ A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
__cs__ Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
__cs__ It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
__cs__ There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
__cs__ Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
__cs__ So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
__cs__ So I started reading books in pairs .
__cs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
__cs__ For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
__cs__ For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
__cs__ So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
__cs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
__cs__ For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
__cs__ I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
__cs__ Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
__cs__ I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
__cs__ Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
__cs__ Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
__cs__ So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
__cs__ So may books be always with you .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high speeds .
__cs__ That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
__cs__ I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : FIFA , vuvuzela , weird jokes about octopi .
__cs__ But the one that &apos;s really been sort of stressing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
__cs__ It &apos;s been a major trending topic .
__cs__ Being a monolingual American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
__cs__ So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help .
__cs__ They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
__cs__ In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
__cs__ Narrator : A word about Galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
__cs__ Every year , more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades .
__cs__ Ethan Zuckerman : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
__cs__ It turns out that , not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Galvao abuse .
__cs__ Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao .
__cs__ And it &apos;s terribly endangered .
__cs__ The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Brazilian friends tell me — is pitching in to help out .
__cs__ It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single — actually five or six new singles , as near as I can tell — titled &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
__cs__ Now , most of you have figured out that this was a prank , and actually a very , very good one .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
__cs__ In Portugese , it means &quot; &quot; Shut your mouth , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And it specifically refers to this guy , Galvao Bueno , who &apos;s the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo .
__cs__ And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
__cs__ He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again .
__cs__ So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea , put up this banner , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cala a boca , Galvao . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks .
__cs__ Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
__cs__ And the first lesson , which I think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
__cs__ So as long as activism is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
__cs__ The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter .
__cs__ There &apos;s more than five million of them .
__cs__ As far as national representation , 11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter .
__cs__ That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
__cs__ Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
__cs__ Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
__cs__ Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
__cs__ And if you are like me , a big , geeky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky , white , American guys .
__cs__ And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space .
__cs__ It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heavily African-American space .
__cs__ Twitter recently did some research .
__cs__ They looked at their local population .
__cs__ They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-American .
__cs__ That &apos;s about twice as high as African-Americans are represented in the population .
__cs__ And again , that was very shocking to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
__cs__ And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .
__cs__ And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African-American conversations .
__cs__ This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg , two amazing visualization designers , who looked at a weekend &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
__cs__ It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation , that cookout is a mostly black conversation .
__cs__ And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
__cs__ You click on that cookout tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it .
__cs__ But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
__cs__ We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend Eli Pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
__cs__ And we tend not to see that wider picture .
__cs__ Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
__cs__ If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Being Digital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
__cs__ Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
__cs__ He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
__cs__ And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of Evian water on the table .
__cs__ And Negroponte says this is crazy .
__cs__ This is the old economy .
__cs__ It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
__cs__ We &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is speedy , it &apos;s weightless .
__cs__ It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
__cs__ And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
__cs__ Now , Negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
__cs__ He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
__cs__ It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
__cs__ If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bottled in Fiji , shipped at great expense to the United States .
__cs__ It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film .
__cs__ It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music .
__cs__ It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fiji .
__cs__ There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
__cs__ There &apos;s crackdowns on the press .
__cs__ It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
__cs__ Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
__cs__ I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
__cs__ We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
__cs__ And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like airline routes .
__cs__ It includes things like the Internet cables .
__cs__ We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
__cs__ You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bangalore later today .
__cs__ Two hops , you &apos;re in Suva , the capitol of Fiji .
__cs__ It &apos;s all right there .
__cs__ When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
__cs__ You start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
__cs__ It &apos;s extremely lumpy .
__cs__ There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
__cs__ There &apos;s basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York .
__cs__ but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
__cs__ You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
__cs__ And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
__cs__ When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
__cs__ So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
__cs__ The world is , in fact , getting more global .
__cs__ It &apos;s getting more connected .
__cs__ More of problems are global in scale .
__cs__ More of our economics is global in scale .
__cs__ And our media is less global by the day .
__cs__ If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
__cs__ That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
__cs__ And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world .
__cs__ Here &apos;s a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk .
__cs__ Alisa &apos;s the president of Public Radio International .
__cs__ And she made a cartogram , which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month .
__cs__ And you see that when you distort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S.
__cs__ and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve invaded .
__cs__ And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
__cs__ And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dreadful , and I agree that it &apos;s dreadful — I &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
__cs__ When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
__cs__ It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
__cs__ Here &apos;s a map made by Mark Graham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
__cs__ A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo-coded .
__cs__ And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
__cs__ Even within Wikipedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
__cs__ In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God forbid from the U.S.
__cs__ You probably won &apos;t .
__cs__ If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites .
__cs__ It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
__cs__ So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism .
__cs__ We look at the internet .
__cs__ We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
__cs__ We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
__cs__ And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking Boston Red Sox scores .
__cs__ So this is a real problem — not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discussing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
__cs__ This is a problem we have to solve .
__cs__ So here &apos;s the good news .
__cs__ For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
__cs__ This is a group called Global Voices .
__cs__ This is a team of bloggers from around the world .
__cs__ Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
__cs__ We started in 2004 .
__cs__ You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
__cs__ Nor do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
__cs__ But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
__cs__ The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
__cs__ In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
__cs__ And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
__cs__ What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encouragement .
__cs__ One of those dark spots is Madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
__cs__ And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
__cs__ They were doing something much simpler .
__cs__ It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
__cs__ but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup .
__cs__ Most independent media was shut down .
__cs__ And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
__cs__ So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publishing their own thoughts , publishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
__cs__ Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m guessing most people here don &apos;t speak Malagasy .
__cs__ I &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
__cs__ Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
__cs__ If you &apos;re using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page .
__cs__ Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine translation of the page .
__cs__ And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dreadful with Chinese .
__cs__ And the results can be pretty funny .
__cs__ What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this .
__cs__ And if you think this is absurd , it &apos;s not .
__cs__ There &apos;s a group right now in China called Yeeyan .
__cs__ And Yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
__cs__ They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
__cs__ They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
__cs__ They put it online for free .
__cs__ It &apos;s the project of a guy named Zhang Lei , who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn &apos;t believe how biased American media coverage was .
__cs__ And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start translating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Yeeyan ?
__cs__ Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
__cs__ My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
__cs__ So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guarantee that we &apos;re going to find it .
__cs__ When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
__cs__ We use a lot of search .
__cs__ And search is terrific if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
__cs__ But if what you &apos;re looking for is serendipity , if you want to stumble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
__cs__ What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
__cs__ The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock .
__cs__ You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
__cs__ And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other flocks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
__cs__ To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .
__cs__ You need a guide .
__cs__ So this is Amira Al Hussaini . She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices .
__cs__ She has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
__cs__ Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
__cs__ And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of Ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
__cs__ She has to know something about what stories are available .
__cs__ Basically , she &apos;s a deejay .
__cs__ She &apos;s a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
__cs__ I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
__cs__ I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience .
__cs__ I know Amira .
__cs__ I can ask her what to read .
__cs__ But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
__cs__ And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
__cs__ So once you start widening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start translating , once you start curating , you end up in some really weird places .
__cs__ This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is AfriGadget .
__cs__ And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
__cs__ And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi , who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel .
__cs__ And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conceivably care about this ? &quot;
__cs__ And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
__cs__ This is Erik Hersman . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
__cs__ He goes by the moniker White African .
__cs__ He &apos;s both a very well known American geek , but he &apos;s also Kenyan ; he was born in Sudan , grew up in Kenya .
__cs__ He is a bridge figure .
__cs__ He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
__cs__ And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology , about innovating from constraint , about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials .
__cs__ He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
__cs__ These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
__cs__ But the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
__cs__ And that &apos;s where we start talking about xenophiles .
__cs__ So if I found myself in the NFL , I suspect I would spend my off-season nursing my wounds , enjoying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hip-hop album .
__cs__ Dhani Jones , who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
__cs__ Dhani has a television show .
__cs__ It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , Dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
__cs__ He finds a local sporting team .
__cs__ He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
__cs__ And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing .
__cs__ It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
__cs__ For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
__cs__ For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
__cs__ But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
__cs__ The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia .
__cs__ My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TEDGlobal — is that most of you are xenophiles , whether or not you use that term .
__cs__ My challenge instead is this .
__cs__ It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
__cs__ We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have .
__cs__ We have to fix our media .
__cs__ We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
__cs__ We have to fix our immigration policy .
__cs__ We need to look at ways of creating serendipity , of making translation pervasive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
__cs__ And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
__cs__ That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Basically , there &apos;s a major demographic event going on .
__cs__ And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point . So the world now is a map of connectivity .
__cs__ It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
__cs__ What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
__cs__ The aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
__cs__ So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emptying out .
__cs__ The question is , why ?
__cs__ And here &apos;s the unromantic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Renaissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule .
__cs__ And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty .
__cs__ They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
__cs__ They &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
__cs__ They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
__cs__ One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
__cs__ They are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
__cs__ Education is the main event that can happen in cities .
__cs__ What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
__cs__ Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
__cs__ There &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . Everyone works .
__cs__ One-sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
__cs__ So here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
__cs__ And here &apos;s the second punch line .
__cs__ That &apos;s the news from downtown . Here it is in perspective .
__cs__ Stars have shined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
__cs__ Now we &apos;re shining right back up .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
__cs__ Guess who was the performing guest ?
__cs__ Susan Boyle .
__cs__ And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
__cs__ It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
__cs__ Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
__cs__ That was hilarious .
__cs__ So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
__cs__ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
__cs__ And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
__cs__ Well , being different is not that difficult .
__cs__ We are all different from different perspectives .
__cs__ But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
__cs__ You may have the chance to make a difference .
__cs__ My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
__cs__ I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton — it &apos;s still there .
__cs__ So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
__cs__ That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
__cs__ Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
__cs__ The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
__cs__ So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
__cs__ Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
__cs__ But actually , they were impressed by my words .
__cs__ And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
__cs__ After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
__cs__ So I was on a national television prime-time show .
__cs__ And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
__cs__ ( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
__cs__ Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
__cs__ So we do a lot of things .
__cs__ I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
__cs__ And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
__cs__ But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
__cs__ I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
__cs__ I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
__cs__ I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
__cs__ But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
__cs__ How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
__cs__ So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
__cs__ First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
__cs__ Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei — 20 years old , beautiful .
__cs__ She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
__cs__ And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
__cs__ She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
__cs__ The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
__cs__ So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
__cs__ All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
__cs__ It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
__cs__ But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
__cs__ It is still boiling .
__cs__ It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
__cs__ And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
__cs__ Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
__cs__ Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
__cs__ On Tencent , 200 million .
__cs__ The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
__cs__ About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
__cs__ And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
__cs__ But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
__cs__ So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
__cs__ So how are they different ?
__cs__ First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
__cs__ And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
__cs__ That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
__cs__ Most of them have fairly good education .
__cs__ The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
__cs__ In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
__cs__ But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
__cs__ And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
__cs__ So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
__cs__ So making a living is not that easy for young people .
__cs__ College graduates are not in short supply .
__cs__ In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
__cs__ So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
__cs__ That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
__cs__ Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
__cs__ They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
__cs__ Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
__cs__ They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
__cs__ And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
__cs__ Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
__cs__ But they died because of all different personal reasons .
__cs__ But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
__cs__ For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
__cs__ So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
__cs__ These diagrams show a more general social background .
__cs__ The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
__cs__ But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
__cs__ The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
__cs__ Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
__cs__ And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
__cs__ And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
__cs__ So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
__cs__ So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
__cs__ Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
__cs__ For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
__cs__ And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
__cs__ Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
__cs__ So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
__cs__ So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
__cs__ Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
__cs__ We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
__cs__ And guess what , we have faked beef .
__cs__ They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
__cs__ And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
__cs__ So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
__cs__ And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
__cs__ While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
__cs__ China is soon to pass the U.S.
__cs__ as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
__cs__ But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
__cs__ They &apos;re not rich at all .
__cs__ They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
__cs__ And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
__cs__ But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
__cs__ So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
__cs__ It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
__cs__ And also , people are doing good through social media .
__cs__ And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
__cs__ People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
__cs__ And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
__cs__ And here also people are helping to find missing children .
__cs__ A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
__cs__ After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
__cs__ So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
__cs__ Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
__cs__ People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
__cs__ How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
__cs__ And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
__cs__ I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
__cs__ And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ A big challenge is , how should the iPads be used , and what apps should we put on the iPads ?
__cs__ Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
__cs__ My job is that I lie to children , but they &apos;re honest lies .
__cs__ I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from Pablo Picasso , &quot; &quot; We all know that Art is not truth .
__cs__ Art is a lie that makes us realize truth or at least the truth that is given us to understand .
__cs__ The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies . &quot; &quot; I first heard this when I was a kid , and I loved it , but I had no idea what it meant .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So I thought , you know what , it &apos;s what I &apos;m here to talk to you today about , though , truth and lies , fiction and reality .
__cs__ So how could I untangle this knotted bunch of sentences ?
__cs__ And I said , I &apos;ve got PowerPoint . Let &apos;s do a Venn diagram .
__cs__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Truth . Lies . &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) So there it is , right there , boom .
__cs__ That liminal space , that &apos;s art .
__cs__ All right . Venn diagram . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But that &apos;s actually not very helpful either .
__cs__ The thing that made me understand that quote and really kind of what art , at least the art of fiction , was , was working with kids .
__cs__ I used to be a summer camp counselor .
__cs__ It was a sports summer camp for four- to six-year-olds .
__cs__ I was in charge of the four-year-olds , which is good , because four-year-olds can &apos;t play sports , and neither can I.
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I play sports at a four-year-old level , so what would happen is the kids would dribble around some cones , and then got hot , and then they would go sit underneath the tree where I was already sitting — ( Laughter ) — and I would just make up stories and tell them to them and I would tell them stories about my life .
__cs__ I would tell them about how , on the weekends , I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England .
__cs__ And soon , other kids who weren &apos;t even in my group of kids , they would come up to me , and they would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re Mac Barnett , right ?
__cs__ You &apos;re the guy who spies for the Queen of England . &quot; &quot; And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers to come up and ask me that question .
__cs__ And I realized that the stories that I was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting .
__cs__ And so Riley was like , &quot; &quot; That will never happen .
__cs__ That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot; &quot; And so , on the last day of camp , I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy , and then at lunchtime , I was like , &quot; Riley , why don &apos;t you go over there and see what you &apos;ve done . &quot;
__cs__ And — ( Laughter ) — she went trudging through the ivy , and then her eyes just got so wide , and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her , and one of the kids was like , &quot; &quot; Hey , why is there a sticker on this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I was like , &quot; &quot; That is also why I say do not throw your stickers in the ivy .
__cs__ Put them in the trash can . It ruins nature when you do this . &quot; &quot; And Riley carried that melon around with her all day , and she was so proud .
__cs__ And Riley knew she didn &apos;t grow a melon in seven days , but she also knew that she did , and it &apos;s a weird place , but it &apos;s not just a place that kids can get to .
__cs__ It &apos;s anything . Art can get us to that place .
__cs__ She was right in that place in the middle , that place which you could call art or fiction .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to call it wonder .
__cs__ It &apos;s not just kids who can get there .
__cs__ Adults can too , and we get there when we read .
__cs__ It &apos;s why in two days , people will be descending on Dublin to take the walking tour of Bloomsday and see everything that happened in &quot; &quot; Ulysses , &quot; &quot; even though none of that happened .
__cs__ and yet we also know that they are .
__cs__ Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can , and that &apos;s why I love writing for kids .
__cs__ I think kids are the best audience for serious literary fiction .
__cs__ When I was a kid , I was obsessed with secret door novels , things like &quot; &quot; Narnia , &quot; &quot; where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land .
__cs__ There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about .
__cs__ After college , my first job was working behind one of these secret doors .
__cs__ This is a place called 826 Valencia .
__cs__ It &apos;s at 826 Valencia Street in the Mission in San Francisco , and when I worked there , there was a publishing company headquartered there called McSweeney &apos;s , a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia , but then the front of it was a strange shop .
__cs__ They have eyepatches in lots of colors , because when it &apos;s springtime , pirates want to go wild .
__cs__ You don &apos;t know . Black is boring . Pastel .
__cs__ And the store , strangely , people came to them and bought things , and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center , which was behind it , but to me , more important was the fact that I think the quality of work you do , kids would come and get instruction in writing , and when you have to walk this weird , liminal , fictional space like this to go do your writing , it &apos;s going to affect the kind of work that you make .
__cs__ It &apos;s a secret door that you can walk through .
__cs__ So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles , and it was my job to build the store down there .
__cs__ So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart .
__cs__ That &apos;s our motto : &quot; &quot; Whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles .
__cs__ Our friendly staff is ready to help you .
__cs__ There &apos;s our Employees of the Month , including Genghis Khan , Charles Dickens .
__cs__ Some great people have come up through our ranks .
__cs__ This is our kind of pharmacy section .
__cs__ Our architect was covered in red syrup .
__cs__ It looked like he had just murdered somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular architect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
__cs__ Mammoth Chunks . These things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
__cs__ Barbarian repellent . It &apos;s full of salad and potpourri — things that barbarians hate .
__cs__ Dead languages .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
__cs__ And Viking Odorant , which comes in lots of great scents : toenails , sweat and rotten vegetables , pyre ash .
__cs__ Because we believe that Axe Body Spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield , not under your arms . ( Laughter ) And these are robot emotion chips , so robots can feel love or fear .
__cs__ Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude , which we did not expect .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) We did not think that was going to happen .
__cs__ And it &apos;s a very special space , because it &apos;s this weird space in the front .
__cs__ The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
__cs__ You can &apos;t find the seams on the fiction , and I love that . It &apos;s this little bit of fiction that &apos;s colonized the real world .
__cs__ I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
__cs__ There &apos;s a term called metafiction , and that &apos;s just stories about stories , and meta &apos;s having a moment now .
__cs__ It &apos;s almost as old as storytelling itself .
__cs__ And one metafictive technique is breaking the fourth wall . Right ?
__cs__ It &apos;s when an actor will turn to the audience and say , &quot; &quot; I am an actor , these are just rafters . &quot; &quot; And even that supposedly honest moment , I would argue , is in service of the lie , but it &apos;s supposed to foreground the artificiality of the fiction .
__cs__ For me , I kind of prefer the opposite .
__cs__ If I &apos;m going to break down the fourth wall , I want fiction to escape and come into the real world .
__cs__ I want a book to be a secret door that opens and lets the stories out into reality .
__cs__ And so I try to do this in my books .
__cs__ And here &apos;s just one example .
__cs__ This is the first book that I ever made .
__cs__ So it &apos;s delivered overnight by FedUp .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And he has to take it to school with him .
__cs__ He lives in San Francisco — very tough city to own a blue whale in .
__cs__ A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
__cs__ This market &apos;s crazy , everybody .
__cs__ But underneath the jacket is this case , and that &apos;s the cover underneath the book , the jacket , and there &apos;s an ad that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial for a blue whale .
__cs__ And you can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and we &apos;ll send you a whale .
__cs__ And kids do write in .
__cs__ So here &apos;s a letter . It says , &quot; &quot; Dear people , I bet you 10 bucks you won &apos;t send me a blue whale .
__cs__ But it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you .
__cs__ He &apos;s got a phone number , and you can call and leave him a message .
__cs__ And when you call and leave him a message , you just , on the outgoing message , it &apos;s just whale sounds and then a beep , which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound .
__cs__ And they get a picture of their whale too .
__cs__ So this is Randolph , and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in , and I &apos;ll play you some of Nico &apos;s message .
__cs__ This is the first message I ever got from Nico .
__cs__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
__cs__ I am your owner , Randolph . Hello .
__cs__ So this is the first time I can ever talk to you , and I might talk to you soon another day . Bye .
__cs__ Mac Barnett : So Nico called back , like , an hour later .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s another one of Nico &apos;s messages .
__cs__ ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , this is Nico .
__cs__ I haven &apos;t talked to you for a long time , but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday , yeah , Saturday or Sunday , so now I &apos;m calling you again to say hello and I wonder what you &apos;re doing right now , and I &apos;m going to probably call you again tomorrow or today , so I &apos;ll talk to you later . Bye .
__cs__ MB : So he did , he called back that day again .
__cs__ He &apos;s left over 25 messages for Randolph over four years .
__cs__ You find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that he likes a little bit less — ( Laughter ) — and the crossword puzzles that he does , and this is — I &apos;ll play you one more message from Nico .
__cs__ This is the Christmas message from Nico .
__cs__ &#91; Beep &#93; ( Audio ) Nico : Hello , Randolph , sorry I haven &apos;t talked to you in a long time .
__cs__ It &apos;s just that I &apos;ve been so busy because school started , as you might not know , probably , since you &apos;re a whale , you don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a merry Christmas .
__cs__ So have a nice Christmas , and bye-bye , Randolph . Goodbye .
__cs__ MB : I actually got Nico , I hadn &apos;t heard from in 18 months , and he just left a message two days ago .
__cs__ His voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to Randolph as well .
__cs__ But Nico &apos;s the best reader I could hope for .
__cs__ I would want anyone I was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things that I create .
__cs__ I feel lucky . Kids like Nico are the best readers , and they deserve the best stories we can give them .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
__cs__ I feel so fortunate .
__cs__ I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
__cs__ I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
__cs__ It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
__cs__ But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
__cs__ I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
__cs__ Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
__cs__ And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
__cs__ She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Tweets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
__cs__ She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
__cs__ But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table — peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
__cs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
__cs__ Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
__cs__ And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
__cs__ And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
__cs__ And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
__cs__ It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
__cs__ And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
__cs__ It all started back in 1977 .
__cs__ I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
__cs__ And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
__cs__ And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses — and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
__cs__ So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
__cs__ It was an experimental education program .
__cs__ It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
__cs__ And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit — my concession to convention — kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
__cs__ And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
__cs__ And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
__cs__ There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
__cs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
__cs__ Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
__cs__ She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question cleared the space .
__cs__ There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
__cs__ And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
__cs__ So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
__cs__ His name is Chris Farina .
__cs__ Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
__cs__ Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
__cs__ ( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot; &quot; He proposed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
__cs__ He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
__cs__ Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
__cs__ So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
__cs__ It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
__cs__ And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
__cs__ And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the eerie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
__cs__ What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
__cs__ I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
__cs__ That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
__cs__ I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
__cs__ And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
__cs__ And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
__cs__ And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
__cs__ And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
__cs__ You know the one .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
__cs__ I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
__cs__ And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
__cs__ And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
__cs__ My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
__cs__ That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
__cs__ And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
__cs__ And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a gesture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
__cs__ I am one of her teaching gestures .
__cs__ And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
__cs__ And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
__cs__ It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
__cs__ And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
__cs__ I &apos;m not here alone .
__cs__ There are many people on this stage right now .
__cs__ And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
__cs__ It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
__cs__ I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
__cs__ We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
__cs__ I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
__cs__ So I thought , well they like to play games .
__cs__ I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 — but something interactive .
__cs__ And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
__cs__ And it has four Plexiglass layers .
__cs__ There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
__cs__ There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
__cs__ There are four countries around the board .
__cs__ The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
__cs__ They have different assets , commercial and military .
__cs__ And each country has a cabinet .
__cs__ There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
__cs__ I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
__cs__ I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
__cs__ There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
__cs__ There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
__cs__ And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
__cs__ So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
__cs__ I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
__cs__ And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
__cs__ There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
__cs__ If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
__cs__ So I also have in the game a saboteur — some child — it &apos;s basically a troublemaker — and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
__cs__ But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
__cs__ And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
__cs__ The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; Fourth-graders understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
__cs__ They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
__cs__ Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
__cs__ And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
__cs__ I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
__cs__ I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
__cs__ The students run the game .
__cs__ I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
__cs__ So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
__cs__ ( Video ) Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
__cs__ You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
__cs__ See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
__cs__ John Hunter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
__cs__ And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
__cs__ And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
__cs__ And so I apologize to them as well .
__cs__ I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
__cs__ Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
__cs__ Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
__cs__ ( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
__cs__ ( Chatter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
__cs__ It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
__cs__ I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
__cs__ There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
__cs__ It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
__cs__ So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
__cs__ In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
__cs__ And the Defense Minister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
__cs__ And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
__cs__ Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
__cs__ She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
__cs__ And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
__cs__ We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
__cs__ This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her girlfriends she said that .
__cs__ That &apos;s a breach there .
__cs__ And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) They are the toughest opponents .
__cs__ And we were very upset .
__cs__ I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
__cs__ But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
__cs__ So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
__cs__ Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
__cs__ She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
__cs__ Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
__cs__ That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
__cs__ I could not have designed that in teaching it .
__cs__ It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
__cs__ We have a letter in the game .
__cs__ If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
__cs__ You have to write a letter to their parents — the fictional parents of your fictional troops — explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
__cs__ So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
__cs__ And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County — and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
__cs__ It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
__cs__ She read two sentences .
__cs__ By the third sentence , she was in tears .
__cs__ I was in tears .
__cs__ Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
__cs__ We all lose .
__cs__ And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
__cs__ I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
__cs__ He &apos;s been in many battles .
__cs__ ( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
__cs__ I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
__cs__ But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
__cs__ One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
__cs__ And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
__cs__ JH : I get chills every time I see that .
__cs__ That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
__cs__ And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
__cs__ But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
__cs__ We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
__cs__ We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
__cs__ So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
__cs__ This is about my friend Brennan .
__cs__ We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
__cs__ The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
__cs__ Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
__cs__ The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
__cs__ He says , &quot; &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
__cs__ So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
__cs__ There was no way they could win .
__cs__ And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time — there was about a minute left — and despair just settled over the room .
__cs__ I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
__cs__ I should have gotten it so they could have won .
__cs__ They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
__cs__ I &apos;ve failed them .
__cs__ And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
__cs__ And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
__cs__ Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
__cs__ They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
__cs__ They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
__cs__ Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
__cs__ The parents were looking in the window .
__cs__ And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
__cs__ He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
__cs__ And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
__cs__ We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
__cs__ And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
__cs__ Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
__cs__ Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
__cs__ Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
__cs__ Every game we play is different .
__cs__ Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
__cs__ Some games are more about warfare .
__cs__ But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
__cs__ I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
__cs__ And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
__cs__ And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
__cs__ If only .
__cs__ And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
__cs__ I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
__cs__ He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
__cs__ His village is near Mogadishu .
__cs__ Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
__cs__ With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .
__cs__ When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
__cs__ He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
__cs__ Maybe a year passes , nothing .
__cs__ One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
__cs__ He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
__cs__ He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
__cs__ He is introduced to this young woman .
__cs__ He eventually gets married .
__cs__ He starts this new life .
__cs__ He has a purpose in life .
__cs__ One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
__cs__ That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber , and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab , a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda .
__cs__ So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ?
__cs__ He was waiting .
__cs__ He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
__cs__ This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
__cs__ And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
__cs__ It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .
__cs__ For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .
__cs__ Often it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
__cs__ By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
__cs__ If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 .
__cs__ And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
__cs__ 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
__cs__ They pretty much do nothing .
__cs__ I went back to Mogadishu last month , and I went to visit Madina Hospital , the hospital I was born in .
__cs__ I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
__cs__ What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood ?
__cs__ Would I have become a terrorist ?
__cs__ I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
__cs__ My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .
__cs__ I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
__cs__ We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
__cs__ One of the young men in the room was Aden .
__cs__ He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
__cs__ There were no jobs , no opportunities .
__cs__ I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
__cs__ They sought people like him out .
__cs__ But his story takes a different route .
__cs__ In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
__cs__ Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around .
__cs__ Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
__cs__ He started a motorbike company .
__cs__ He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
__cs__ He bought 10 bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
__cs__ How is this story different ?
__cs__ What makes his story different ?
__cs__ I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
__cs__ It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
__cs__ It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
__cs__ And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
__cs__ I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .
__cs__ He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
__cs__ He &apos;s actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mohamed came along , if you wanted flowers at your wedding , you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad .
__cs__ If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
__cs__ for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
__cs__ He started a landscaping and design floral company .
__cs__ He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate .
__cs__ And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
__cs__ There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
__cs__ He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
__cs__ And he doesn &apos;t grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
__cs__ So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
__cs__ They had never really thought about starting up a business .
__cs__ They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
__cs__ He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
__cs__ He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
__cs__ By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
__cs__ They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
__cs__ So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
__cs__ They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
__cs__ Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
__cs__ For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
__cs__ It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
__cs__ Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
__cs__ I believe he is selling hope .
__cs__ His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
__cs__ Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him .
__cs__ He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
__cs__ These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
__cs__ So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
__cs__ I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
__cs__ So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
__cs__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Burniss Travis on the bass , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano . ( Applause )
__cs__ So the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
__cs__ It is really a sacred space .
__cs__ And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
__cs__ You really are alive right here in this moment .
__cs__ There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand .
__cs__ We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
__cs__ In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Titi Boom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
__cs__ Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
__cs__ You have no time for projected ideas .
__cs__ So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
__cs__ So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the bandstand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
__cs__ The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
__cs__ Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
__cs__ So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
__cs__ So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a palette , that sounded like this ...
__cs__ ( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F. ( Music )
__cs__ See , these are all right inside of the color palette .
__cs__ If you played an E.
__cs__ See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
__cs__ If you played an F # though , ( Dissonance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
__cs__ So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
__cs__ And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
__cs__ And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
__cs__ And we won &apos;t react to it .
__cs__ He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
__cs__ We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
__cs__ ( Music ) So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake .
__cs__ The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
__cs__ It was an opportunity that was missed .
__cs__ So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this palette again .
__cs__ He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
__cs__ We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
__cs__ ( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
__cs__ I ended up creating a melody out of it .
__cs__ The texture changed in the drums this time .
__cs__ It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
__cs__ So there is no mistake .
__cs__ The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
__cs__ So jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
__cs__ It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
__cs__ And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
__cs__ We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
__cs__ So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
__cs__ Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
__cs__ And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t micromanage in jazz .
__cs__ You have some people who do .
__cs__ But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
__cs__ If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
__cs__ ready , just play some time .
__cs__ One , two , one , two , three , four .
__cs__ ( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
__cs__ I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
__cs__ This is a science of listening .
__cs__ It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
__cs__ So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
__cs__ When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
__cs__ Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
__cs__ ( Music ) Totally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
__cs__ It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
__cs__ It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
__cs__ It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__cs__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
__cs__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__cs__ Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
__cs__ And I &apos;ll quote three people : Vannevar Bush , Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee .
__cs__ So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
__cs__ This is Vannevar Bush .
__cs__ Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war .
__cs__ And in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly .
__cs__ And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
__cs__ We don &apos;t work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth .
__cs__ The brain works by association .
__cs__ With one item in its thought , it snaps instantly to the next item .
__cs__ And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process .
__cs__ And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the memex .
__cs__ And the memex would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
__cs__ Now this was in 1945 .
__cs__ A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
__cs__ And nobody knew anything about it .
__cs__ So this was before the computer was invented .
__cs__ And he proposed this machine called the memex .
__cs__ And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
__cs__ So spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart , and he was a U.S. Air Force officer .
__cs__ And he was reading it in their library in the Far East .
__cs__ And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
__cs__ And by the mid-60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
__cs__ He built a system .
__cs__ The system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called .
__cs__ And in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called NLS for oN-Line System .
__cs__ And this is Doug Engelbart .
__cs__ He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968 .
__cs__ What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstrated this system .
__cs__ He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
__cs__ And he works this system .
__cs__ And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
__cs__ And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
__cs__ So this is where the mouse came from as well .
__cs__ So this is Doug Engelbart .
__cs__ The trouble with Doug Engelbart &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
__cs__ So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
__cs__ But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
__cs__ And my company , OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh .
__cs__ And we delivered the world &apos;s first hypertext system .
__cs__ And this began to get a head of steam .
__cs__ Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard , and they made a bit of a fuss about it .
__cs__ They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .
__cs__ The magazines started to cover it .
__cs__ Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext .
__cs__ We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version .
__cs__ And our PC version became quite mature .
__cs__ These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
__cs__ You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
__cs__ We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html .
__cs__ We called it hml : hypertext markup language .
__cs__ And the system was capable of doing very , very large documentation systems over computer networks .
__cs__ So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990 .
__cs__ And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you Ian Ritchie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web .
__cs__ And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
__cs__ But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day .
__cs__ And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything ; it was just plain text .
__cs__ I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CERN , he &apos;s not going to do this .
__cs__ So we didn &apos;t do it .
__cs__ In the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
__cs__ In 1992 , his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .
__cs__ In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web .
__cs__ And I saw it , and I thought , yep , that &apos;s it .
__cs__ And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in Edinburgh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker .
__cs__ So that puts me in pretty illustrious company .
__cs__ There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles .
__cs__ There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
__cs__ And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling &apos;s Harry Potter , I guess .
__cs__ On the other hand , there &apos;s Marc Andreessen who wrote the world &apos;s first browser for the World Wide Web .
__cs__ And according to Fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
__cs__ But is he happy ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
__cs__ But there &apos;s no agenda .
__cs__ I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
__cs__ And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
__cs__ And a well-run meeting can yield really positive , actionable results .
__cs__ Actually , I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic .
__cs__ And everybody leaves very angry .
__cs__ It &apos;s kind of funny .
__cs__ ( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
__cs__ Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
__cs__ It &apos;s close to about a million right now .
__cs__ &quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
__cs__ &quot; This is my life . &quot;
__cs__ But the truth is , we &apos;re not powerless at all .
__cs__ In fact , the cure for MAS is right here in our hands .
__cs__ It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No MAS !
__cs__ And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it .
__cs__ People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
__cs__ Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with .
__cs__ People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours .
__cs__ ( Applause ) .
__cs__ And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
__cs__ Some people think that there &apos;s a TED Talk formula : &quot; Give a talk on a round , red rug . &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Share a childhood story . &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Divulge a personal secret . &quot;
__cs__ &quot; End with an inspiring call to action . &quot;
__cs__ No .
__cs__ That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
__cs__ In fact , if you overuse those devices , you &apos;re just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative .
__cs__ But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a ringside seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers , like these .
__cs__ I &apos;ve helped them prepare their talks for prime time , and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk .
__cs__ And even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different , they actually do have one key common ingredient .
__cs__ And it &apos;s this : Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners &apos; minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
__cs__ Let me show you what I mean .
__cs__ Here &apos;s Haley .
__cs__ She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly , she &apos;s terrified .
__cs__ ( Video ) Presenter : Haley Van Dyck !
__cs__ ( Applause ) Over the course of 18 minutes , 1,200 people , many of whom have never seen each other before , are finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley &apos;s brain and with each other .
__cs__ They &apos;re literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns .
__cs__ And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
__cs__ There &apos;s something even more startling happening .
__cs__ Let &apos;s take a look inside Haley &apos;s brain for a moment .
__cs__ There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle .
__cs__ But look here , right here — a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea .
__cs__ And incredibly , this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
__cs__ That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds , just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .
__cs__ But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
__cs__ Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
__cs__ Ideas come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic .
__cs__ Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
__cs__ Sir Ken Robinson — creativity is key to our kids &apos; future .
__cs__ ( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
__cs__ Chris Anderson : Elora Hardy — building from bamboo is beautiful .
__cs__ ( Video ) Elora Hardy : It is growing all around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s elegant , it &apos;s earthquake-resistant .
__cs__ CA : Chimamanda Adichie — people are more than a single identity .
__cs__ ( Video ) Chimamanda Adichie : The single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
__cs__ CA : Your mind is teeming with ideas , and not just randomly .
__cs__ They &apos;re carefully linked together .
__cs__ Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview .
__cs__ It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
__cs__ It &apos;s how you navigate the world .
__cs__ And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
__cs__ So , for example , if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react like this .
__cs__ But if another component of your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react a little bit differently .
__cs__ So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial .
__cs__ You need them to be as reliable as possible — a guide , to the scary but wonderful real world out there .
__cs__ Now , different people &apos;s worldviews can be dramatically different .
__cs__ For example , how does your worldview react when you see this image : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you look at me ?
__cs__ &quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an expert , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
__cs__ Or &quot; &quot; oppressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brainwashed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; ?
__cs__ CA : Whatever your answer , there are millions of people out there who would react very differently .
__cs__ So that &apos;s why ideas really matter .
__cs__ If communicated properly , they &apos;re capable of changing , forever , how someone thinks about the world , and shaping their actions both now and well into the future .
__cs__ Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
__cs__ So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience , here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task : One , limit your talk to just one major idea .
__cs__ Ideas are complex things ; you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you &apos;re most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
__cs__ You have to give context , share examples , make it vivid .
__cs__ So pick one idea , and make it the through-line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
__cs__ Two , give your listeners a reason to care .
__cs__ Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
__cs__ And the main tool to achieve that ?
__cs__ Curiosity .
__cs__ Stir your audience &apos;s curiosity .
__cs__ Use intriguing , provocative questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs explaining .
__cs__ If you can reveal a disconnection in someone &apos;s worldview , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
__cs__ And once you &apos;ve sparked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
__cs__ Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
__cs__ You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners &apos; minds — but not your language , their language .
__cs__ You start where they are .
__cs__ The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences .
__cs__ Now , metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listener already understands .
__cs__ For example , when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word processor to edit DNA .
__cs__ CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds .
__cs__ It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
__cs__ Four , here &apos;s the final tip : Make your idea worth sharing .
__cs__ By that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Who does this idea benefit ? &quot;
__cs__ And I need you to be honest with the answer .
__cs__ If the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
__cs__ The audience will see right through you .
__cs__ But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently , then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk , one that can be a gift to them and to all of us .
__cs__ Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
__cs__ So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
__cs__ I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
__cs__ I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
__cs__ So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
__cs__ I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
__cs__ And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
__cs__ To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
__cs__ One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
__cs__ For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
__cs__ This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
__cs__ This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
__cs__ This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
__cs__ all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
__cs__ So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
__cs__ So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
__cs__ One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
__cs__ You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
__cs__ Students lack perseverance .
__cs__ They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
__cs__ There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
__cs__ And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
__cs__ This is really destructive .
__cs__ David Milch , creator of &quot; &quot; Deadwood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
__cs__ He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
__cs__ He called it , &quot; &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
__cs__ You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
__cs__ And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
__cs__ I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
__cs__ I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
__cs__ I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
__cs__ It applies equally to math .
__cs__ Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
__cs__ I believe in real life .
__cs__ And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
__cs__ I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
__cs__ And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
__cs__ When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
__cs__ And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
__cs__ You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
__cs__ So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
__cs__ Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
__cs__ It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
__cs__ But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
__cs__ I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
__cs__ You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
__cs__ You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
__cs__ So I hope you can see .
__cs__ I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
__cs__ That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
__cs__ So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
__cs__ So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
__cs__ And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
__cs__ So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
__cs__ And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
__cs__ And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
__cs__ And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
__cs__ And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
__cs__ The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
__cs__ And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
__cs__ But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
__cs__ Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
__cs__ It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
__cs__ And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
__cs__ He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
__cs__ So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
__cs__ And here &apos;s how it works .
__cs__ I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
__cs__ The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
__cs__ First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
__cs__ Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
__cs__ And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
__cs__ None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
__cs__ Students need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
__cs__ Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
__cs__ So now we have a water tank .
__cs__ How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
__cs__ And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
__cs__ So now we have the real deal .
__cs__ How long will it take it to fill it up ?
__cs__ And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
__cs__ And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
__cs__ It &apos;s tedious .
__cs__ Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
__cs__ And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids — because of my inexperience — I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
__cs__ And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
__cs__ But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
__cs__ Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
__cs__ We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
__cs__ And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
__cs__ And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
__cs__ We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
__cs__ But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
__cs__ So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
__cs__ These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
__cs__ We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
__cs__ We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
__cs__ This has been a lot of fun .
__cs__ I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
__cs__ And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
__cs__ It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
__cs__ I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
__cs__ I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
__cs__ Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , wow .
__cs__ I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
__cs__ And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Morning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
__cs__ And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
__cs__ Math makes sense of the world .
__cs__ Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
__cs__ So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
__cs__ We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you . ( Applause )
__cs__ Interpreter : Piano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my favorite musical symbol .
__cs__ It means to play softly .
__cs__ If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the score , you need to play softer .
__cs__ Two p &apos;s — even softer .
__cs__ Four p &apos;s — extremely soft .
__cs__ This is my drawing of a p-tree , which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never reach complete silence .
__cs__ That &apos;s my current definition of silence : a very obscure sound .
__cs__ I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language , ASL , plus a bit of my own background .
__cs__ French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s , and as time went by , mixed with local signs , it evolved into the language we know today as ASL .
__cs__ So it has a history of about 200 years .
__cs__ I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
__cs__ And I believed it to be true .
__cs__ Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
__cs__ Sound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .
__cs__ As a Deaf person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a foreign country , blindly following its rules , customs , behaviors and norms without ever questioning them .
__cs__ So how is it that I understand sound ?
__cs__ Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
__cs__ You people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound .
__cs__ I learn and mirror that behavior .
__cs__ At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respond to me .
__cs__ Thus I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
__cs__ &quot; Don &apos;t slam the door ! &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the potato-chip bag ! &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t burp , and when you &apos;re eating , make sure you don &apos;t scrape your utensils on the plate . &quot; &quot; All of these things I term &quot; &quot; sound etiquette . &quot; &quot; Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does .
__cs__ I &apos;m hyper-vigilant around sound .
__cs__ And I &apos;m always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next .
__cs__ Hence , this drawing .
__cs__ TBD , to be decided .
__cs__ TBC , to be continued .
__cs__ TBA , to be announced .
__cs__ And you notice the staff — there are no notes contained in the lines .
__cs__ That &apos;s because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears .
__cs__ In Deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
__cs__ This is a sign for &quot; &quot; staff &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__cs__ A typical staff contains five lines .
__cs__ Yet for me , signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural .
__cs__ That &apos;s why you &apos;ll notice in my drawings , I stick to four lines on paper .
__cs__ In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist residency there .
__cs__ Prior to this time , I had been working as a painter .
__cs__ During this summer , I visited different museums and gallery spaces , and as I went from one place to the next , I noticed there was no visual art there .
__cs__ At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ...
__cs__ there was no visual art , everything was auditory .
__cs__ Now sound has come into my art territory .
__cs__ Is it going to further distance me from art ?
__cs__ I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
__cs__ I actually know sound .
__cs__ I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears .
__cs__ It could be felt tactually , or experienced as a visual , or even as an idea .
__cs__ So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .
__cs__ And everything that I had been taught regarding sound , I decided to do away with and unlearn .
__cs__ I started creating a new body of work .
__cs__ And when I presented this to the art community , I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received .
__cs__ I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social currency .
__cs__ In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing .
__cs__ And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork , or it could empower me .
__cs__ I chose to be empowered .
__cs__ There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .
__cs__ And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
__cs__ So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice .
__cs__ And that way , I &apos;m able to maintain relevancy in society today .
__cs__ So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different ASL interpreters .
__cs__ And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
__cs__ They help me to be heard .
__cs__ And their voices hold value and currency .
__cs__ Ironically , by borrowing out their voices , I &apos;m able to maintain a temporary form of currency , kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate .
__cs__ If I didn &apos;t continue this practice , I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency .
__cs__ So with sound as my new art medium , I delved into the world of music .
__cs__ And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL .
__cs__ For example , a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper .
__cs__ And the same holds true for a concept in ASL .
__cs__ They &apos;re both highly spatial and highly inflected — meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds .
__cs__ I &apos;d like to share with you a piano metaphor , to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works .
__cs__ So , envision a piano .
__cs__ ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
__cs__ If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano — such as facial expression , body movement , speed , hand shape and so on , as you play the piano — English is a linear language , as if one key is being pressed at a time .
__cs__ However , ASL is more like a chord — all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL .
__cs__ If just one of those keys were to change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
__cs__ The same applies to music in regards to pitch , tone and volume .
__cs__ In ASL , by playing around with these different grammatical parameters , you can express different ideas .
__cs__ For example , take the sign TO-LOOK-AT .
__cs__ This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT .
__cs__ I &apos;m looking at you .
__cs__ Staring at you .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — busted . ( Laughter )
__cs__ Uh-oh .
__cs__ What are you looking at ?
__cs__ Aw , stop .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens ? &quot;
__cs__ If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
__cs__ For example , this is the sign for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun rises and sets .
__cs__ This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to repeat it and slow it down , visually it looks like a piece of music .
__cs__ All ... day .
__cs__ I feel the same holds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
__cs__ This is ALL-NIGHT , represented in this drawing .
__cs__ And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; overnight , &quot; ( Sings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two . ( Laughter )
__cs__ This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time .
__cs__ For example , 1H is one hand , 2H is two hand , present tense happens closest and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back .
__cs__ So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Then &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) &quot; Common time &quot; is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure .
__cs__ Yet when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what automatically comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So notice RH : right hand , LH : left hand .
__cs__ We have the staff across the head and the chest .
__cs__ &#91; Head : RH , Flash claw &#93; &#91; Common time &#93; &#91; Chest : LH , Flash claw &#93; I &apos;m now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the &quot; &quot; flash claw . &quot; &quot; Can you please follow along with me ?
__cs__ Everybody , hands up .
__cs__ Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the chest , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time .
__cs__ Yes , got it .
__cs__ That means &quot; &quot; to fall in love &quot; &quot; in International &#91; Sign &#93; .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) International &#91; Sign &#93; , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world .
__cs__ The second one I &apos;d like to demonstrate is this — please follow along with me again .
__cs__ And now this .
__cs__ This is &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Now the third — please follow along again .
__cs__ And again .
__cs__ This is &quot; &quot; enlightenment &quot; &quot; in ASL .
__cs__ So let &apos;s do all three together .
__cs__ &quot; Fall in love , &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; and &quot; &quot; enlightenment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Notice how all three signs are very similar , they all happen at the head and the chest , but they convey quite different meanings .
__cs__ So it &apos;s amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving , just like music is .
__cs__ However , in this day and age , we live in a very audio-centric world .
__cs__ And just because ASL has no sound to it , it automatically holds no social currency .
__cs__ We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency — without sound .
__cs__ And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
__cs__ And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be deaf to learn ASL , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music .
__cs__ ASL is such a rich treasure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
__cs__ And I &apos;d like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language .
__cs__ And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Thank you .
__cs__ Denise Kahler-Braaten : Hey , that &apos;s me .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
__cs__ It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
__cs__ It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
__cs__ So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
__cs__ Sort of an interesting thing .
__cs__ It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
__cs__ And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
__cs__ You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
__cs__ In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
__cs__ And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
__cs__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
__cs__ I actually went to see this one .
__cs__ There was a lot of people there .
__cs__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
__cs__ I was born and raised in North Korea .
__cs__ Although my family constantly struggled against poverty , I was always loved and cared for first , because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family .
__cs__ But then the great famine began in 1994 .
__cs__ I was four years old .
__cs__ My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
__cs__ I would wander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
__cs__ Hunger is humiliation . Hunger is hopelessness .
__cs__ For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
__cs__ On my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
__cs__ But even as a child , I could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
__cs__ Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
__cs__ I saw my father wither away and die .
__cs__ In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
__cs__ Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hug when she left .
__cs__ It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
__cs__ But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long goodbye .
__cs__ I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
__cs__ Suddenly , I became an orphan and homeless .
__cs__ My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
__cs__ My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
__cs__ But that is no way to survive .
__cs__ I started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
__cs__ So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
__cs__ Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
__cs__ Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
__cs__ I was not uncommon .
__cs__ Many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
__cs__ When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , I hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
__cs__ That hope kept me alive .
__cs__ I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
__cs__ I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
__cs__ But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
__cs__ Hope kept me alive .
__cs__ Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
__cs__ After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
__cs__ I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
__cs__ I knew the journey would be risky , but I would be risking my life either way .
__cs__ I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China .
__cs__ I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
__cs__ North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
__cs__ Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans , where they face severe punishment .
__cs__ I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
__cs__ I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
__cs__ I was 16 years old .
__cs__ I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
__cs__ I thought more people would help me .
__cs__ But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
__cs__ I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
__cs__ By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
__cs__ Later that year , an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
__cs__ I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
__cs__ Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And I barely finished elementary school .
__cs__ And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
__cs__ Textbooks and the library were not my playground .
__cs__ My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
__cs__ At one point , my father gave up on me .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
__cs__ But nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
__cs__ So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
__cs__ I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
__cs__ I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
__cs__ But one day , I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
__cs__ And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
__cs__ When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
__cs__ I was so happy .
__cs__ I looked at him sitting next to me .
__cs__ He just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
__cs__ Suddenly I remembered my biological father .
__cs__ My foster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
__cs__ I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of starvation .
__cs__ My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
__cs__ And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
__cs__ I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic award for excellence , and made dean &apos;s list from the first semester in high school .
__cs__ ( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Hope is personal . Hope is something that no one can give to you .
__cs__ You have to choose to believe in hope .
__cs__ You have to make it yourself .
__cs__ In North Korea , I made it myself .
__cs__ Hope brought me to America .
__cs__ But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhelming freedom .
__cs__ My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
__cs__ I did not come here by myself .
__cs__ I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
__cs__ Many people helped me along the way to get here .
__cs__ North Koreans are fighting hard to survive .
__cs__ They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
__cs__ This is my message to you .
__cs__ Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
__cs__ Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
__cs__ My foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
__cs__ In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
__cs__ A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
__cs__ But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Adrian Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
__cs__ I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
__cs__ Joseph Kim : In Korean ?
__cs__ AH : You can do English , then Korean as well .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) JK : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don &apos;t think I can make it without tearing up .
__cs__ Nuna , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
__cs__ I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
__cs__ And I — oh , gosh .
__cs__ I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
__cs__ I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
__cs__ And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
__cs__ AH : Sure , please .
__cs__ JK : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
__cs__ I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
__cs__ How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
__cs__ Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
__cs__ That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
__cs__ And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
__cs__ The reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
__cs__ So for example , in the case of Ticketmaster , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
__cs__ CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
__cs__ And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
__cs__ So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
__cs__ The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
__cs__ But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
__cs__ Text : &quot; &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
__cs__ This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
__cs__ Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
__cs__ This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
__cs__ And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
__cs__ So let me tell you what this project started .
__cs__ So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
__cs__ When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
__cs__ I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
__cs__ But then I started feeling bad .
__cs__ See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
__cs__ And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs .
__cs__ So then I started feeling bad .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
__cs__ But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
__cs__ So see , here &apos;s the thing .
__cs__ While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
__cs__ Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
__cs__ So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
__cs__ Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
__cs__ And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
__cs__ So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
__cs__ So let me explain how this works .
__cs__ So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
__cs__ Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
__cs__ Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
__cs__ Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
__cs__ You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
__cs__ Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
__cs__ It gives you an image for every page of the book .
__cs__ This is an image with text for every page of the book .
__cs__ The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
__cs__ That &apos;s using a technology called OCR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
__cs__ Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
__cs__ Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
__cs__ For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
__cs__ So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
__cs__ So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
__cs__ And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
__cs__ But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
__cs__ So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
__cs__ We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
__cs__ And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
__cs__ And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
__cs__ So this is how the system works .
__cs__ And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
__cs__ So for example , Ticketmaster .
__cs__ So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
__cs__ Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
__cs__ Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
__cs__ And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
__cs__ It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
__cs__ And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
__cs__ And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
__cs__ So funny things can happen .
__cs__ For example , we presented this word .
__cs__ It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christians &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
__cs__ But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
__cs__ So we get this . ( Text : bad christians ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Oops . ( Laughter )
__cs__ Here &apos;s another really bad one .
__cs__ JohnEdwards.com ( Text : Damn liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
__cs__ Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
__cs__ See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
__cs__ So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
__cs__ I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
__cs__ Here &apos;s how it works .
__cs__ Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA . ( Text : invisible toaster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
__cs__ Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
__cs__ But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
__cs__ There are tens of thousands of these .
__cs__ Some of them are very cute . ( Text : clenched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are funnier .
__cs__ ( Text : stoned founders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg . ( Laughter )
__cs__ Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
__cs__ So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
__cs__ This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA : 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
__cs__ And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
__cs__ So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically — like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
__cs__ It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
__cs__ And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
__cs__ But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
__cs__ So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
__cs__ So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
__cs__ Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
__cs__ This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
__cs__ It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
__cs__ Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
__cs__ So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
__cs__ It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Severin Hacker .
__cs__ Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
__cs__ So I posed the question to my graduate student .
__cs__ By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
__cs__ So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
__cs__ Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
__cs__ First of all , translating the Web .
__cs__ So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
__cs__ A large fraction of it is in English .
__cs__ If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
__cs__ But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
__cs__ So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
__cs__ So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
__cs__ Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
__cs__ Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
__cs__ Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
__cs__ Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
__cs__ Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
__cs__ It makes a lot of mistakes .
__cs__ Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
__cs__ So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
__cs__ Actually it was a forum post .
__cs__ It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
__cs__ It was translated from Japanese into English .
__cs__ So I &apos;ll just let you read .
__cs__ This person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
__cs__ So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
__cs__ So he &apos;s just explaining something .
__cs__ Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
__cs__ ( Text : At often , the goat-time install a error is vomit . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
__cs__ ( Text : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the dragon ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
__cs__ ( Text : This insult to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
__cs__ ( Text : Please apologize for your stupidity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
__cs__ So back to the question .
__cs__ So we need people to translate the whole Web .
__cs__ So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
__cs__ We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
__cs__ We could do that .
__cs__ Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
__cs__ For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
__cs__ Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
__cs__ It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
__cs__ If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
__cs__ So it would be very expensive .
__cs__ So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
__cs__ Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
__cs__ The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
__cs__ So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
__cs__ That &apos;s a big problem .
__cs__ The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
__cs__ How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
__cs__ Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
__cs__ So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
__cs__ Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
__cs__ But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
__cs__ There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
__cs__ And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals , and that is language education .
__cs__ So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
__cs__ People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
__cs__ And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
__cs__ For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
__cs__ So people really , really want to learn a new language .
__cs__ So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Duolingo — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
__cs__ And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
__cs__ So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
__cs__ There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
__cs__ We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
__cs__ And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
__cs__ And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
__cs__ But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
__cs__ Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
__cs__ First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
__cs__ We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
__cs__ People really can learn a language with it .
__cs__ And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
__cs__ So people really do learn a language .
__cs__ And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
__cs__ Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
__cs__ As opposed to learning with made-up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
__cs__ So people really do learn a language .
__cs__ But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
__cs__ So let me show you one example .
__cs__ This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
__cs__ The top is the German .
__cs__ The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
__cs__ And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
__cs__ You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
__cs__ Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
__cs__ We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
__cs__ Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
__cs__ So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
__cs__ Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
__cs__ So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
__cs__ And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
__cs__ Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
__cs__ Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
__cs__ So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
__cs__ The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
__cs__ So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
__cs__ This is totally biased towards the rich .
__cs__ Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
__cs__ So this is how we could monetize this .
__cs__ Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
__cs__ But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
__cs__ So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
__cs__ So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
__cs__ We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
__cs__ We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
__cs__ By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
__cs__ So thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart .
__cs__ And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
__cs__ And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians .
__cs__ She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
__cs__ And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
__cs__ But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
__cs__ The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
__cs__ Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
__cs__ So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
__cs__ Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
__cs__ In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize .
__cs__ And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
__cs__ Now , she had no idea what to look for .
__cs__ This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
__cs__ Had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
__cs__ Had they consumed colored drinks ?
__cs__ Did they eat fish and chips ?
__cs__ Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
__cs__ What time of life had they started school ?
__cs__ And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
__cs__ By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant .
__cs__ Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
__cs__ Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
__cs__ It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
__cs__ And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
__cs__ Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 .
__cs__ People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
__cs__ In fact , she need not have hurried .
__cs__ It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women .
__cs__ The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
__cs__ A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
__cs__ Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
__cs__ So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
__cs__ So , how did she know that she was right ?
__cs__ Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
__cs__ She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn &apos;t .
__cs__ So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse .
__cs__ Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
__cs__ George frankly preferred numbers to people .
__cs__ But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . &quot; &quot; He actively sought disconfirmation .
__cs__ Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
__cs__ He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
__cs__ Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
__cs__ It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t echo chambers .
__cs__ I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
__cs__ Alice and George were very good at conflict .
__cs__ They saw it as thinking .
__cs__ So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
__cs__ Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
__cs__ That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
__cs__ That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
__cs__ And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
__cs__ Because you simply won &apos;t commit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
__cs__ And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
__cs__ Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
__cs__ But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
__cs__ So how do organizations think ?
__cs__ Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
__cs__ And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
__cs__ And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
__cs__ In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
__cs__ Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
__cs__ Eighty-five percent is a really big number .
__cs__ It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and Alice so triumphantly did .
__cs__ They can &apos;t think together .
__cs__ And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
__cs__ So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
__cs__ Because it does take skill and practice , too .
__cs__ If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
__cs__ So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
__cs__ And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
__cs__ He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
__cs__ He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
__cs__ But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
__cs__ So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
__cs__ After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
__cs__ Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
__cs__ But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
__cs__ In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns .
__cs__ And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
__cs__ It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
__cs__ So now Joe had allies . They could think together .
__cs__ And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
__cs__ Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he wasn &apos;t a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
__cs__ But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
__cs__ And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
__cs__ And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
__cs__ They think of him as a leader .
__cs__ So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
__cs__ Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they &apos;re prepared to defend .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
__cs__ I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
__cs__ I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
__cs__ The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
__cs__ It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
__cs__ But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
__cs__ Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
__cs__ But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
__cs__ Openness isn &apos;t the end .
__cs__ It &apos;s the beginning .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania .
__cs__ I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
__cs__ It was a simple machine that changed my life .
__cs__ Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
__cs__ I had never used a computer .
__cs__ I had never seen an Internet .
__cs__ On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
__cs__ My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )
__cs__ There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
__cs__ But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
__cs__ I would like to share that story today .
__cs__ We have seven children in my family .
__cs__ All sisters , excepting me .
__cs__ This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
__cs__ Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
__cs__ Like everyone else , we grew maize .
__cs__ One year our fortune turned very bad .
__cs__ In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
__cs__ Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
__cs__ My family ate one meal per day , at night .
__cs__ Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
__cs__ The food passes through our bodies .
__cs__ We drop down to nothing .
__cs__ In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
__cs__ Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
__cs__ I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
__cs__ It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
__cs__ I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
__cs__ So I went to a library .
__cs__ I read books , science books , especially physics .
__cs__ I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
__cs__ I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
__cs__ Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
__cs__ It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
__cs__ Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
__cs__ So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
__cs__ But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
__cs__ Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
__cs__ Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
__cs__ It was one light at first .
__cs__ And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
__cs__ Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
__cs__ Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
__cs__ ( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
__cs__ I had never seen an airplane before .
__cs__ I had never slept in a hotel .
__cs__ So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
__cs__ So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
__cs__ God bless .
__cs__ Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
__cs__ I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
__cs__ Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
__cs__ You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
__cs__ And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
__cs__ If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
__cs__ And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
__cs__ We would never do that in our own countries .
__cs__ But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
__cs__ This is happening to us today .
__cs__ And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
__cs__ And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
__cs__ And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
__cs__ If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
__cs__ We have three main groups .
__cs__ We have online criminals .
__cs__ Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
__cs__ And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
__cs__ These guys make money .
__cs__ They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
__cs__ We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
__cs__ Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
__cs__ This is Alfred Gonzalez .
__cs__ This is Stephen Watt .
__cs__ This is Bjorn Sundin .
__cs__ This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
__cs__ These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
__cs__ The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
__cs__ Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
__cs__ And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
__cs__ And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
__cs__ In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
__cs__ The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
__cs__ They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
__cs__ Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
__cs__ So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
__cs__ And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
__cs__ This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
__cs__ DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
__cs__ It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
__cs__ Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
__cs__ And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
__cs__ And his answer was yes .
__cs__ So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
__cs__ Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
__cs__ They sell certificates .
__cs__ What do you do with certificates ?
__cs__ Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
__cs__ Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
__cs__ Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
__cs__ and issue rogue certificates .
__cs__ And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
__cs__ What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
__cs__ Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
__cs__ Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
__cs__ They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
__cs__ The company headquarters are right here .
__cs__ So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
__cs__ But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
__cs__ For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
__cs__ If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
__cs__ But today , it goes beyond that .
__cs__ They will tap your Internet connection .
__cs__ They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
__cs__ Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
__cs__ Why should I worry ?
__cs__ Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
__cs__ Privacy is implied .
__cs__ Privacy is not up for discussion .
__cs__ This is not a question between privacy against security .
__cs__ It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
__cs__ And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
__cs__ And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
__cs__ And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
__cs__ We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
__cs__ It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
__cs__ This , for example , is my tumble dryer .
__cs__ Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__cs__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__cs__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__cs__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__cs__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__cs__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__cs__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__cs__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__cs__ But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
__cs__ Values are a certain kind of fact .
__cs__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__cs__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__cs__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__cs__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__cs__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__cs__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__cs__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__cs__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__cs__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__cs__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
__cs__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__cs__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__cs__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__cs__ Probably not .
__cs__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__cs__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__cs__ And morality relates to these truths .
__cs__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__cs__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__cs__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__cs__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__cs__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__cs__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__cs__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__cs__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__cs__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__cs__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__cs__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__cs__ And these await our discovery .
__cs__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__cs__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__cs__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__cs__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__cs__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__cs__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
__cs__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__cs__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__cs__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__cs__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__cs__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__cs__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__cs__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
__cs__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__cs__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__cs__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__cs__ As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
__cs__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__cs__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__cs__ There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__cs__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
__cs__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__cs__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__cs__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__cs__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__cs__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__cs__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__cs__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__cs__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
__cs__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__cs__ Why would we think this ?
__cs__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__cs__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__cs__ But it clearly admits some exceptions .
__cs__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__cs__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__cs__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__cs__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__cs__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__cs__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__cs__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__cs__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__cs__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
__cs__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__cs__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
__cs__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__cs__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__cs__ Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__cs__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__cs__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__cs__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__cs__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__cs__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__cs__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__cs__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
__cs__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__cs__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__cs__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__cs__ But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__cs__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__cs__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__cs__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__cs__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__cs__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
__cs__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
__cs__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__cs__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__cs__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__cs__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__cs__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__cs__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
__cs__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__cs__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__cs__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__cs__ But this is just the point .
__cs__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__cs__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__cs__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__cs__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__cs__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__cs__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__cs__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__cs__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__cs__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__cs__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__cs__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__cs__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__cs__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__cs__ It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__cs__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__cs__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__cs__ Thank you very much .
__cs__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
__cs__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__cs__ Language seems to be really important here .
__cs__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__cs__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__cs__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__cs__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
__cs__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__cs__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__cs__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
__cs__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__cs__ But can you reconcile that ?
__cs__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__cs__ Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__cs__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__cs__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__cs__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__cs__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__cs__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__cs__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__cs__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__cs__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__cs__ SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
__cs__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__cs__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__cs__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__cs__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__cs__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__cs__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
__cs__ A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
__cs__ This one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her Broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
__cs__ And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
__cs__ And after a few moments , her therapist tries a new tack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she sings , in one descending scale , she sings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
__cs__ And it &apos;s a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
__cs__ Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug , one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
__cs__ Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .
__cs__ And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere &apos;s damage .
__cs__ When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music ,
__cs__ and how late-stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
__cs__ But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug , and it was this : that I was at a crossroads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
__cs__ I had just completed my undergraduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fallen in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
__cs__ I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes , these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with disfiguring cancers .
__cs__ I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor , that doctor without borders .
__cs__ On the other hand , I had played the violin my entire life .
__cs__ Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
__cs__ It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan , and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv , and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory , but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
__cs__ And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
__cs__ And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic .
__cs__ It was my first audition , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
__cs__ And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra , to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
__cs__ But a year later , I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician .
__cs__ Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard , but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s , was treated with thorazine at Bellevue , and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later .
__cs__ Nathaniel &apos;s story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The Soloist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his violin teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his violin , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
__cs__ And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row , I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
__cs__ Playing for Nathaniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel &apos;s psyche , yet came as a true musical offering from me .
__cs__ I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
__cs__ And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very naive sense , I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill .
__cs__ But in the end , it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
__cs__ There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum .
__cs__ And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel , I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony , bringing the light of music into the very darkest places , performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row , performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder , and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane .
__cs__ After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
__cs__ Suddenly , what we &apos;re finding with these concerts , away from the stage , away from the footlights , out of the tuxedo tails , the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
__cs__ Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
__cs__ Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
__cs__ The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner , or a symphony by Brahms , or chamber music by Beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
__cs__ And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration , the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
__cs__ And the spark of that beauty , the spark of that humanity transforms into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must instill within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire healing from within .
__cs__ I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Keats , the Romantic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
__cs__ Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
__cs__ And Keats said , &quot; &quot; Beauty is truth , and truth beauty .
__cs__ That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
__cs__ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
__cs__ I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
__cs__ I have not slept in weeks .
__cs__ Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
__cs__ Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
__cs__ So I would walk around in a daze during the day .
__cs__ I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
__cs__ In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
__cs__ Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
__cs__ My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
__cs__ And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
__cs__ But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
__cs__ And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
__cs__ Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
__cs__ And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
__cs__ This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
__cs__ How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
__cs__ And so we started talking about this .
__cs__ And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
__cs__ All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
__cs__ But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
__cs__ And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
__cs__ So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
__cs__ And the idea was to put McSweeney &apos;s — McSweeney &apos;s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
__cs__ It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
__cs__ We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
__cs__ So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
__cs__ You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
__cs__ So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this mural , that &apos;s a Chris Ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
__cs__ So we rented this space .
__cs__ And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
__cs__ You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
__cs__ You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
__cs__ It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
__cs__ We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look — while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
__cs__ And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
__cs__ Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
__cs__ You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
__cs__ A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate supply-like .
__cs__ Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
__cs__ We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
__cs__ Up at the top , you see the eyepatch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch , and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mitzvahs and whatever .
__cs__ So we opened this place . And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
__cs__ This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
__cs__ These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Practical Joking with Pirates . &quot;
__cs__ While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
__cs__ That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
__cs__ It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
__cs__ So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
__cs__ The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
__cs__ We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
__cs__ We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
__cs__ I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle .
__cs__ Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
__cs__ It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
__cs__ And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
__cs__ And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
__cs__ And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
__cs__ And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
__cs__ And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari , a longtime San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
__cs__ She took over as executive director .
__cs__ Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
__cs__ And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
__cs__ The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
__cs__ You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
__cs__ And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
__cs__ They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored .
__cs__ So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
__cs__ And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
__cs__ If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
__cs__ But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
__cs__ And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
__cs__ Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
__cs__ First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
__cs__ And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
__cs__ And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
__cs__ And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
__cs__ They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
__cs__ So there &apos;s no stigma .
__cs__ They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
__cs__ They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
__cs__ These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
__cs__ They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
__cs__ There &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at McSweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
__cs__ But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
__cs__ They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
__cs__ They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
__cs__ And that makes a happy family .
__cs__ A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
__cs__ A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
__cs__ So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
__cs__ So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
__cs__ And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster .
__cs__ And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
__cs__ The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
__cs__ So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
__cs__ Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
__cs__ So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
__cs__ This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
__cs__ You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
__cs__ So this is one of the books that they do .
__cs__ Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic . &quot;
__cs__ And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
__cs__ So then we still had more tutors to use .
__cs__ This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
__cs__ The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
__cs__ We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
__cs__ The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
__cs__ The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
__cs__ Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
__cs__ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
__cs__ We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
__cs__ Whoever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
__cs__ The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
__cs__ They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
__cs__ And that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
__cs__ So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
__cs__ Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Everett Middle School Writers &apos; Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
__cs__ It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
__cs__ This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight-Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages — English and Spanish .
__cs__ So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
__cs__ I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
__cs__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
__cs__ She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
__cs__ She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
__cs__ It &apos;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
__cs__ I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
__cs__ We had a big party at the end .
__cs__ This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
__cs__ You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
__cs__ And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
__cs__ Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
__cs__ The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
__cs__ And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
__cs__ It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
__cs__ And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
__cs__ We sell all the student books .
__cs__ Where else would you put them , right ?
__cs__ So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money .
__cs__ So it was paying the rent .
__cs__ And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
__cs__ But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
__cs__ It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
__cs__ There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
__cs__ And it became a gateway to the community .
__cs__ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
__cs__ What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
__cs__ They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
__cs__ And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
__cs__ This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
__cs__ So the store actually did really well .
__cs__ But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
__cs__ It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
__cs__ So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
__cs__ So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
__cs__ And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
__cs__ They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
__cs__ They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
__cs__ So , knowing the crime-fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company .
__cs__ This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
__cs__ And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
__cs__ So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Costco for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
__cs__ These are all handmade .
__cs__ These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
__cs__ All the packaging is done by Sam Potts .
__cs__ So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
__cs__ This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
__cs__ Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
__cs__ Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
__cs__ These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
__cs__ This is a secret identity kit .
__cs__ If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Hoboken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
__cs__ So , this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
__cs__ There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that .
__cs__ So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
__cs__ You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
__cs__ It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
__cs__ But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
__cs__ All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
__cs__ I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
__cs__ It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
__cs__ And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
__cs__ So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
__cs__ It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
__cs__ This is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
__cs__ You can read this quote .
__cs__ Addicted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
__cs__ Came in . Got this concentrated attention .
__cs__ And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
__cs__ So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
__cs__ It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
__cs__ So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
__cs__ He &apos;s now been published in five books .
__cs__ He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super-Has-Beens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Penguin Balboa , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
__cs__ And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
__cs__ He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
__cs__ There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
__cs__ So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
__cs__ This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers .
__cs__ So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-Eleven would be .
__cs__ Leeches . Mammoth chunks . They even have their own Slurpee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Order . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
__cs__ These are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pittsfield , Massachusetts ; Ink Spot in Cincinnati ; Youth Speaks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin Bat Cave in Austin ; Fighting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Roddy Doyle , this will be open in April .
__cs__ Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
__cs__ All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
__cs__ Profound leaps forward !
__cs__ And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
__cs__ I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
__cs__ I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
__cs__ We created a website .
__cs__ I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
__cs__ We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
__cs__ Always let the teachers lead the way .
__cs__ They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
__cs__ There are a million ways .
__cs__ You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
__cs__ So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
__cs__ This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
__cs__ This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
__cs__ Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
__cs__ If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
__cs__ You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
__cs__ And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
__cs__ And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureaucratically untenable .
__cs__ You can do and use the skills that you have .
__cs__ The schools need you . The teachers need you .
__cs__ Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
__cs__ Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
__cs__ You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
__cs__ Thank you so much .
__cs__ ( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
__cs__ And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
__cs__ And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day .
__cs__ And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
__cs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; Hallelujah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
__cs__ ( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
__cs__ My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
__cs__ But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
__cs__ I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
__cs__ And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laughed .
__cs__ And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
__cs__ And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
__cs__ Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
__cs__ My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate , and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay .
__cs__ It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles .
__cs__ That ’ s a big thing in California .
__cs__ And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 71 now .
__cs__ And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
__cs__ And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
__cs__ You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
__cs__ Because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
__cs__ And so I argued with people about that , I argued and I argued .
__cs__ I called my parents up .
__cs__ I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up riding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
__cs__ They ’ re back in Philadelphia .
__cs__ And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mothers are like that .
__cs__ And so , on my 27th birthday I decided , because I argued so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
__cs__ And so I did .
__cs__ I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
__cs__ And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
__cs__ And what I heard , it kind of disturbed me .
__cs__ Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
__cs__ And in my mind , I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still finishing up .
__cs__ And then I would launch in .
__cs__ Well , that just ended communication .
__cs__ So on this first day I actually listened .
__cs__ And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
__cs__ I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
__cs__ I didn ’ t .
__cs__ And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
__cs__ So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
__cs__ Well , that lasted 17 years .
__cs__ Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
__cs__ And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
__cs__ I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
__cs__ It ’ s only 500 miles .
__cs__ And I went into the Registrar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
__cs__ I had a newspaper clipping .
__cs__ &quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
__cs__ You don ’ t … ?
__cs__ We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
__cs__ And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a bachelor ’ s degree .
__cs__ And my father came out , he was so proud .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a bachelor ’ s degree ?
__cs__ You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hunched my shoulder , I picked my backpack up again and I started walking .
__cs__ I walked all the way up to Port Townsend , Washington , where I built a wooden boat , rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; Idaho and down to Missoula , Montana .
__cs__ I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
__cs__ I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
__cs__ There are two stories in Montana .
__cs__ The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
__cs__ And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Register for one credit .
__cs__ You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Rivers and lakes , the hydrological systems , South America .
__cs__ So I did that .
__cs__ He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve registered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can matriculate — you ’ re matriculating , so you can use the library .
__cs__ And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class .
__cs__ They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
__cs__ But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
__cs__ They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
__cs__ And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
__cs__ I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
__cs__ I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Francis , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpreting for me .
__cs__ All the students sat around and they went ...
__cs__ ( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the schedule , to see when they could get out .
__cs__ They had to take that class with me .
__cs__ Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
__cs__ And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
__cs__ and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
__cs__ &quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a handsaw . &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Well , you can ’ t clearcut with a ... &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
__cs__ &quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about selective forestry . &quot;
__cs__ Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
__cs__ I just backed out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fists from flying .
__cs__ But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
__cs__ And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
__cs__ And so I went on .
__cs__ My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start riding and driving and start talking .
__cs__ What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hunched my shoulder , I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin .
__cs__ I spent two years there writing on oil spills .
__cs__ No one was interested in oil spills .
__cs__ But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
__cs__ And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills .
__cs__ My dad came out again .
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
__cs__ My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my backpack again .
__cs__ I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
__cs__ And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anniversary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
__cs__ And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
__cs__ And I ’ m thanking you , and I &apos;m thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak .
__cs__ And that ’ s communication .
__cs__ And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
__cs__ And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
__cs__ Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
__cs__ Well , my journey kept going on .
__cs__ My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
__cs__ I worked for the Coastguard , was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador .
__cs__ I wrote regulations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil spill regulations .
__cs__ 20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
__cs__ &quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
__cs__ He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , buddy . &quot;
__cs__ How could that be , how could that be ?
__cs__ How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
__cs__ Well , my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time .
__cs__ And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean , and walked through all of the islands , and to Venezuela .
__cs__ And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
__cs__ I started talking because I had studied environment .
__cs__ I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this informal level .
__cs__ And the informal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
__cs__ And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
__cs__ Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
__cs__ And so that ’ s the message that I had .
__cs__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sailboat , sailed all the way through the Caribbean — it wasn &apos;t really my sailboat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to Venezuela and I started walking .
__cs__ This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motorized vehicles .
__cs__ I was walking through El Dorado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison — in Venezuela , and I don ’ t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
__cs__ There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; Pasaporte , pasaporte , &quot; &quot; and with an M16 pointed at me .
__cs__ And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Passport , huh ?
__cs__ I don &apos;t need to show you my passport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
__cs__ I &apos;m Dr. Francis ; I &apos;m a U.N. Ambassador and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
__cs__ What possessed me to say this thing ?
__cs__ The road turned into the jungle .
__cs__ I didn ’ t get shot .
__cs__ And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; Free at last — thank God Almighty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
__cs__ It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
__cs__ I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
__cs__ The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles .
__cs__ Now how could that be ?
__cs__ Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
__cs__ But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
__cs__ I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador .
__cs__ I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
__cs__ And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
__cs__ You know , we can do it .
__cs__ I was going to have to change .
__cs__ And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
__cs__ I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
__cs__ I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
__cs__ But I know I needed to .
__cs__ I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
__cs__ And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
__cs__ And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
__cs__ And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
__cs__ We have to change now .
__cs__ As our former Vice President said , we have to become activists .
__cs__ So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
__cs__ And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
__cs__ So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
__cs__ Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
__cs__ So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
__cs__ Thank you .
__cs__ ( Applause )
__cs__ So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
__cs__ And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street .
__cs__ This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
__cs__ Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
__cs__ So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
__cs__ They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
__cs__ Blocks have names .
__cs__ Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
__cs__ All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
__cs__ And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
__cs__ There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
__cs__ The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
__cs__ The second house ever built is house number two .
__cs__ Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
__cs__ So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
__cs__ So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
__cs__ ( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
__cs__ But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
__cs__ So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
__cs__ And this map is also accurate .
__cs__ ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
__cs__ So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
__cs__ Domo arigato gozaimashita .
