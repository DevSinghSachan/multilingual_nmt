__fi__ And you &apos;ll now see the yolk and the white have separated .
__fi__ And slightly more complex things appear .
__fi__ That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
__fi__ And deep beneath those oceans , at cracks in the Earth &apos;s crust , you &apos;ve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
__fi__ But of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
__fi__ This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
__fi__ Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
__fi__ Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
__fi__ So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
__fi__ They kill our livestock .
__fi__ This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
__fi__ My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
__fi__ So I grew up hating lions so much .
__fi__ The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
__fi__ So they kill the lions .
__fi__ It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
__fi__ And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
__fi__ So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
__fi__ So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
__fi__ And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
__fi__ But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
__fi__ So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
__fi__ And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
__fi__ I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
__fi__ But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jumps in and kills the animals .
__fi__ So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
__fi__ And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
__fi__ So I had an idea .
__fi__ Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
__fi__ And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
__fi__ And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
__fi__ So I set up everything .
__fi__ As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
__fi__ And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
__fi__ As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
__fi__ And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
__fi__ The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
__fi__ So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
__fi__ And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
__fi__ One of them was this grandmother .
__fi__ She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
__fi__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
__fi__ Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
__fi__ And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
__fi__ Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
__fi__ My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
__fi__ I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
__fi__ So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
__fi__ And here I am today .
__fi__ I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
__fi__ So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
__fi__ I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
__fi__ Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
__fi__ So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere : Yep .
__fi__ CA : You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
__fi__ What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
__fi__ RT : My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence.CA : Electric fence ?
__fi__ RT : But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) CA : You already tried it once , right , and you — RT : I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock . ( Laughter ) CA : In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
__fi__ We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
__fi__ Thank you so much.RT : Thank you . ( Applause )
__fi__ Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
__fi__ Disappears right into the background .
__fi__ So , he &apos;s bluffing . Let &apos;s do it backwards .
__fi__ One , two , three .
__fi__ You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
__fi__ Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
__fi__ And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
__fi__ We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
__fi__ We go through initiation rites .
__fi__ We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
__fi__ But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
__fi__ And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara — this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
__fi__ All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
__fi__ And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
__fi__ Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
__fi__ And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
__fi__ The ethnosphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
__fi__ It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
__fi__ And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
__fi__ No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
__fi__ And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
__fi__ When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
__fi__ Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
__fi__ A language is a flash of the human spirit .
__fi__ It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
__fi__ Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
__fi__ And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
__fi__ They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
__fi__ What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
__fi__ And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
__fi__ And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
__fi__ Let &apos;s make it Kogi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
__fi__ And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
__fi__ Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
__fi__ Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
__fi__ Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
__fi__ They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
__fi__ And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
__fi__ They simply listen and then begin to speak .
__fi__ Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
__fi__ In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
__fi__ They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
__fi__ They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
__fi__ But the Waorani didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
__fi__ They speared each other .
__fi__ 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
__fi__ We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
__fi__ Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
__fi__ In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
__fi__ In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
__fi__ On the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
__fi__ It &apos;s interesting .
__fi__ If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
__fi__ Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
__fi__ There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
__fi__ But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
__fi__ So , the living give birth to the spirits .
__fi__ The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
__fi__ That &apos;s why the Voodooists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
__fi__ We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be harmed ?
__fi__ So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
__fi__ Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
__fi__ Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
__fi__ In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
__fi__ To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
__fi__ The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
__fi__ And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
__fi__ And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
__fi__ It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; elder brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
__fi__ Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
__fi__ Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; &quot; noble savage , &quot; &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
__fi__ Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
__fi__ There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
__fi__ Now , what does that mean ?
__fi__ It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
__fi__ Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
__fi__ What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
__fi__ I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
__fi__ That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
__fi__ Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
__fi__ It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
__fi__ This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .
__fi__ What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic — to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
__fi__ This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__fi__ If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
__fi__ To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
__fi__ In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes — who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
__fi__ They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
__fi__ Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
__fi__ How , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
__fi__ Well , we use that great euphemism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaningless .
__fi__ But you ask the Indians , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
__fi__ This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
__fi__ And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
__fi__ I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
__fi__ Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting stamens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
__fi__ Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
__fi__ All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
__fi__ And the problem is not technology itself .
__fi__ The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
__fi__ It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
__fi__ Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan — a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
__fi__ to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest — or , in the case of the Yanomami , it &apos;s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
__fi__ Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
__fi__ You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &apos;s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
__fi__ And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
__fi__ I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
__fi__ This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
__fi__ That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
__fi__ His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
__fi__ His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
__fi__ He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
__fi__ The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
__fi__ One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
__fi__ The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
__fi__ And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
__fi__ Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
__fi__ And it &apos;s humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 150,000 &#93; years .
__fi__ The Neolithic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus — is only 10,000 years ago .
__fi__ The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
__fi__ Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
__fi__ When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
__fi__ And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
__fi__ This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
__fi__ The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
__fi__ This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
__fi__ The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
__fi__ Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
__fi__ The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
__fi__ So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
__fi__ He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
__fi__ He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
__fi__ He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
__fi__ Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
__fi__ The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
__fi__ It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .
__fi__ It &apos;s an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
__fi__ An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
__fi__ And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
__fi__ They &apos;re homelands of somebody .
__fi__ They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
__fi__ So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
__fi__ We think that polemics — ( Applause ) — we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
__fi__ 156 nations carry our television channel .
__fi__ Our magazines are read by millions .
__fi__ And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
__fi__ Thank you very much .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
__fi__ I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
__fi__ If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
__fi__ Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
__fi__ Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
__fi__ We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
__fi__ Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
__fi__ So I started planning how to help them escape .
__fi__ I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
__fi__ I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
__fi__ So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
__fi__ When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
__fi__ But my tiger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
__fi__ After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
__fi__ It is not important if I like the job or not .
__fi__ But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
__fi__ That is me playing my imaginary piano .
__fi__ An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
__fi__ I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
__fi__ But no adults liked the idea .
__fi__ No adults believed I was serious .
__fi__ Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
__fi__ So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
__fi__ My dream would never come true .
__fi__ I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
__fi__ But that &apos;s so unfair .
__fi__ So I was determined to find another calling .
__fi__ Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
__fi__ I turned to books .
__fi__ I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
__fi__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &quot; ( aka Echo Chan ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
__fi__ Books banned in China , of course .
__fi__ &quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
__fi__ That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
__fi__ The Bible is interesting , but strange .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
__fi__ But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
__fi__ &quot; &quot; Honor , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
__fi__ Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
__fi__ It offers many insights .
__fi__ For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
__fi__ It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
__fi__ A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
__fi__ Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
__fi__ It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
__fi__ There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
__fi__ Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
__fi__ So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
__fi__ So I started reading books in pairs .
__fi__ So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; by David McCullough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
__fi__ &#91; &quot; &quot; Personal History &quot; &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
__fi__ For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
__fi__ For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty — interesting .
__fi__ So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
__fi__ &#91; &quot; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
__fi__ For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Huh !
__fi__ &quot; &quot; Bride &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; Uh-oh .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
__fi__ I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
__fi__ Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
__fi__ I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
__fi__ Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
__fi__ Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
__fi__ So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
__fi__ So may books be always with you .
__fi__ Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__fi__ The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
__fi__ Guess who was the performing guest ?
__fi__ Susan Boyle .
__fi__ And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hello &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
__fi__ It means &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
__fi__ Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; &quot; green onion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
__fi__ That was hilarious .
__fi__ So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
__fi__ They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
__fi__ And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
__fi__ Well , being different is not that difficult .
__fi__ We are all different from different perspectives .
__fi__ But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
__fi__ You may have the chance to make a difference .
__fi__ My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
__fi__ I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton — it &apos;s still there .
__fi__ So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
__fi__ That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
__fi__ Around the same time , I was going through an audition — the first ever open audition by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
__fi__ The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
__fi__ So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
__fi__ Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of offended them .
__fi__ But actually , they were impressed by my words .
__fi__ And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
__fi__ After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
__fi__ So I was on a national television prime-time show .
__fi__ And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
__fi__ ( Applause ) And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
__fi__ Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
__fi__ So we do a lot of things .
__fi__ I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
__fi__ And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
__fi__ But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
__fi__ I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
__fi__ I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
__fi__ I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
__fi__ But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
__fi__ How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
__fi__ So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
__fi__ First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
__fi__ Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei — 20 years old , beautiful .
__fi__ She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
__fi__ And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
__fi__ She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
__fi__ The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
__fi__ So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
__fi__ All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
__fi__ It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
__fi__ But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
__fi__ It is still boiling .
__fi__ It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
__fi__ And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
__fi__ Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
__fi__ Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
__fi__ On Tencent , 200 million .
__fi__ The most popular blogger — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
__fi__ About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
__fi__ And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
__fi__ But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
__fi__ So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
__fi__ So how are they different ?
__fi__ First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
__fi__ And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
__fi__ That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
__fi__ Most of them have fairly good education .
__fi__ The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
__fi__ In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
__fi__ But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
__fi__ And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
__fi__ So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
__fi__ So making a living is not that easy for young people .
__fi__ College graduates are not in short supply .
__fi__ In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
__fi__ So what do they do ? They have to share space — squeezed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tribe of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
__fi__ That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
__fi__ Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
__fi__ They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
__fi__ Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
__fi__ They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
__fi__ And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
__fi__ Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
__fi__ But they died because of all different personal reasons .
__fi__ But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
__fi__ For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
__fi__ So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
__fi__ These diagrams show a more general social background .
__fi__ The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
__fi__ But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
__fi__ The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
__fi__ Now it &apos;s 0.5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
__fi__ And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
__fi__ And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
__fi__ So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
__fi__ So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
__fi__ Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
__fi__ For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
__fi__ And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
__fi__ Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
__fi__ So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
__fi__ So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
__fi__ Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
__fi__ We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
__fi__ And guess what , we have faked beef .
__fi__ They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
__fi__ And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
__fi__ So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
__fi__ And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
__fi__ While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
__fi__ China is soon to pass the U.S.
__fi__ as the number one market for luxury brands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
__fi__ But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
__fi__ They &apos;re not rich at all .
__fi__ They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
__fi__ And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
__fi__ But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
__fi__ So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; wedding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
__fi__ It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
__fi__ And also , people are doing good through social media .
__fi__ And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
__fi__ People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
__fi__ And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
__fi__ And here also people are helping to find missing children .
__fi__ A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
__fi__ After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
__fi__ So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
__fi__ Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
__fi__ People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
__fi__ How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
__fi__ And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
__fi__ I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
__fi__ And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
__fi__ Thank you very much .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ ( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
__fi__ But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
__fi__ This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
__fi__ I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
__fi__ It &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
__fi__ It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
__fi__ So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
__fi__ Sort of an interesting thing .
__fi__ It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
__fi__ And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
__fi__ You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
__fi__ In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
__fi__ And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
__fi__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
__fi__ I actually went to see this one .
__fi__ There was a lot of people there .
__fi__ Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
__fi__ Thank you .
__fi__ Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Arusha , Tanzania .
__fi__ I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations .
__fi__ It was a simple machine that changed my life .
__fi__ Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Malawi .
__fi__ I had never used a computer .
__fi__ I had never seen an Internet .
__fi__ On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
__fi__ My English lost , I wanted to vomit .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu , white people . ( Laughter )
__fi__ There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
__fi__ But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
__fi__ I would like to share that story today .
__fi__ We have seven children in my family .
__fi__ All sisters , excepting me .
__fi__ This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
__fi__ Before I discovered the wonders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
__fi__ Like everyone else , we grew maize .
__fi__ One year our fortune turned very bad .
__fi__ In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
__fi__ Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death .
__fi__ My family ate one meal per day , at night .
__fi__ Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
__fi__ The food passes through our bodies .
__fi__ We drop down to nothing .
__fi__ In Malawi , the secondary school , you have to pay school fees .
__fi__ Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
__fi__ I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
__fi__ It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
__fi__ I felt very happy to be at the secondary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
__fi__ So I went to a library .
__fi__ I read books , science books , especially physics .
__fi__ I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
__fi__ I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them .
__fi__ Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
__fi__ It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
__fi__ Pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
__fi__ So I decided I would build one windmill for myself .
__fi__ But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials .
__fi__ Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan , shock absorber , PVC pipes .
__fi__ Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , I built my machine .
__fi__ It was one light at first .
__fi__ And then four lights , with switches , and even a circuit breaker , modeled after an electric bell .
__fi__ Another machine pumps water for irrigation .
__fi__ Queues of people start lining up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
__fi__ ( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) And the reporters came too , which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
__fi__ I had never seen an airplane before .
__fi__ I had never slept in a hotel .
__fi__ So , on stage that day in Arusha , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
__fi__ So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
__fi__ God bless .
__fi__ Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
__fi__ I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
__fi__ Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
__fi__ Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
__fi__ You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
__fi__ And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
__fi__ If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
__fi__ And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
__fi__ We would never do that in our own countries .
__fi__ But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
__fi__ This is happening to us today .
__fi__ And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
__fi__ And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
__fi__ And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
__fi__ If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
__fi__ We have three main groups .
__fi__ We have online criminals .
__fi__ Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
__fi__ And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
__fi__ These guys make money .
__fi__ They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
__fi__ We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
__fi__ Here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
__fi__ This is Alfred Gonzalez .
__fi__ This is Stephen Watt .
__fi__ This is Bjorn Sundin .
__fi__ This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on .
__fi__ These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
__fi__ The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
__fi__ Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
__fi__ And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
__fi__ And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
__fi__ In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
__fi__ The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
__fi__ They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
__fi__ Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
__fi__ So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
__fi__ And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
__fi__ This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
__fi__ DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands — or actually , it was .
__fi__ It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
__fi__ Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
__fi__ And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
__fi__ And his answer was yes .
__fi__ So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
__fi__ Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
__fi__ They sell certificates .
__fi__ What do you do with certificates ?
__fi__ Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
__fi__ Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
__fi__ Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
__fi__ and issue rogue certificates .
__fi__ And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
__fi__ What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
__fi__ Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
__fi__ Among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; &quot; FINFISHER . &quot; &quot; And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
__fi__ They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
__fi__ The company headquarters are right here .
__fi__ So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
__fi__ But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
__fi__ For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
__fi__ If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
__fi__ But today , it goes beyond that .
__fi__ They will tap your Internet connection .
__fi__ They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
__fi__ Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
__fi__ Why should I worry ?
__fi__ Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
__fi__ Privacy is implied .
__fi__ Privacy is not up for discussion .
__fi__ This is not a question between privacy against security .
__fi__ It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
__fi__ And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
__fi__ And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
__fi__ And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
__fi__ I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
__fi__ Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
__fi__ It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
__fi__ And , consequently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
__fi__ &quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
__fi__ So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
__fi__ Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
__fi__ It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
__fi__ But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
__fi__ Values are a certain kind of fact .
__fi__ They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
__fi__ Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
__fi__ Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
__fi__ It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
__fi__ Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
__fi__ And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
__fi__ Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
__fi__ And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
__fi__ Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
__fi__ We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
__fi__ And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
__fi__ And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
__fi__ Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
__fi__ Probably not .
__fi__ Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
__fi__ There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
__fi__ And morality relates to these truths .
__fi__ So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
__fi__ Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
__fi__ But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
__fi__ Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
__fi__ Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality — his rather unfortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
__fi__ So the contributions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
__fi__ And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
__fi__ So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
__fi__ And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
__fi__ And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
__fi__ And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
__fi__ And these await our discovery .
__fi__ Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
__fi__ Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
__fi__ Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
__fi__ I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
__fi__ And just admitting this — just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
__fi__ For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
__fi__ And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
__fi__ The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
__fi__ We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
__fi__ And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
__fi__ The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child — this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
__fi__ But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
__fi__ Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
__fi__ And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
__fi__ Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
__fi__ The concept of physical health is undefined .
__fi__ As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
__fi__ When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
__fi__ It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
__fi__ There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
__fi__ People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
__fi__ The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
__fi__ Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
__fi__ Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
__fi__ Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
__fi__ There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
__fi__ But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
__fi__ The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
__fi__ Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
__fi__ So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
__fi__ Why would we think this ?
__fi__ Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
__fi__ Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
__fi__ But it clearly admits some exceptions .
__fi__ There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
__fi__ There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
__fi__ And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
__fi__ The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
__fi__ Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
__fi__ Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
__fi__ Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
__fi__ Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
__fi__ And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
__fi__ Well , who are we not to say this ?
__fi__ Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
__fi__ I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
__fi__ But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
__fi__ Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
__fi__ What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
__fi__ Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
__fi__ For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
__fi__ Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
__fi__ Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
__fi__ But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
__fi__ Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
__fi__ And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
__fi__ In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
__fi__ This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
__fi__ But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
__fi__ Now , what stands in the way of this ?
__fi__ Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially secular , academic , scientist types .
__fi__ When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
__fi__ So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
__fi__ On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
__fi__ So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
__fi__ He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
__fi__ There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot; &quot; Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
__fi__ On the left you have Edward Witten .
__fi__ He &apos;s a string theorist .
__fi__ If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
__fi__ The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; String theory is bogus .
__fi__ It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
__fi__ I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
__fi__ I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
__fi__ But this is just the point .
__fi__ Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
__fi__ That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
__fi__ That is what it is for knowledge to count .
__fi__ How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
__fi__ that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
__fi__ that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
__fi__ Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
__fi__ ( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
__fi__ It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
__fi__ It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
__fi__ Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
__fi__ We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
__fi__ We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
__fi__ It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
__fi__ We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
__fi__ And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
__fi__ Thank you very much .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there .
__fi__ Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
__fi__ Language seems to be really important here .
__fi__ When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
__fi__ I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
__fi__ And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
__fi__ I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
__fi__ Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
__fi__ And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face — I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
__fi__ And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
__fi__ CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
__fi__ But can you reconcile that ?
__fi__ I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
__fi__ Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
__fi__ SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
__fi__ So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
__fi__ So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
__fi__ It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
__fi__ I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
__fi__ Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
__fi__ And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
__fi__ CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
__fi__ SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
__fi__ So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
__fi__ But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
__fi__ It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
__fi__ CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
__fi__ We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
__fi__ SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and Amy in particular .
__fi__ I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
__fi__ I have not slept in weeks .
__fi__ Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we &apos;ve slept in anticipation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 Valencia , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
__fi__ Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
__fi__ So I would walk around in a daze during the day .
__fi__ I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
__fi__ In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park Slope , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
__fi__ Meanwhile , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
__fi__ My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
__fi__ And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
__fi__ But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the struggles they were dealing with .
__fi__ And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
__fi__ Now , so many of these students had come from households where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning disabilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under-funded .
__fi__ And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-on-one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
__fi__ This can lead up to 150 , 180 , 200 students a day .
__fi__ How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers .
__fi__ And so we started talking about this .
__fi__ And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , editors , journalists , graduate students , assistant professors , you name it .
__fi__ All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
__fi__ But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
__fi__ And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
__fi__ So when I moved back to San Francisco , we rented this building .
__fi__ And the idea was to put McSweeney &apos;s — McSweeney &apos;s Quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
__fi__ It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
__fi__ We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center .
__fi__ So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and editors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written homework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
__fi__ You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
__fi__ So , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . We did this mural , that &apos;s a Chris Ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form — it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
__fi__ So we rented this space .
__fi__ And everything was great except the landlord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is zoned for retail ; you have to come up with something .
__fi__ You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
__fi__ You can &apos;t just have a tutoring center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; Ha ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
__fi__ It used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
__fi__ We took all that down , and we found beautiful wooden floors , whitewashed beams and it had the look — while we were renovating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
__fi__ And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
__fi__ Let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; &quot; This is the pirate supply store .
__fi__ You see , this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin .
__fi__ A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pirate supply-like .
__fi__ Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
__fi__ We have the peg legs there , that are all handmade and fitted to you .
__fi__ Up at the top , you see the eyepatch display , which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch , and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night — special occasions , bar mitzvahs and whatever .
__fi__ So we opened this place . And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
__fi__ This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .
__fi__ These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; Practical Joking with Pirates . &quot;
__fi__ While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .
__fi__ That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
__fi__ It became mop heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a saltwater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tutoring center .
__fi__ So right there is the tutoring center , and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that .
__fi__ The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
__fi__ We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months renovating this place .
__fi__ We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
__fi__ I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle .
__fi__ Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
__fi__ It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
__fi__ And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; &quot; Free Tutoring for Your English-Related and Writing-Related Needs — Just Come In , It &apos;s All Free . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the gates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
__fi__ And so we waited , we sat at the tables , we waited and waited .
__fi__ And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited , really , where nobody came in .
__fi__ And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pirate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
__fi__ And so then , around that time , I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari , a longtime San Francisco educator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
__fi__ She took over as executive director .
__fi__ Immediately , she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
__fi__ And what we were trying to offer every day was one-on-one attention .
__fi__ The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students .
__fi__ You know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
__fi__ And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
__fi__ They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored .
__fi__ So that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
__fi__ And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
__fi__ If you &apos;re on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m. , 2 : 30 p.m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big backpacks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
__fi__ But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
__fi__ And the other thing was , there was no stigma .
__fi__ Kids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 826 Valencia .
__fi__ First of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
__fi__ And then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
__fi__ And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
__fi__ And so it became a tutoring center — publishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
__fi__ They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gifted kids , too .
__fi__ So there &apos;s no stigma .
__fi__ They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative endeavor .
__fi__ They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re modeling their behavior .
__fi__ These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
__fi__ They can lean over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other .
__fi__ There &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . The only problem , especially for the adults working at McSweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
__fi__ But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day , working one-on-one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t stall .
__fi__ They don &apos;t do their homework in front of the TV .
__fi__ They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
__fi__ And that makes a happy family .
__fi__ A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
__fi__ A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
__fi__ So the key to it all is homework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-on-one attention .
__fi__ So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
__fi__ And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster .
__fi__ And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
__fi__ The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
__fi__ So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
__fi__ Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
__fi__ So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being typed up above .
__fi__ This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
__fi__ You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
__fi__ So this is one of the books that they do .
__fi__ Notice the title of the book , &quot; The Book That Was Never Checked Out : Titanic . &quot;
__fi__ And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic . &quot; &quot; So , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
__fi__ So then we still had more tutors to use .
__fi__ This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events .
__fi__ The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
__fi__ We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely malleable . You &apos;re going to tell us .
__fi__ The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
__fi__ The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
__fi__ Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,400 people on our tutor roster .
__fi__ Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays .
__fi__ We &apos;re working on our college essays . Send them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,400 tutors .
__fi__ Whoever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
__fi__ The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
__fi__ They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
__fi__ And that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
__fi__ So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
__fi__ Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Everett Middle School Writers &apos; Room , where we decorated it in buccaneer style .
__fi__ It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .
__fi__ This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; Straight-Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages — English and Spanish .
__fi__ So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you assign a book with high school students ?
__fi__ I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assignment to the students .
__fi__ And we said , &quot; &quot; Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
__fi__ She &apos;s going to publish them in a book .
__fi__ She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
__fi__ It &apos;s going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Isabel Allende on the other end .
__fi__ I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
__fi__ We had a big party at the end .
__fi__ This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
__fi__ You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one , &quot; I Might Get Somewhere . &quot;
__fi__ And this became an ongoing thing . More and more books .
__fi__ Now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
__fi__ The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
__fi__ And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
__fi__ It &apos;s absolutely transformative .
__fi__ And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the planks .
__fi__ We sell all the student books .
__fi__ Where else would you put them , right ?
__fi__ So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a gag — the store actually made money .
__fi__ So it was paying the rent .
__fi__ And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
__fi__ But people would come in — and this was before the pirate movies and everything !
__fi__ It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-time staff member there .
__fi__ There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
__fi__ And it became a gateway to the community .
__fi__ People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
__fi__ What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to swear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
__fi__ They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
__fi__ And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tutored .
__fi__ This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some lard , or millet for their parrot , or , you know , a hook , or hook protector for nighttime , all of these things we sell .
__fi__ So the store actually did really well .
__fi__ But it brought in so many people — teachers , donors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
__fi__ It wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
__fi__ So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
__fi__ So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
__fi__ And a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
__fi__ They didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
__fi__ They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
__fi__ So , knowing the crime-fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company .
__fi__ This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
__fi__ And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
__fi__ So they opened this place . Inside , it &apos;s like a Costco for superheroes — all the supplies in kind of basic form .
__fi__ These are all handmade .
__fi__ These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
__fi__ All the packaging is done by Sam Potts .
__fi__ So then you have the villain containment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
__fi__ This is a little vault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
__fi__ Personally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
__fi__ Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
__fi__ These are some of the products . These are all handmade .
__fi__ This is a secret identity kit .
__fi__ If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone , one American female marketing executive from Hoboken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone .
__fi__ So , this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape , and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
__fi__ There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that .
__fi__ So then , the secret door — this is one of the shelves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
__fi__ You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks .
__fi__ It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
__fi__ But this is — I just want to emphasize — locally funded , locally built .
__fi__ All the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
__fi__ I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tutoring hours .
__fi__ It &apos;s very busy . Same principles : one-on-one attention , complete devotion to the students &apos; work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
__fi__ And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
__fi__ So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
__fi__ It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
__fi__ This is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
__fi__ You can read this quote .
__fi__ Addicted to video games and TV . Couldn &apos;t concentrate at home .
__fi__ Came in . Got this concentrated attention .
__fi__ And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
__fi__ So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his homework early — got really addicted to finishing his homework early .
__fi__ It &apos;s an addictive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it checked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
__fi__ So he got hooked on that , and then he started doing other things .
__fi__ He &apos;s now been published in five books .
__fi__ He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called &quot; &quot; Super-Has-Beens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Penguin Balboa , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a boxing — penguin .
__fi__ And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space , at a benefit for 826 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
__fi__ He &apos;s evangelical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
__fi__ There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
__fi__ So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
__fi__ This is L.A. , The Echo Park Time Travel Mart : &quot; &quot; Whenever You Are , We &apos;re Already Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers .
__fi__ So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-Eleven would be .
__fi__ Leeches . Mammoth chunks . They even have their own Slurpee machine : &quot; &quot; Out of Order . Come Back Yesterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
__fi__ These are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : Word St. in Pittsfield , Massachusetts ; Ink Spot in Cincinnati ; Youth Speaks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis ; Austin Bat Cave in Austin ; Fighting Words in Dublin , Ireland , started by Roddy Doyle , this will be open in April .
__fi__ Now I &apos;m going to the TED Wish — is that okay ?
__fi__ All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED Wish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transformative partnerships .
__fi__ Profound leaps forward !
__fi__ And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
__fi__ I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
__fi__ I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
__fi__ We created a website .
__fi__ I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .
__fi__ We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .
__fi__ Always let the teachers lead the way .
__fi__ They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
__fi__ There are a million ways .
__fi__ You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
__fi__ So , this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco , they did this phenomenal job .
__fi__ This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once Upon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
__fi__ This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
__fi__ Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline . So , visit the site .
__fi__ If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
__fi__ You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
__fi__ And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
__fi__ And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it needn &apos;t be sterile . It needn &apos;t be bureaucratically untenable .
__fi__ You can do and use the skills that you have .
__fi__ The schools need you . The teachers need you .
__fi__ Students and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
__fi__ Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
__fi__ You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
__fi__ Thank you so much .
__fi__ So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
__fi__ And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street .
__fi__ This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
__fi__ Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
__fi__ So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
__fi__ They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
__fi__ Blocks have names .
__fi__ Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
__fi__ All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
__fi__ And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
__fi__ There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
__fi__ The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
__fi__ The second house ever built is house number two .
__fi__ Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
__fi__ So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
__fi__ So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
__fi__ ( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
__fi__ But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
__fi__ So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
__fi__ And this map is also accurate .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
__fi__ So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
__fi__ Domo arigato gozaimashita .
