__fi__ I love the Internet .
__fi__ It &apos;s true .
__fi__ Think about everything it has brought us .
__fi__ Think about all the services we use , all the connectivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
__fi__ And it &apos;s happening during our lifetimes .
__fi__ I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
__fi__ But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
__fi__ I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
__fi__ So let me show you something .
__fi__ This here is Brain .
__fi__ This is a floppy disk — five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.
__fi__ It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
__fi__ And we actually know where Brain came from .
__fi__ We know because it says so inside the code .
__fi__ Let &apos;s take a look .
__fi__ All right .
__fi__ That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 1986 , Basit and Amjad .
__fi__ And Basit and Amjad are first names , Pakistani first names .
__fi__ In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
__fi__ That &apos;s 25 years ago .
__fi__ Let me give you an example .
__fi__ The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
__fi__ If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__fi__ And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
__fi__ And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
__fi__ A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
__fi__ Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
__fi__ The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
__fi__ That &apos;s just a decade away .
__fi__ China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
__fi__ First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
__fi__ And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
__fi__ Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
__fi__ Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
__fi__ Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
__fi__ This is an illusion .
__fi__ It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
__fi__ It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
__fi__ China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
__fi__ It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
__fi__ Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
__fi__ How do we try to understand what China is ?
__fi__ And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
__fi__ We can &apos;t .
__fi__ Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
__fi__ The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
__fi__ Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
__fi__ This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period — the birth of modern China .
__fi__ And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
__fi__ Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
__fi__ And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
__fi__ Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
__fi__ I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
__fi__ These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
__fi__ In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
__fi__ And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
__fi__ What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
__fi__ You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
__fi__ It &apos;s never been the case .
__fi__ So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
__fi__ And what does it mean ?
__fi__ Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
__fi__ I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
__fi__ The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
__fi__ You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown — the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
__fi__ It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
__fi__ China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
__fi__ The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
__fi__ Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
__fi__ You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
__fi__ One country , two systems .
__fi__ And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
__fi__ &quot; &quot; Window dressing .
__fi__ When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
__fi__ We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
__fi__ We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
__fi__ Think of German unification , 1990 .
__fi__ What happened ?
__fi__ Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
__fi__ One nation , one system .
__fi__ That is the nation-state mentality .
__fi__ But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
__fi__ It doesn &apos;t work .
__fi__ So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of Taiwan — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
__fi__ Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
__fi__ The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
__fi__ Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
__fi__ Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
__fi__ India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil — all of them are multiracial .
__fi__ The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
__fi__ China is only multiracial really at the margins .
__fi__ So the question is , why ?
__fi__ Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
__fi__ A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged — of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
__fi__ Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
__fi__ The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
__fi__ The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
__fi__ They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
__fi__ Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
__fi__ Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
__fi__ Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
__fi__ Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
__fi__ The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
__fi__ And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
__fi__ And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
__fi__ And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
__fi__ This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
__fi__ And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged — I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
__fi__ It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
__fi__ So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
__fi__ The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
__fi__ Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
__fi__ The Chinese view the state as an intimate — not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
__fi__ This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
__fi__ It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
__fi__ And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
__fi__ Know that China believes in the market and the state .
__fi__ I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
__fi__ But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
__fi__ The state is everywhere in China .
__fi__ I mean , it &apos;s leading firms — many of them are still publicly owned .
__fi__ Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
__fi__ Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
__fi__ And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-child policy .
__fi__ Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
__fi__ I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
__fi__ But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
__fi__ and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
__fi__ It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
__fi__ So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
__fi__ So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
__fi__ And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
__fi__ If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect — this is the reason .
__fi__ Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
__fi__ It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
__fi__ It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
__fi__ And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
__fi__ We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
__fi__ You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
__fi__ And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
__fi__ But it &apos;s not .
__fi__ In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
__fi__ Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
__fi__ Whereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West — have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
__fi__ And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
__fi__ I mean , take the question of East Asia .
__fi__ East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
__fi__ Now the largest economic region in the world .
__fi__ And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
__fi__ Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
__fi__ Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
__fi__ What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
__fi__ We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
__fi__ And there are two consequences of this .
__fi__ First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
__fi__ There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenhagen , climate change conference .
__fi__ Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
__fi__ When did that last happen ?
__fi__ I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
__fi__ And that is what is going to happen in the future .
__fi__ And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
__fi__ And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
__fi__ Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
__fi__ But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
__fi__ I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
__fi__ Take the 19th century , for example .
__fi__ But this , alas , is no longer true .
__fi__ If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Confucius .
__fi__ This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
__fi__ It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
__fi__ This is the new &#91; Wuhan &#93; railway station for the high-speed trains .
__fi__ China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
__fi__ Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
__fi__ Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
__fi__ It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
__fi__ And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
__fi__ Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
__fi__ So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
__fi__ Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
__fi__ Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
__fi__ I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
__fi__ But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
__fi__ For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
__fi__ That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
__fi__ The arrival of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
__fi__ Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
__fi__ As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
__fi__ This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
__fi__ The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
__fi__ I think they &apos;re playing golf .
__fi__ Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
__fi__ Welcome to the future . Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
__fi__ But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
__fi__ So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
__fi__ Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
__fi__ Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
__fi__ So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
__fi__ So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
__fi__ You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
__fi__ Narrator : Here they are arriving at Number 10 .
__fi__ Even the BBC and The New York Times .
__fi__ So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language — but we call it nonverbals as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
__fi__ When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
__fi__ And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this .
__fi__ And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
__fi__ And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
__fi__ For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
__fi__ If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
__fi__ We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
__fi__ So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
__fi__ I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
__fi__ I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
__fi__ And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
__fi__ So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
__fi__ So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
__fi__ It &apos;s about opening up .
__fi__ This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied .
__fi__ We make ourselves small .
__fi__ And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
__fi__ So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
__fi__ So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
__fi__ When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
__fi__ You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
__fi__ I notice a couple of things about this .
__fi__ So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
__fi__ Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
__fi__ And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
__fi__ So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
__fi__ So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
__fi__ There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
__fi__ So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
__fi__ So it goes both ways .
__fi__ So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
__fi__ And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
__fi__ So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
__fi__ So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
__fi__ They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
__fi__ So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
__fi__ But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
__fi__ So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
__fi__ Probably not , right ?
__fi__ So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
__fi__ So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
__fi__ Here are a couple more .
__fi__ So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
__fi__ And here are the low-power poses .
__fi__ So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
__fi__ When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
__fi__ So this is what happens .
__fi__ That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
__fi__ Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
__fi__ So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
__fi__ Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol .
__fi__ So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
__fi__ Also , our bodies change our minds .
__fi__ And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations , like social threat situations .
__fi__ Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
__fi__ It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
__fi__ So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
__fi__ It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
__fi__ So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
__fi__ People hate this .
__fi__ We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
__fi__ They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
__fi__ It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
__fi__ These kinds of things .
__fi__ So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
__fi__ So I said , fake it till you make it .
__fi__ I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
__fi__ I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
__fi__ When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
__fi__ I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
__fi__ I was thrown from the car .
__fi__ I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
__fi__ So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
__fi__ They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
__fi__ I am an impostor .
__fi__ You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
__fi__ Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
__fi__ I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
__fi__ Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
__fi__ So she had changed .
__fi__ And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
__fi__ Fake it till you become it .
__fi__ Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
__fi__ The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
__fi__ Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
__fi__ So , this is two minutes .
__fi__ Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
__fi__ That &apos;s what you want to do .
__fi__ Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
__fi__ Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
__fi__ Thank you .
__fi__ Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
__fi__ Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
__fi__ Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
__fi__ Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
__fi__ It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
__fi__ Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
__fi__ It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
__fi__ Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
__fi__ This is a time of need .
__fi__ Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
__fi__ And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
__fi__ To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
__fi__ Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
__fi__ ( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
__fi__ Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
__fi__ Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
__fi__ A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
__fi__ A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
__fi__ And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
__fi__ The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
__fi__ Sure , she had aged a little .
__fi__ In fact , she had aged a lot .
__fi__ But he felt all his old passion for her return .
__fi__ &quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
__fi__ &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
__fi__ &quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
__fi__ Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
__fi__ Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
__fi__ The earth moved for both of them .
__fi__ And they lived together happily ever after .
__fi__ And all because he decided to walk that day .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
__fi__ The moral imperative is on the table .
__fi__ Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
__fi__ To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
__fi__ So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
__fi__ Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
__fi__ And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ About a year and a half ago , Stephen Lawler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps , which is Microsoft &apos;s online-mapping effort .
__fi__ In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online .
__fi__ And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
__fi__ So , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with Seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
__fi__ Mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
__fi__ So , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
__fi__ This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the facades .
__fi__ Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
__fi__ If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
__fi__ So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
__fi__ This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
__fi__ It &apos;s wonderful .
__fi__ But I &apos;m going to show you some more candy sort of stuff .
__fi__ So , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
__fi__ These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
__fi__ I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photosynths are integrated into the map .
__fi__ Everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
__fi__ And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of panoramic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geometry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
__fi__ Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr .
__fi__ This takes Flickr , georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tourist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
__fi__ So this one was taken around five .
__fi__ So that &apos;s the Flickr photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
__fi__ So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__fi__ There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
__fi__ And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well .
__fi__ But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augmented reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
__fi__ Now I just made a transition indoors . That &apos;s also interesting .
__fi__ OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
__fi__ We &apos;re inside the Pike Place Market .
__fi__ And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
__fi__ And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
__fi__ So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frightening .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) OK .
__fi__ ( Ringing ) All right , guys , are you there ?
__fi__ ( Noise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m punching play .
__fi__ I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
__fi__ So , these are our friends in Pike Place Market , the lab .
__fi__ ( Applause ) So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
__fi__ OK , George , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
__fi__ Because I want to show points of interest .
__fi__ No , no . The other way .
__fi__ Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__fi__ I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
__fi__ OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
__fi__ OK , never mind .
__fi__ What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality .
__fi__ What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
__fi__ We &apos;re doing two different things here .
__fi__ One of them is to take that real ...
__fi__ ( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
__fi__ They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
__fi__ ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
__fi__ And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
__fi__ When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
__fi__ So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broadcasting it .
__fi__ That was being broadcast , by the way , on a 4G network from the market .
__fi__ All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
__fi__ And that &apos;s Curtis Wong , WorldWide Telescope .
__fi__ So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .
__fi__ This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps .
__fi__ ( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we scrub the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
__fi__ I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
__fi__ So , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
__fi__ All right now , I &apos;ve overrun my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
__fi__ Thank you all very much .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
__fi__ And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests — basically the longest route we can possibly take .
__fi__ And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
__fi__ &quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
__fi__ My friend looks at me totally blankly .
__fi__ There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
__fi__ And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area . ( Laughter )
__fi__ I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
__fi__ In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
__fi__ This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
__fi__ We get it in the abstract .
__fi__ We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
__fi__ The human species , in general , is fallible — okay fine .
__fi__ But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
__fi__ And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
__fi__ We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
__fi__ So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
__fi__ I think this is a problem .
__fi__ I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
__fi__ So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
__fi__ And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
__fi__ And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
__fi__ So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
__fi__ One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
__fi__ So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emotionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
__fi__ Dreadful . Thumbs down .
__fi__ Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
__fi__ Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
__fi__ You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
__fi__ I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
__fi__ But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
__fi__ I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
__fi__ Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
__fi__ In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
__fi__ But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
__fi__ And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
__fi__ He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
__fi__ That &apos;s when he falls .
__fi__ When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
__fi__ You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
__fi__ So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
__fi__ It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
__fi__ I call this error blindness .
__fi__ Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
__fi__ But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
__fi__ Think back for a moment to elementary school .
__fi__ You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
__fi__ This is not mine , by the way .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
__fi__ It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
__fi__ So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
__fi__ We learn these really bad lessons really well .
__fi__ And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
__fi__ Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
__fi__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
__fi__ Okay , so fine .
__fi__ Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
__fi__ Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
__fi__ So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
__fi__ So let me tell you a story .
__fi__ A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
__fi__ Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
__fi__ It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
__fi__ So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
__fi__ She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing — stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
__fi__ Everything seems to have gone fine .
__fi__ And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
__fi__ When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
__fi__ He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
__fi__ This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
__fi__ And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
__fi__ So this is a huge practical problem .
__fi__ But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
__fi__ Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
__fi__ It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
__fi__ And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
__fi__ It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
__fi__ The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
__fi__ They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
__fi__ When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
__fi__ And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
__fi__ So this is a catastrophe .
__fi__ This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
__fi__ But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
__fi__ It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
__fi__ And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
__fi__ That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
__fi__ The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
__fi__ It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
__fi__ We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
__fi__ And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
__fi__ And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
__fi__ 1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
__fi__ Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
__fi__ It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
__fi__ Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
__fi__ And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
__fi__ To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
__fi__ Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
__fi__ And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
__fi__ And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
__fi__ I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
__fi__ I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
__fi__ But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
__fi__ And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
__fi__ In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
__fi__ And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
__fi__ We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
__fi__ We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
__fi__ When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
__fi__ But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
__fi__ We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
__fi__ George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
__fi__ And something else happened instead .
__fi__ And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
__fi__ And something else happened instead .
__fi__ And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
__fi__ And something else happened instead .
__fi__ And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
__fi__ And something else happened instead .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
__fi__ For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
__fi__ No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
__fi__ We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
__fi__ Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering — TED 1998 — eh .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
__fi__ Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
__fi__ ( Applause ) So here we are again .
__fi__ And that &apos;s how it goes .
__fi__ We come up with another idea .
__fi__ We tell another story .
__fi__ We hold another conference .
__fi__ The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
__fi__ And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
__fi__ Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
__fi__ Sadly , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not .
__fi__ El-Sayyid Nosair is my father .
__fi__ However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
__fi__ He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
__fi__ My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; Ibn abuh . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
__fi__ Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens , an amusement park .
__fi__ There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
__fi__ Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexuality was a sin , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
__fi__ Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
__fi__ Then there was &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; On a nightly basis , Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
__fi__ He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one .
__fi__ In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
__fi__ Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .
__fi__ Well , that &apos;s simple .
__fi__ Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
__fi__ I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
__fi__ And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
__fi__ I am not my father .
__fi__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
__fi__ Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
__fi__ As a cyber-magician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
__fi__ You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Glass .
__fi__ It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
__fi__ So these are my illusion glasses .
__fi__ They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
__fi__ And when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
__fi__ Let me show you what I mean .
__fi__ All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
__fi__ Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
__fi__ All right . Very significant mark .
__fi__ And let &apos;s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
__fi__ ( Music ) Voice : System ready . Acquiring image .
__fi__ Marco Tempest : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
__fi__ The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
__fi__ Now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
__fi__ There &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   Voice : My favorite season is winter.MT : Well yeah , mine too .
__fi__ Winter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
__fi__ There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
__fi__ MT : So over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
__fi__ Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
__fi__ MT : There are two colors in a deck of cards .
__fi__ There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
__fi__ Voice : Marco , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) MT : And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
__fi__ ( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
__fi__ MT : Oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
__fi__ Make a wish . ( Blowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
__fi__ MT : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? MT : Ah , mischief-makers . Watch .
__fi__ Wake up .
__fi__ Joker : Whoa.MT : Are you ready for your party piece ?
__fi__ Joker : Ready ! MT : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
__fi__ Joker : Presenting my pogo stick.MT : Ah . Watch out .
__fi__ Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
__fi__ I &apos;m performing for you .
__fi__ Voice : Signed card detected.MT : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? Is it a 9-to-5 job ?
__fi__ Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
__fi__ I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
__fi__ 24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
__fi__ Well , to this , I just say , no no .
__fi__ Actually , in German , it &apos;s nein nein . ( Laughter ) Magic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .

__fi__ There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
__fi__ This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
__fi__ I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
__fi__ It &apos;s awful .
__fi__ In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ So in college , I was a government major , which means I had to write a lot of papers .
__fi__ Now , when a normal student writes a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
__fi__ And I would want to do that like that .
__fi__ That would be the plan .
__fi__ I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
__fi__ But then came my 90-page senior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
__fi__ So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bump it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase .
__fi__ How hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
__fi__ No big deal , right ?
__fi__ But then , the funniest thing happened .
__fi__ Those first few months ?
__fi__ They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff .
__fi__ So we had an awesome new revised plan .
__fi__ And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
__fi__ And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline , still not having written a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours , pulling not one but two all-nighters — humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters — sprinted across campus , dove in slow motion , and got it in just at the deadline .
__fi__ I thought that was the end of everything .
__fi__ And they say , &quot; &quot; Is this Tim Urban ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
__fi__ No , no , it was very , very bad .
__fi__ Anyway , today I &apos;m a writer-blogger guy .
__fi__ I write the blog Wait But Why .
__fi__ And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about procrastination .
__fi__ My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me , and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators , and why we are the way we are .
__fi__ And to test this , I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator , so I could compare them .
__fi__ I actually brought them here to show you today .
__fi__ I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
__fi__ So here &apos;s the brain of a non-procrastinator .
__fi__ here &apos;s my brain .
__fi__ Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them , but the procrastinator &apos;s brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey .
__fi__ Now , what does this mean for the procrastinator ?
__fi__ He lives entirely in the present moment .
__fi__ Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
__fi__ If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
__fi__ You have to keep well-slept , well-fed and propagating into the next generation , which in tribal times might have worked OK .
__fi__ But , if you haven &apos;t noticed , now we &apos;re not in tribal times .
__fi__ We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , and the Monkey does not know what that is .
__fi__ We can visualize the future .
__fi__ We can see the big picture .
__fi__ And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
__fi__ Sometimes they agree .
__fi__ But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant , for the sake of the big picture .
__fi__ And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
__fi__ I call it the Dark Playground .
__fi__ It &apos;s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening .
__fi__ And the question is , in this situation , with the Monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
__fi__ And importantly , he &apos;s the only thing the Monkey is terrified of .
__fi__ Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
__fi__ It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
__fi__ As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the speakers .
__fi__ And I opened up the website , and there was my face staring right back at me .
__fi__ And guess who woke up ?
__fi__ And the Monkey — remember , he &apos;s terrified of the Panic Monster — boom , he &apos;s up the tree !
__fi__ Now , the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior , like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper , and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages .
__fi__ And this entire situation , with the three characters — this is the procrastinator &apos;s system .
__fi__ It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
__fi__ This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
__fi__ When I did , I was amazed by the response .
__fi__ Literally thousands of emails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
__fi__ But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails .
__fi__ These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives , about what this Monkey had done to them .
__fi__ And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the procrastinator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?
__fi__ Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of procrastination .
__fi__ Now if the procrastinator &apos;s only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these non-deadline situations , the Panic Monster doesn &apos;t show up .
__fi__ It &apos;s usually suffered quietly and privately .
__fi__ And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness , and regrets .
__fi__ It &apos;s that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator , at times , in their own lives .
__fi__ The frustration is not that they couldn &apos;t achieve their dreams ; it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t even able to start chasing them .
__fi__ So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany — that I don &apos;t think non-procrastinators exist .
__fi__ That &apos;s right — I think all of you are procrastinators .
__fi__ Now , I want to show you one last thing .
__fi__ I call this a Life Calendar .
__fi__ That &apos;s one box for every week of a 90-year life .
__fi__ That &apos;s not that many boxes , especially since we &apos;ve already used a bunch of those .
__fi__ So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calendar .
__fi__ We need to think about what we &apos;re really procrastinating on , because everyone is procrastinating on something in life .
__fi__ We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey .
__fi__ That &apos;s a job for all of us .
__fi__ And because there &apos;s not that many boxes on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today .
__fi__ Well , maybe not today , but ...
__fi__ Sometime soon .
__fi__ Thank you .
__fi__ The column came under ambush , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead .
__fi__ One of the people he rescued was a sergeant , and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter .
__fi__ And what was remarkable about this day is , by sheer coincidence , one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera .
__fi__ It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck .
__fi__ They put him in the helicopter , and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more .
__fi__ I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
__fi__ What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
__fi__ In business , we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
__fi__ We have it backwards . Right ?
__fi__ So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
__fi__ And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
__fi__ That &apos;s why they &apos;re attracted to the military .
__fi__ These better people are attracted to this concept of service .
__fi__ But that &apos;s completely wrong .
__fi__ I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
__fi__ Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__fi__ It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
__fi__ So trust and cooperation are really important here .
__fi__ The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
__fi__ I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Trust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
__fi__ I can &apos;t simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
__fi__ It &apos;s not how it works . It &apos;s a feeling .
__fi__ So where does that feeling come from ?
__fi__ If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era , to the early days of Homo sapiens , what we find is that the world was filled with danger , all of these forces working very , very hard to kill us .
__fi__ Nothing personal .
__fi__ Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a saber-toothed tiger , all of these things working to reduce our lifespan .
__fi__ And so we evolved into social animals , where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety , inside the tribe , where we felt like we belonged .
__fi__ And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
__fi__ There are inherent benefits to this .
__fi__ It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger .
__fi__ If we don &apos;t trust each other , if I don &apos;t trust you , that means you won &apos;t watch for danger .
__fi__ Bad system of survival .
__fi__ The modern day is exactly the same thing .
__fi__ It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight .
__fi__ Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
__fi__ It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you .
__fi__ We have no control over these forces .
__fi__ These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
__fi__ The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
__fi__ He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon .
__fi__ So I said something .
__fi__ I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cattle ?
__fi__ Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
__fi__ The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
__fi__ It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
__fi__ You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inherently weakens the organization .
__fi__ When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities .
__fi__ The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
__fi__ If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
__fi__ Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
__fi__ They want to provide their people opportunity , education , discipline when necessary , build their self-confidence , give them the opportunity to try and fail , all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .
__fi__ Charlie Kim , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider laying off one of your children ?
__fi__ We would never do it .
__fi__ Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization ?
__fi__ Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment .
__fi__ If you get a job at Next Jump , you cannot get fired for performance issues .
__fi__ In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
__fi__ It &apos;s the complete opposite .
__fi__ This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred , anger , at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures .
__fi__ It &apos;s not the numbers .
__fi__ It &apos;s that they have violated the very definition of leadership .
__fi__ They have violated this deep-seated social contract .
__fi__ We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests .
__fi__ This is what so offends us , not the numbers .
__fi__ Would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to Gandhi ?
__fi__ How about a $ 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa ?
__fi__ Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
__fi__ Great leaders would never sacrifice
__fi__ the people to save the numbers .
__fi__ They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
__fi__ Bob Chapman , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight .
__fi__ Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
__fi__ They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discussed layoffs .
__fi__ And Bob refused .
__fi__ You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head counts .
__fi__ Bob believes in heart counts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
__fi__ And so they came up with a furlough program .
__fi__ Every employee , from secretary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation .
__fi__ They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it consecutively .
__fi__ They saved 20 million dollars , and most importantly , as would be expected , when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization , the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate .
__fi__ And quite spontaneously , nobody expected , people started trading with each other .
__fi__ Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
__fi__ People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
__fi__ Leadership is a choice . It is not a rank .
__fi__ I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
__fi__ They are authorities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
__fi__ And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
__fi__ This is what a leader is .
__fi__ I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater , and as is the Marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
__fi__ And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
__fi__ We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
__fi__ We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
__fi__ They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
__fi__ Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
__fi__ Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
__fi__ Underneath , I was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me .
__fi__ I was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
__fi__ This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
__fi__ And the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything I did in the third person .
__fi__ &quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
__fi__ It was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
__fi__ So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very adept at concealing how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
__fi__ A subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
__fi__ I spent some time telling the college G.P.
__fi__ And to be fair , I was desperate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange commentator .
__fi__ For example , I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
__fi__ It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
__fi__ A hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
__fi__ But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
__fi__ Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
__fi__ You see that glass of water ?
__fi__ In effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
__fi__ Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
__fi__ By now , I had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
__fi__ Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
__fi__ A broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be .
__fi__ Many people have harmed me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
__fi__ I believe that Eleanor can get through this .
__fi__ Sometimes , you know , it snows as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
__fi__ Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
__fi__ So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
__fi__ Now at first , I would have believed them .
__fi__ I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
__fi__ It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
__fi__ I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Strategic .
__fi__ It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
__fi__ This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
__fi__ To paraphrase Chavez , once social change begins , it cannot be reversed .
__fi__ You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride .
__fi__ You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
__fi__ In the last 20 years , the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
__fi__ As Peter Levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
__fi__ In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
__fi__ We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
__fi__ What lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
__fi__ The light never goes out .
__fi__ As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
__fi__ Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ Chris Anderson : Julian , welcome .
__fi__ It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
__fi__ Can that possibly be true ?
__fi__ Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
__fi__ It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
__fi__ CA : How does it work ?
__fi__ How do people release the documents ?
__fi__ And how do you secure their privacy ?
__fi__ JA : So these are — as far as we can tell — classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
__fi__ So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
__fi__ We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
__fi__ CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
__fi__ JA : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
__fi__ ( Phone ring ) God damn it .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership . ( Laughter )
__fi__ So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
__fi__ This is something you leaked a few years ago .
__fi__ If we can have this document up ...
__fi__ So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
__fi__ Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
__fi__ JA : So this is the Kroll Report .
__fi__ This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
__fi__ Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
__fi__ He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
__fi__ And when Kibaki got into power — through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
__fi__ And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man — still is the richest man — in Kenya .
__fi__ It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
__fi__ So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election — the national election , December 28 .
__fi__ When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
__fi__ CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
__fi__ JA : Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
__fi__ And so it came in from the outside .
__fi__ And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
__fi__ And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
__fi__ CA : Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
__fi__ JA : Yep .
__fi__ ( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
__fi__ The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
__fi__ This is — this is intense material , I should warn you .
__fi__ Radio : ... just fuckin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
__fi__ I see your element , uh , got about four Humvees , uh , out along ...
__fi__ You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
__fi__ Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
__fi__ Light &apos; em all up .
__fi__ C &apos;mon , fire !
__fi__ ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n . ( Machine gun fire ) Keep shoot &apos; n .
__fi__ Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six , Bushmaster Two-Six ,
__fi__ we need to move , time now !
__fi__ All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
__fi__ Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
__fi__ Roger . I got &apos; em .
__fi__ Two-Six , this is Two-Six , we &apos;re mobile .
__fi__ Oops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
__fi__ God damn it , Kyle . All right , hahaha . I hit &apos; em .
__fi__ CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
__fi__ JA : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
__fi__ We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
__fi__ So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
__fi__ CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
__fi__ JA : Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
__fi__ There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
__fi__ CA : And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
__fi__ What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
__fi__ JA : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
__fi__ You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people rescuing the wounded .
__fi__ And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
__fi__ CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
__fi__ I mean , did he ?
__fi__ JA : We have denied receiving those cables .
__fi__ He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
__fi__ Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
__fi__ I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
__fi__ CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
__fi__ JA : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) JA : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
__fi__ If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
__fi__ CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
__fi__ I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
__fi__ Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
__fi__ JA : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
__fi__ And there &apos;s a lot of information .
__fi__ So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
__fi__ And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
__fi__ CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
__fi__ JA : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
__fi__ I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
__fi__ We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identifying information in it .
__fi__ But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
__fi__ CA : So they are well-motivated .
__fi__ And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
__fi__ It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
__fi__ That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
__fi__ Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
__fi__ JA : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
__fi__ But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
__fi__ So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
__fi__ That &apos;s what they see every day .
__fi__ It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
__fi__ CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
__fi__ Light is good .
__fi__ But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
__fi__ JA : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
__fi__ We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
__fi__ Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
__fi__ CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
__fi__ You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
__fi__ You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
__fi__ Dangerous troublemaker .
__fi__ Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
__fi__ Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
__fi__ JA : Oh , come on . There must be some .
__fi__ CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
__fi__ We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
__fi__ Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
__fi__ I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
__fi__ What is this ?
__fi__ JA : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
__fi__ So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
__fi__ And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
__fi__ And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
__fi__ And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
__fi__ We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
__fi__ So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
__fi__ So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
__fi__ We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
__fi__ The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
__fi__ What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
__fi__ Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
__fi__ Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
__fi__ Yeah .
__fi__ ( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
__fi__ This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
__fi__ CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
__fi__ JA : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
__fi__ So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
__fi__ That &apos;s a problem .
__fi__ I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
__fi__ CA : So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
__fi__ JA : Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
__fi__ I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
__fi__ CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
__fi__ And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
__fi__ Can that be right ?
__fi__ JA : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
__fi__ ( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
__fi__ JA : What , the movie business ?
__fi__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
__fi__ JA : Well , I was a journalist .
__fi__ You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
__fi__ I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
__fi__ So you have to be careful with hacker .
__fi__ I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
__fi__ Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
__fi__ So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
__fi__ CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
__fi__ Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
__fi__ JA : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
__fi__ But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
__fi__ And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
__fi__ CA : Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
__fi__ JA : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way — there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
__fi__ And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
__fi__ CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
__fi__ You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
__fi__ Instead , they publicized your side .
__fi__ That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
__fi__ JA : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
__fi__ Iceland went through this financial crisis .
__fi__ It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
__fi__ Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
__fi__ Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
__fi__ And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
__fi__ Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
__fi__ And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
__fi__ Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
__fi__ And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
__fi__ CA : Wow .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
__fi__ When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
__fi__ JA : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
__fi__ I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world — within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
__fi__ Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
__fi__ That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
__fi__ CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
__fi__ JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
__fi__ My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
__fi__ And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of type-A women . This is a room
__fi__ of sleep-deprived women .
__fi__ And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
__fi__ Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
__fi__ I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
__fi__ And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
__fi__ And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
__fi__ ( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
__fi__ We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
__fi__ I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
__fi__ And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
__fi__ If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
__fi__ Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
__fi__ So a high I.Q.
__fi__ does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
__fi__ And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
__fi__ In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
__fi__ ( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
__fi__ So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
__fi__ So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
__fi__ Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
__fi__ And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails .
__fi__ Here is this mass of jelly , three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand , and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
__fi__ It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
__fi__ And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness , which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience , of neurology , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
__fi__ OK , so how do you study this mysterious organ ?
__fi__ I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other , and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
__fi__ How does this happen ?
__fi__ Well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
__fi__ One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
__fi__ What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities , a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability .
__fi__ What you get is a highly selective loss of one function , with other functions being preserved intact , and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function .
__fi__ So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
__fi__ So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
__fi__ So let me give you a few striking examples of this .
__fi__ In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
__fi__ The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome .
__fi__ If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the temporal lobes , frontal lobes , parietal lobes , OK — the lobes that constitute the brain .
__fi__ And if you look , tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
__fi__ And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s damaged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
__fi__ You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
__fi__ You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
__fi__ I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you wink and it winks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
__fi__ OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
__fi__ But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
__fi__ This is called the Capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
__fi__ She &apos;s some other woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
__fi__ Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects , but when he sees his mother , his delusion kicks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
__fi__ Now , the most common interpretation of this , which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks , is a Freudian view , and that is that this chap — and the same argument applies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
__fi__ When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother .
__fi__ This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud .
__fi__ I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard Freudian view .
__fi__ And then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
__fi__ Thank God , or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .
__fi__ And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
__fi__ And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexually turned on ?
__fi__ She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impostor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain .
__fi__ This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
__fi__ It &apos;s very ingenious , as all Freudian arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same delusion , a patient having the same delusion , about his pet poodle . ( Laughter )
__fi__ He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doctor , this is not Fifi . It looks exactly like Fifi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
__fi__ Now , you try using the Freudian explanation there .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absurd , of course .
__fi__ Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
__fi__ So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain .
__fi__ Normally , visual signals come in , into the eyeballs , go to the visual areas in the brain .
__fi__ There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus , where you perceive faces .
__fi__ There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
__fi__ You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
__fi__ I talked about that earlier .
__fi__ Now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
__fi__ But from that area , the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the amygdala , gauges the emotional significance of what you &apos;re looking at .
__fi__ Is it prey ? Is it predator ? Is it mate ?
__fi__ Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lint , or a piece of chalk , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a shoe , or something like that ? OK ?
__fi__ Which you can completely ignore .
__fi__ So if the amygdala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .
__fi__ Your heart starts beating faster .
__fi__ You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
__fi__ And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating .
__fi__ So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re aroused , or not , OK ?
__fi__ And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
__fi__ So my idea was , when this chap looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s processed in the fusiform gyrus , and you recognize it as a pea plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
__fi__ And then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
__fi__ But maybe , in this chap , that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
__fi__ So because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warmth ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
__fi__ ( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions ?
__fi__ This can &apos;t be my mother .
__fi__ It &apos;s some strange woman pretending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
__fi__ Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your galvanic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you sweat when you see an object , like a table or an umbrella . Of course , you don &apos;t sweat .
__fi__ If I show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
__fi__ And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start sweating .
__fi__ You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
__fi__ You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
__fi__ Tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the galvanic skin response is flat .
__fi__ There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
__fi__ So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
__fi__ It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
__fi__ By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room — phones him — and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
__fi__ Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
__fi__ You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__fi__ The reason is there &apos;s a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
__fi__ So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
__fi__ When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impostor .
__fi__ OK , how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain ?
__fi__ Is it nature , genes , or is it nurture ?
__fi__ And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb .
__fi__ And you all know what a phantom limb is .
__fi__ When an arm is amputated , or a leg is amputated , for gangrene , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a phantom arm or a phantom leg .
__fi__ In fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
__fi__ Believe it or not , even with internal viscera .
__fi__ I &apos;ve had patients with the uterus removed — hysterectomy — who have a phantom uterus , including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month .
__fi__ And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get phantom PMS ? &quot;
__fi__ ( Laughter ) A subject ripe for scientific enquiry , but we haven &apos;t pursued that .
__fi__ OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
__fi__ One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom .
__fi__ It &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
__fi__ These are very compelling , vivid sensations .
__fi__ The patient &apos;s not delusional .
__fi__ He knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
__fi__ But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
__fi__ The phantom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
__fi__ It &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
__fi__ If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?
__fi__ It sounds like an oxymoron .
__fi__ But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs , the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury .
__fi__ The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed , was cut , by say , a motorcycle accident .
__fi__ So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a sling for a few months or a year , and then , in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon amputates the arm , and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains , right ?
__fi__ And this is a serious clinical problem .
__fi__ Patients become depressed .
__fi__ Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
__fi__ So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
__fi__ Now , why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb ?
__fi__ When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paralyzed , and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation , and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself .
__fi__ Why does this happen ?
__fi__ When the arm was intact , but paralyzed , the brain sends commands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Move , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Move . No . Move . No . Move . No .
__fi__ And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain , and we call this learned paralysis , OK ?
__fi__ The brain learns , because of this Hebbian , associative link , that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm .
__fi__ And then , when you &apos;ve amputated the arm , this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom , OK ?
__fi__ Now , how do you help these patients ?
__fi__ How do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
__fi__ Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
__fi__ Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
__fi__ How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
__fi__ But that costs millions of dollars .
__fi__ So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
__fi__ You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
__fi__ He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
__fi__ He had a brachial avulsion , so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed , lying in a sling for a year , and then the arm was amputated .
__fi__ He had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
__fi__ It was a paralyzed phantom arm .
__fi__ So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
__fi__ And the patient puts his phantom left arm , which is clenched and in spasm , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same posture , the clenched posture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
__fi__ He looks at the phantom being resurrected , because he &apos;s looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected .
__fi__ &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , wiggle your phantom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving , right ?
__fi__ That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again , and the pain , the clenching spasm , is relieved . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your reflection of your phantom . &quot; &quot; And he started giggling , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my phantom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
__fi__ He knows it &apos;s a mirror reflection , but it &apos;s a vivid sensory experience .
__fi__ Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand and phantom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my phantom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Move your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my phantom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
__fi__ And my pain is being relieved . &quot; &quot; OK ?
__fi__ And then I said , &quot; &quot; Close your eyes . &quot; &quot; He closes his eyes .
__fi__ &quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
__fi__ &quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s clenched again . &quot;
__fi__ &quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
__fi__ &quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
__fi__ So , he was like a kid in a candy store .
__fi__ So , I said , OK , this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
__fi__ But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology , like stroke , focal dystonias — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
__fi__ So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
__fi__ Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
__fi__ I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doctor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this phantom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
__fi__ It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , ethics and all of that ?
__fi__ And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bother you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
__fi__ But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so I can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of magician .
__fi__ Now , why does this happen ?
__fi__ It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
__fi__ It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back .
__fi__ On the other hand , there &apos;s no proprioception , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
__fi__ And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no phantom , there is no arm , right ?
__fi__ It goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
__fi__ And when the arm disappears , the bonus is , the pain disappears because you can &apos;t have disembodied pain floating out there , in space .
__fi__ So , that &apos;s the bonus .
__fi__ Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation .
__fi__ Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
__fi__ But , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
__fi__ This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
__fi__ OK , let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia .
__fi__ This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century .
__fi__ He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
__fi__ He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
__fi__ Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is chartreuse , nine is indigo , OK ?
__fi__ Bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
__fi__ Or C sharp — sometimes , tones evoke color .
__fi__ C sharp is blue , F sharp is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
__fi__ Why does this happen ?
__fi__ This is called synesthesia . Galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
__fi__ In us , all the senses are distinct .
__fi__ These people muddle up their senses .
__fi__ Why does this happen ?
__fi__ One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing .
__fi__ Synesthesia runs in families , so Galton said this is a hereditary basis , a genetic basis .
__fi__ Secondly , synesthesia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — synesthesia is eight times more common among artists , poets , novelists and other creative people than in the general population .
__fi__ Why would that be ?
__fi__ I &apos;m going to answer that question .
__fi__ It &apos;s never been answered before .
__fi__ OK , what is synesthesia ? What causes it ?
__fi__ Well , there are many theories .
__fi__ One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
__fi__ Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
__fi__ Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads , right ?
__fi__ Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in synesthesia . All right ?
__fi__ So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
__fi__ So we said , there &apos;s some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain .
__fi__ So , every time you see a number , you see a corresponding color , and that &apos;s why you get synesthesia .
__fi__ Now remember — why does this happen ?
__fi__ Why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
__fi__ Remember I said it runs in families ?
__fi__ That gives you the clue .
__fi__ And that is , there is an abnormal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .
__fi__ In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
__fi__ So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
__fi__ So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates , then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas .
__fi__ And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get number-color synesthesia .
__fi__ If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get tone-color synesthesia .
__fi__ So far , so good .
__fi__ Now , what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-connected ?
__fi__ Well , think about what artists , novelists and poets have in common , the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking , linking seemingly unrelated ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juliet is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juliet is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glowing ball of fire ?
__fi__ I mean , schizophrenics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
__fi__ Normal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radiant like the sun , she &apos;s nurturing like the sun .
__fi__ Instantly , you &apos;ve found the links .
__fi__ Now , if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia .
__fi__ And , hence , the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets , artists and novelists .
__fi__ OK , it &apos;s a very phrenological view of synesthesia .
__fi__ The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
__fi__ ( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all synesthetes , but you &apos;re in denial about it .
__fi__ Here &apos;s what I call Martian alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
__fi__ Different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
__fi__ Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
__fi__ One of them is Kiki , one of them is Bouba .
__fi__ Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba ?
__fi__ How many of you think that &apos;s Kiki and that &apos;s Bouba ? Raise your hands .
__fi__ Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
__fi__ ( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bouba , that &apos;s Kiki ? Raise your hands .
__fi__ Ninety-nine percent of you .
__fi__ Now , none of you is a Martian . How did you do that ?
__fi__ It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction , meaning you &apos;re saying that that sharp inflection — ki-ki , in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Kiki , mimics the visual inflection , sudden inflection of that jagged shape .
__fi__ Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
__fi__ It &apos;s a primitive form of abstraction , and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain , because when that &apos;s damaged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
__fi__ If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that glitters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
__fi__ You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
__fi__ So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
__fi__ Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
__fi__ And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction , metaphor and creativity .
__fi__ All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
__fi__ Thank you .
__fi__ ( Applause ) Sorry about that .
__fi__ ( Laughter )
__fi__ The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
__fi__ After puberty , we fall off the map .
__fi__ She &apos;s a six-monther .
__fi__ ( Applause )
__fi__ I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
__fi__ If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
__fi__ Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
__fi__ Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
__fi__ I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
__fi__ And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
__fi__ My left hemisphere , our left hemisphere , is a very different place .
__fi__ Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
__fi__ And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
__fi__ And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
__fi__ And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
__fi__ And I felt lighter in my body .
